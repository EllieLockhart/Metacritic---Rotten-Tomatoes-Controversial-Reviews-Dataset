Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was just awesome. I can't understand the people that hate this movie. The beginning was not as good as the middle and te end but it was still good. In the middle you could see a very good character development and the fight scenes were just awesome.","true":true}
