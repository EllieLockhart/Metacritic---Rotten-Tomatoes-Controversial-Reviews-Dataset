Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed. A collection of senseless disorganized mumbo jumbo. Plots don't add up. Actors and actresses have no charisma\\, very amateurish. The entire crypto subplot is a completely unimaginative\\, illogical\\, and third-grade knock-off of gazillions of scifi movies and tvs. I can't believe a Star War movie has come to such a low point of creativity. Sorry to say if Rogue One is a 4\/5 TLJ is 1\\, or less.","true":true}
