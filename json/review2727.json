Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful film\\, just awful. Rian Johnson is an arrogent duchebag who has thrown aside years of myth to do 'his own thing'. Wouldn't be so bad if it was actually a good thing\\, but this is just trash\\, superman Leia was an epic fail\\, making Luke out to be a hobo coward who tried to kill his own nephew in his sleep after fighting to save Darth Vader makes no sense at all\\, killing Snoke with no back story was a mistake\\, same one made in.the phantom menace with Darth maul\\, showing Rey to be a nobody was a bad joke. This film just doesn't feel like star wars at all\\, completely the wrong tone. The problem is\\, the movie has so many political references in it that I suspect reviewers have felt obliged to give it a thumbs up.","true":true}
