Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whether or not you like this movie largely depends on how closely you look at it. For the casual fan who wants a good light show it works. For those who enjoying taking a deeper look or are generally annoyed by obvious plot holes this movie will leave you frustrated and downright angry at times. For those expecting questions that were asked in Force Awakens will surely be disappointed. Beneath the facade of good acting and pretty pictures is a hollow mess that stands as a blasphemous blight in the star wars mythos.","true":true}
