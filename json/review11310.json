Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honoring the source material\\, funny\\, a little punny\\, with the right amount of unexpected moments and twists to keep me on the edge of my seat. Great themes including martyrdom\\, failure\\, commitment\\, and hope. A must see!","true":true}
