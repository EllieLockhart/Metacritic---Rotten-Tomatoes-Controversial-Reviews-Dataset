Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A rather messy collection of foolish plots. Andy Serkis pulls off a brilliant CGI Snoak\\, a character wasted by his demise. Kylo Ren taking over the First Order with a bit of light choking hardly seems like a strong basis for constitutional government. The casino\/hacker plot is really weird and the main plot is contradicted by its own ending. Briefly\\, General Organa turns into The Flying Nun. The connection between Kylo and Daisy however was marvellously done: regrettably it was the only human connection in the entire film and seemed to be from a totally different movie. Meh.","true":true}
