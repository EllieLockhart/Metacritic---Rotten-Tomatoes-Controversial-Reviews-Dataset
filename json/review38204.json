Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst installment in the entire Star Wars canon (shows\\, books\\, movies). Undoes what was great about TFA\\, spits in the face of the OT\\, and even horrible on its own.","true":true}
