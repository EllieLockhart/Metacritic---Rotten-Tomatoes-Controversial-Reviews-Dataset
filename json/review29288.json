Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey\\, the force genius\\, ruins every other jedi story. \\nWhy jedi master trained their padawan from young age? They could find some kids who can use force and give them lightsaber to become jedi. The conclusion of this movie said that Sith and Jedi were the fools who wasted their entire time for \\\"training\\\". including Luke\\, Yoda\\, and Darth Vader.","true":true}
