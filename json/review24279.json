Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"mess of a movie to many plot holes things that make no sense or  just there to further the plot but with no meaning... bad movie bad writing ... and as a result ... i dont care about what happens next... not expecting nothing at all from ep 9","true":true}
