Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's start with the strengths of the film. The Last Jedi has very strong thematic elements highlighting the failures of its cast of characters. From minor oversights\\, to serious loss of life scenarios. The movie focuses in on these \\n\\nevents\\, often to its own detriment. With characters frequently avoiding the penalties of lack of planning\\, poor decision making\\, and on occasion events that should lead to death. While there certainly is plenty of death\\, our beloved main \\n\\ncast survives unscathed at almost every turn\\, whether it be from dumb luck\\, or impossible lore breaking developments. All of this manages to do very little in terms of moving the lore along\\, or adding to the legacy. Where previous movies \\n\\nspan months\\, and cross vast distances\\, introducing exotic locales\\, building a sense of scale\\, and scope. The majority of Last Jedi takes place in a span of a few hours\\, and is comprised of a single major event. This forces the film to \\n\\nfocus inward towards the characters themselves\\, and the decisions that are made. Therein lies the major issue with this film\\, whereas characters like Han Solo\\, and Anakin Skywalker(Pre-vader)\\, were known for flying by the seat of there \\n\\npants\\, and making ends meet. Most major events in the Star Wars Saga thus far were well planned\\, and informed strikes. An obvious example is the destruction of the first Death Star\\, where an entire briefing was shown to the viewer. In \\n\\nLast Jedi every character has seemingly forgot how to plan\\, discuss\\, or act with any coherent purpose. With every situation flying off the handle and being out of control from the get go.What this means is that we dont recieve any \\n\\ngratification from seeing a well planned effort succeed\\, we dont see any payoff from a successfull mission\\, and we dont see our characters learn from the failures they have\\, because with few exceptions all consequences are null and void\\n\\n(We will discuss this in plot). What it presents in terms of theme essentially breaks down to\\, \\\"It doesnt matter if you have no idea what you are doing\\, as long as you have good intentions it will work out\\\". \\n\\n\tNow let us move on to where the film really shows its stripes\\, the plot. First off Last Jedi has so many plot holes\\, there is barely any plot left. If you did manage to sort all the holes\\, you would end up with a 5 minute movie\\, \\n\\nwhere nothing happened at all. Instead we end up with a 2 hour movie\\, where almost nothing happens. On top of this the writing is intensely formulaic. A problem is create by a poor decision\\, this problem then presents its consequence\\, \\n\\nthe consequence is promptly removed\\, or in some cases never existed. This formula is repeated over and over ad nauseum teh entire film\\, to the point where you could mark an \\\"X\\\" for every decision and consequence\\, followed by a \\\"O\\\" for a \\n\\nrandom stroke of luck resolving it. resulting in a paper filled with \\\"xxo\\\". The few instances where a major event occurs or may occur\\, no context is given to what it may actually mean\\, and it is swept under the rug rather than being \\n\\nfleshed out. Conflict between major characters is resolved with explosions knocking one or the other unconcious instead of resolution. Every major moment is immediately derailed by circumstance\\, preventing anything meaningful from \\n\\nactually occuring. A far cry to what an entry to the Star Wars universe should be.","true":true}
