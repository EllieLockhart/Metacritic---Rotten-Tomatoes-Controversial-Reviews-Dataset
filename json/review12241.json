Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am left with the feeling of total disappointment. Everything that was \\\"magic\\\" about the Jedi and whole Skywalker's family history went to rubbish. My wallet still feels a distaste right now. Unfortunately\\, that is maximum of how far I can follow this narration. Not going to SW IX for sure.","true":true}
