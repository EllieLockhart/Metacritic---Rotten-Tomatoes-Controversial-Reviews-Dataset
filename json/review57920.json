Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible movie!! Way to ruin everyone's childhood that's saw these first two trilogies....the way that TOS and the Prequels were disregarded to make way for sales instead of actually telling a compelling story arc on line with the first two trilogies is absolutely disgusting I wish I never devoted any second to STAR WARS","true":true}
