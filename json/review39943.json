Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is easily the worst Star Wars Movie ever made. Disney decided to create new abilities that were really reaching in this flick. As a reader of the books\\, cannon and non cannon\\, as well as the comics\\, I thought this was something totally different from what star wars is. Too many holes\\, I have more questions\\, and dialogue was horrible. No character development and there were characters that I didn't know why they were there. completely disappointed.","true":true}
