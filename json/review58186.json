Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yikes this movie was a mess. There was to many plot lines that were squeezed in\\, all former characterization was thrown out the window\\, there were unnecessary plot points\\, characters who were given extremely underwhelming stories\\, and it didn't feel like a star wars movie at all. This move may have been alright had it not taken place in the middle of a trilogy and was some tandom star wars movie. To be honest\\, this movie was extremely disappointing and did very little to redeem itself.","true":true}
