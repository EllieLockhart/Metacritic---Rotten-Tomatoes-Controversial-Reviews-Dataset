Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was amazing. Critics are generally people who get paid to watch films\\, immerse themselves in the craft\\, and understand what makes a good film. It isn't about comparing the film to other films in the franchise. This is about how\\, for example\\, we could compare Mark Hamill's performance in \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" with something like Anthony Hopkins' performance in \\\"The Edge\\\" or another film. Does the film have the elements of a beloved sci-fi film? Maybe not. Does it have the elements of a great film? The critics seem to think so\\, and I tend to agree.","true":true}
