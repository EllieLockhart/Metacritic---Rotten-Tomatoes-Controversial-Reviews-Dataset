Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have issues with the script\\, Mainly the forced humour in places\\, most notably at the beginning of the movie when Poe is trolling Hux ( that was so bad ).\\n\\nThe main glaring problem to me however was Finn and Rose's adventure to the Monaco planet and Del Toro's involvement at all. That whole section of the movie could have been replaced with Finn and Rose just trying to sneak on to the big star destroyer with just the two of them and getting captured reducing playtime by 30 minutes and enabling the time saved to be spent on more character development characters. The whole section felt like a way to introduce this grey character into the universe ( who wasn't even a good character it was just Del Toro doing Del Toro weird things again like he normally does ).\\n\\nOverall the movie was good I can forgive the ridiculous Luke astrally projecting across the galaxy and other force weirdness things\\, I enjoyed Kylo and Rey's interactions definitely the best part of the movie.","true":true}
