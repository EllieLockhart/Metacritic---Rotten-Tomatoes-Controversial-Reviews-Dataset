Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens delivered essentially a rehash of A New Hope\\, Rian Johnson's first foray into the Star Wars universe is a welcome breath of fresh air. Subverting many of the common elements of previous Star Wars films was a bold choice\\, but to this viewer it paid off in an astounding fashion. I was floored from beginning to end by the dramatic tension\\, pacing\\, and story development. The characters we met in TFA continue to grow before us\\, sometimes in ways we never would have predicted. And the older stars of the previous installments shine in this new spotlight provided by Disney. Carrie Fisher gives perhaps her best performance yet as General Leia Organa-Solo-Skywalker - a fitting conclusion for the now deceased actress. I've seen the film 3 times\\, and it got more enjoyable with each viewing. This isn't your average Star Wars movie\\, and that is a very good thing.","true":true}
