{"101487":193252,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WARNING:  SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW\\n\\nTo quote a far-too-often used analogy\\, Star Wars movies are like pizza\\, even bad ones are pretty good.  Having said that\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is about as close to a bad movie watching experience as you can get with a Star Wars movie.  I wanted three things from this latest entry in the Star Wars saga.  First\\, I wanted answers to the intriguing questions JJ Abrams so keenly teased us with in the Force Awakens.  Second\\, I wanted a huge character arc\\, and indeed\\, a shocking change of direction for at least one of the major players in this story.  And Third\\, as a child of the original trilogy and the Luke Skywalker generation\\, I wanted to see the hero we were always promised fully realized as a jedi master \\\"more powerful than you can possibly imagine\\,\\\" to quote Obi Wan Kenobi.  This movie fails miserably on all three of these fronts.\\n\\nStar Wars fans have speculated endlessly on answers to key questions raised in the Force Awakens.  Who are Rey's parents?  Is she related to any iconic Star Wars characters?  Who and where are the Knights of Ren?  Who is Snoke and how did he rise to power?  As countless prior reviews have pointed out\\, the answers to these and other key questions are either completely underwhelming or ignored altogether in The Last Jedi.  It's almost as if Rian Johnson had complete disdain for many of the key plot points raised by JJ Abrams in the Force Awakens and looked to swiftly purge them or ignore them completely.  The most glaring example of this is the unceremonious killing of Snoke without even the slightest explanation of who he was or where he came from.  Snoke\\, the \\\"supreme leader\\\" of the First Order who was presumably the main catalyst behind the First Order's rise to power and the transformation of Ben Solo to Kylo Ren\\, seemingly came from nowhere in the Star Wars universe.  To kill him off as an afterthought without explaining his origins leaves a significant void in the current storyline and insults us as viewers.\\n\\nAll of this could be forgiven if The Last Jedi took us in exciting and unpredictable directions.  Unfortunately\\, for all of the talk of \\\"shocking twists\\\" and \\\"jaw-dropping\\\" moments referenced in many of the mainstream reviews of this movie\\, I found the movie incredibly stagnant with little to no plot movement or character development.  While a few significant characters are killed off\\, The Last Jedi ends with the main protagonists and antagonists\\, most notably\\, Kylo Ren and Rey\\, in virtually the same circumstances they found themselves in at the end of The Force Awakens.  Kylo Ren is leading the dark forces of the First Order against Rey and the rebellion.  Come on\\, Rian!  Why couldn't you throw caution to the wind?  While The Last Jedi teases us with such intriguing possibilities as Rey turning to the dark side or Rey and Kylo Ren joining forces\\, it seems as if Rian Johnson\\, or perhaps Disney\\, didn't have the gumption to let the story go in a truly unexpected direction.\\n\\nFinally\\, I will join the endless chorus of life-long Star Wars fans in bemoaning the almost pathetic final act of our childhood hero\\, Luke Skywalker.  The reason the end of The Force Awakens was so effective is it laid the groundwork for the return of Luke Skywalker\\, Jedi master\\, to play a significant role in the fight against the forces of the dark side.  The Last Jedi takes less than 30 seconds after Luke and Rey meet to trample that narrative\\, giving us Luke Skywalker\\, miserable curmudgeon.  I would have been fine with a slightly jaded and cynical version of Luke had the cranky anti-hero version not taken up 90% of the movie.  When the Luke Skywalker we are familiar with finally does appear\\, it is in the form of a force-induced hologram\\, with Luke ultimately dying from what appeared to be fatigue.  I'm fine with Luke being written off\\, but couldn't we have given him one last meaningful hurrah.  There is not a single Star Wars fan who was not looking forward to seeing Luke in an enthralling light saber duel with Snoke\\, or Kylo Ren\\, or perhaps Rey.  Rian Johnson failed to give us any of that\\, and in so doing\\, punched us in the gut.  Whether JJ Abrams can help us recover from our wounds in Episode IX remains to be seen.\\n\\nJohn Kozak\\, Wannabe Movie Critic","true":true}
