Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I stayed away from predetermined expectations and went into this movie as a fan just looking for a good story. I walked out blown away by the rich depth of entertainment in each act\\, with intriguing new characters like Holdo and Rose... This movie was almost irreverent to the Star Wars movies of the past\\, and it may have not went the way I or anyone else wanted\\, ut this was exactly what this franchise needed. I loved Rey\/Kylo teasing....the stalking Supremacy's decimation of what is left of the Resistance across open space was a throwback to the old Blackbeard pirate movies...the Throne Room scene....Luke's return....the stable boy holding the broom....all of it\\, and yet none of it\\, went the way that I thought it was going to go\\, and the genius of the story was Luke warned us of this early on...great job\\, I cannot wait until Ep9!!!","true":true}
