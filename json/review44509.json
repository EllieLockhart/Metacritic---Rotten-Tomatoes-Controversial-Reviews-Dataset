Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To quote Lucas\\, a beautifully made film that unfortunately misreads one of the fundamental characters from the original trilogy. This is not a Star Wars film ... and plot holes abound. \\n\\nIt is incredibly difficult to write this as someone who was genuinely excited for Rian to be onboad this franchise but this film has now the additional effect of making what little was intriguing about its predecessor\\, irrelevant.","true":true}
