Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in not expecting too much as its hard to compare the old Star Wars with any of the new.  I was pleasantly surprised at a couple of the twists despite them being consistent with Star Wars lore.  The dialogue was pretty good as was the relationship growth between most of the characters.  However\\, the overall story was a little clunky and much of it seemed forced.  Honestly many of the scenes could have been cut to create a better flow throughout.  All in all\\, I enjoyed it. I look forward to seeing this and the next instalment again and again.","true":true}
