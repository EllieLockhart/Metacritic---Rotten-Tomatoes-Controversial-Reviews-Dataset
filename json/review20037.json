Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was just a good movie\\, but not great.  There was way to much comedy relief and only a few of them hit their mark.  Also the big choreographed fight light saber fight scene seemed poorly done.  It looked like the timing was off on some of the fighters and\/or they were slow in their motions.  I know disney will milk this cash cow until it is in ruins\\, but I really wish they would stop after the next movie.","true":true}
