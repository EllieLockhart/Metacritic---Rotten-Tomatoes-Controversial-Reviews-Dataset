Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was one of the best Star Wars movies yet.  I feel like the complainers are the ones who thought they had it all figured out and the movie was different.  I purposely avoid all speculation and discussion around these movies so that I can see them completely fresh and form my OWN opinions.  I can't stop thinking about the movie and can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
