Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely has some very strong points as well as some holes too. If you view it with the idea that it's part of a trilogy and not a stand alone\\, it's easier to accept it's flaws which surface as much of the movie feels like character development with a story interlaced (IE\\, filler). I still thoroughly enjoyed it more than episodes 1-3. Not having Lucas with overarching control is the best thing to happen to this series since the original three.","true":true}
