Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely confused by my fellow fans.  There on opening night\\, and if people asked\\, I thought it was Empire Good.  Loved the twists and turns\\, the humor\\, and the cinematography.  Went with 8 people\\, and we all loved it.  Will be going for a second viewing next week.  I think some of your are taking Kylo Ren's bait about Rey.","true":true}
