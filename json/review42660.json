Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was entertaining\\, fun\\, and didn't take itself so seriously. Of course there are things I wish were further explained and some pointless but again entertaining scenes. When it comes to things being further explained people have to remember there is another movie coming out! I don't know what others are expecting the movie to be\\, because there is NO was for them to create the exact same movie and feeling you had the first time you saw 4-6. This movie did what I wanted out of a movie. Took me out of reality and into the world of Star Wars. I will be going to see it again to see what little things I missed because there were things my boyfriend say that I didn't and vise versa!","true":true}
