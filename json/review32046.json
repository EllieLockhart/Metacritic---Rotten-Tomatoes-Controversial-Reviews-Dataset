{"101487":169483,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-14","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"--- SPOILERS ---\\n\\nI really wanted to like this film. I thought that Force Awakens was a reasonable effort at moving the saga forward for the new generations\\, providing that the many questions it posed were resolved. Snoke was an intriguing character and I was sort of invested in Rey\\, whilst desperate to understand the source of her immediate\\, untrained power\\, and why she could best arguably the closest thing to a Sith heir the galaxy posed in Kylo Ren. Didn't care much for Po\\, seemed fairly underdeveloped\\, and perhaps a little more for Finn. Who is he? \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was definitely a spectacle\\, to it's credit. It was funny in places\\, although now I'm not sure if the humour was in fact a device to cover up the fairly convoluted plot. The first act was pretty great. Seeing Leia suspended in space (in that scene) and returning to the ship was exciting. All that said\\, I think it's easier to highlight my problems with the film with a series of questions I'd like answered since the film ended\\, after I had been struck with a strong sense of disappointment and regret for the franchise:\\n\\n\\nWhy is Rey so powerful? Still?\\n\\nWho are we actually meant to be rooting against? Supreme leader is dead\\, Kylo is conflicted (and dare I say it\\, actually quite likable in this film). After the destruction of Starkiller base in TFA\\, and the recent presentation of the pitifully tame First Order and General Hux\\, where is the sense of foreboding and underlying menace? A film is only as good as it's villain\\, and there isn't one anymore - or at least one that presents any real danger. (I understand them trying to play the GOT style moral ambiguity and grey areas but this is not executed well\\, in my opinion). Who cares if Rey can now lift a million rocks if there's no driving force behind it all?\\n\\nHow can people review this well\\, and criticize Lucas for his poor dialogue in the prequels? It seems like some lines\\, such as \\\"Salt...\\\"\\, were entered just to remind the audience in the final scenes that the setting wasn't snowy Hoth\\, to avoid Empire comparisons. \\n\\nI'll summarise my other issues:\\n- I'm sorry\\, although I appreciate the diversity\\, I don't believe Finn and Rose's relationship or chemistry\\n- Captain Phasma - who cares. Defeated in less than a minute. No payoff. A glorified toy.\\n- Underwritten or badly handled characters; why do I care about Po (impulsive jerk)\\, Hux (comic relief useless supervillain)\\, Chewie\/R2D2\/3PO (pointless fan service appearances)\\, Luke (Really? A disgruntled\\, stubborn old man who easily changes his mind\/30 year motivations\\, and does some reluctant force decoying before returning to the force. Great. The hero of the Star Wars saga everyone.) Codebreaker (Who? Why do I care?)\\n- For one reason or another\\, all the major moments missed their emotional impact\/the mark substantially for me; no gut punches. Fairly emotionally sterile.\\n- A true visualisation of a DISNEYFIED Star Wars; the film was marketed to be a dark reflection of the Saga\\, and was ANYTHING but. No consequences. Humour in the wrong places\\, surface level on all levels\\, introducing little boys and girls as the next Resistance fighters. Adorable\\, needless creatures (more toys). No real evil presence. After Rogue One I thought Disney may be changing their tune. This film was made for A - a popcorn flick audience\\, and B - 10 year old boys\/girls.\\n- CLICHE CLICHE CLICHE - Case in point\\, \\\"The spark is lost\\\". *Look down solemnly. *Spark in eyes. \\\"Luke!?\\\" *Luke appears in shadowy alcove.  \\n\\nWhat pains me a little is that no-one really seems to be comfortable confronting this film. I am convinced\\, with a equivalent film of different stature\\, without a hyper-billion dollar corporate\\, commercial pull behind it\\, that people would be ubiquitously highlighting the glaring issues it has. The film opened to huge critical acclaim\\, and I don't for one second believe that these a portion of reviewers haven't been paid off. I refuse to believe that mankind can be so shallow\\, and genuinely satisfied with the continuation of the saga in this direction\\, with all the glaring plot holes\\, underwritten character development and foggy motivations that everyone in this movie has. \\n\\nI may just be wrong\\, expecting too much of a saga that is may now essentially just be Fantasy Science-Fiction made for children to sell toys. I am willing to accept that perhaps everyone else is right and I am just not the right audience for this film - but I'll have nothing more to do with this beloved Saga if that's the case for the future of the franchise.\\n\\nI'll leave you with this: http:\/\/www.gamesradar.com\/5-questions-star-wars-force-awakens-left-us-spoilers\/\\n\\nIt's called 14 questions that The Last Jedi NEEDS to answer\\, I assume to avoid audience frustration. I counted 2\/3 that were even half-addressed.. Given that this reputable company\\, \\\"Games Radar\\\"\\, quickly changed their tune after the film's release to basically lick it's arse\\, presenting 12 new\\, often unrelated questions to be answered after seeing the film - I'd say it's a good reflection of the inability of a review site to criticise such a commercial behemoth. \\n\\nThe force was weak with this one. I'd go as far as to say that in retrospect\\, a year from now\\, this may well be the new Phantom Menace\\, and the nail in the coffin for the Saga for life-long fans (especially knowing Rian is in the helm for the foreseeable future). It makes you long for the prequels and George Lucas' grand ideas and foresight. I feel like Harrison Ford will be pleased he's out\\, Mark Hamill will soon confirm his true colours and of course poor Carrie is already lost. \\n\\nDark times indeed.","true":true}
