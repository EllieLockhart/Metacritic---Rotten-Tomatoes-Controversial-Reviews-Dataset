Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever. Wait\\, worst Star Wars THING ever. A bad combination of lame jokes\\, unimportant scenes and choices that didn't stay true to characters. Basically destroys the jedi and everything they fought for. Makes it seem As if you can't stand up for what you believe in or you might hurt someone's feelings and they'll go kill a bunch of people and it's your fault. The best part of the movie was when Garreth Edwards had a cameo\\, I thought \\\"oh\\, someone that's a true Star Wars fan.\\\" If you want to see luke drink green milk out of swollen alliens nipples and make a weird face\\, 10\/10 recommend.","true":true}
