Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie's storyline and twists. However\\, what made me not enjoy the movie as much was the sense of forced comedy. In my opinion\\, some of the jokes were so overtly forced or expository of the previous Star Wars movies\\, that it took me out of the feeling that this was a true universe. Personally\\, it was these jokes that made me not enjoy the movie as much. Some people may have liked the humour\\, but for me it took me out of the immersion of the Star Wars galaxy. However\\, that being said\\, if you can get over the humour there is a solid storyline. Again\\, I just feel the jokes took me out of the impression that this was a true universe and not just a movie. I do hope that the next movie will not become just a crowd pleaser; however\\, because\\, again\\, the twists were good!","true":true}
