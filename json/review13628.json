{"101487":131941,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-11","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If ever there was a movie to make you lose faith in the field of paid movie critics\\, this is it. The glowing reviews done by the majority of \\\"professional\\\" critics looks like some repugnant fetish for anything \\\"subversive\\,\\\" no matter how clumsily\\, poorly thought out\\, and defacing to the original property the \\\"subversion\\\" is. Subversion can be a great thing when it's skillfully done. It isn't here.\\n\\nThis is a bad movie. It's tempting to focus on the poor pacing\\, overly long run time\\, plot holes\\, and general aura of incompetence the characters labor under (Holdo keeping her plan secret despite knowing the Resistance fighters are in a desperate situation and badly demoralized; the amazingly inept plan to go to the casino planet that felt stupidly circuitous the moment it was spoken\\, let alone executed\\, in the movie\\, etc.)\\n\\nBut while its tempting to look at those things\\, which make it a bad watch\\, the worst thing about it is simply Rian Johnson's decision that time and old age had made Luke into essentially the opposite of what he was\\, to the point where the audience feels disgust with a person they were fond of. Luke is an apathetic jerk. It may subvert audience expectations\\, but only because it demonstrates a complete disrespect for the original trilogy that birthed the franchise.\\n\\nFinally\\, this movie doesn't just damage the original trilogy\\, it also retroactively makes the Force Awakens look like a time bomb of bad ideas that have now gone off. The decisions to have the First Order just replace the Empire\\, Snoke replace the Emperor\\, Luke replace Obi Wan as a Jedi who taught a corrupted pupil... it all undermined the accomplishments of the first films\\, but at least the audience believed we'd get a serious and intelligent effort in the Last Jedi to answer the questions of how that happened. No such effort was made. Force Awakens was derivative and never thought two steps ahead. The Last Jedi cements that no effort was put into thinking those things through\\, while taking a seemingly perverse pleasure in tainting whatever fond feelings you still had for Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nI'd prefer to give this movie zero stars if I could\\, but since the lowest score you can give is half a star\\, I'll say that the half-star goes to the music\\, which remains stellar (John Williams has never disappointed with any soundtrack\\, the soundtrack is the only good thing to come out of this movie).","true":true}
