Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge plot holes\\, a multitude of political agendas integrated into the story\\, bad writing\\, useless and undeveloped characters\\, the absolute decimation of cult hero and cinematic icon Luke Skywalker. By far the worst in the series\\, I don't recognise this as Star Wars cannon\\, the film is an insult to the franchise and wont be watching any more SW work from Rian Johnson.","true":true}
