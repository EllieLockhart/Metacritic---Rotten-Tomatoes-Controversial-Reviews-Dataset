Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a movie. The final half hour was incredible. I would give it 5 but there unfortunately were some very slow parts\\, not to mention a plot in the middle that didn\u2019t make much sense in the overall scheme of the movie. But overall a great movie!","true":true}
