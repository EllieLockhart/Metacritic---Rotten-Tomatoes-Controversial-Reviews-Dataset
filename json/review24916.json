Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favourite Star Wars movie. Absolutely brilliant. Risks taken\\, out with the old in with the new\\, a few bits of nostalgia and epic visuals. Watched it four times and gets better with every time. 9.5\/10.","true":true}
