Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was disappointing. Luke Skywalker\\, who was supposed to be the most powerful Jedi ever is just a \\\"grumpy old master who gave up\\\". The Last Jedi wasted the opportunity to make all Star Wars fans witness the true powers of the force from its master. Killing off Luke just wasted the opportunity and killed the actual Skywalker bloodline. Luke Skywalker\\, who lost his mother at birth and never knew her\\, saw his uncle and aunt burn\\, lost his arm\\, and lost his father just after redemption never got a happy ending or a family. He instead died because of \\\"space FaceTime\\\". Rey is just the daughter of two junkies but somehow is strong with the force WITHOUT training. Even Anakin wasn't that instantly strong. And the whole casino scene didn't make any since nor did it contribute to the story. Kylo Ren\\, who was supposed to become more powerful in the dark side after killing his father and MAGICALLY losing to \\\"nobody\\\" Rey is just the same old emo. Snoke who was so strong is somehow just a nobody. But most importantly\\, we didn't even get a lightsaber duel...","true":true}
