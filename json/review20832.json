Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to like this since it used to be a good franchise. However\\, this just isn't good. Not once was there any tension to be felt and not one plot turn was surprising. Not one character has depth and neither does the plot. Disney took a dying franchise and turned it to shit. Anyone feeling this is looking with triple rose tinted glasses and closed eyes. This is just a steaming pile of shit with a recognizable name.","true":true}
