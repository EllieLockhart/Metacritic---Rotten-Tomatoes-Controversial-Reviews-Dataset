Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Horrible writing. Plot holes everywhere. Meaningless side plots. Weak conflict. Overly cutesy BS creatures. Absolute disregard for beloved characters. Wastes excellent new characters for no reason. The acting from Adam Driver and Mark Hamill was great\\, but that doesn't change the fact that their characters were disrespected by the writers. The half star is for them and only them.","true":true}
