Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took me a long time to think about that rating but there's something that makes me want to watch this movie again and it has a lingering lasting effect which is the mark of a good film maybe I'll appreciate it more in 10 years.","true":true}
