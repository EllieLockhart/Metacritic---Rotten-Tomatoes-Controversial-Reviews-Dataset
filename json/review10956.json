Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Have never used RT before and literally am signing up to post this. Huge Star Wars fan since childhood but don't wear rose-colored glasses. I thought TFA was highly flawed (it's a remake) but entertaining and went into TLJ with an open mind. What I got was the worst movie I've seen all year and - I can't believe I'm typing this in a world where TPM exists - the worst Star Wars movie ever. A massive disappointment that is wildly overlong\\, makes no sense and does lasting damage to what has come before. There was audible grumbling from the audience on the way out. Really sad to type this but it's true. Doesn't seem like I'm alone in thinking this either based on the audience scores. Sad morning.","true":true}
