Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's neither a five nor a zero star. If you read both positive and negative reviews you'll actually see the same problems bothered people at both ends of the spectrum. I appreciate they took risks and I hope they take risks in episode 8. If you've ever thought Star Wars had too much plot and not enough action then this is the movie for you. I like a good mix of plot vs action. This movie is non-stop action with very brief shining moments of interesting plot points that come as needed breaths of fresh air\\, but all to quickly they are broken up by seemingly endless action scenes and so the movie starts to feel long & viewers become disconnected. Don't get me wrong I love space battles and saber duels as much as the next person\\, but too much action made this film feel like a demo reel for special effects capability. To be fair\\, there's some beautiful visuals\\, fun creatures\\, and even a little fun humor thrown in and the acting is really good. This was a 4-5 star movie crowded out by endless action loosely explained by brief plot points\u2014many of which feel weak or disconnected. Meanwhile\\, other points seemed interesting enough to merit more than the brief interruption to the action that they were. Spoilers ahead. Mark Hamill played his character so well! He brought depth\\, humanity\\, bitterness\\, regret and more. Wow. While not the direction I thought they would go\\, Mark did give it his all and I enjoyed all of his scenes. I would have loved to see his unconventional sarcastic style of training Ray\\, but I guess we are simply told Ray needs no training so that we can get back to less interesting explosions. In fact I felt the majority of actors did good during their brief glimpses between CGI explosions. Also what was with the bull running scene? It seemed a bizarre interruption to the film. Also that girl falls in love with Finn? Did I miss that in a deleted scene? I do really like the theme that men fall short without women in their lives to help them be better than themselves\\, but even this cool idea seemed a little overplayed. I'd be fine with 90 percent of men in the galaxy being bastards and 90 percent of the women being saints\\, but it did start to feel like all men had the monopoly on being evil prideful weak cowards and that all women are always right\\, smarter\\, more powerful\\, more courageous\\, and completely flawless. Why not just tell Po the plan earlier? Not a fan of the Admiral Holdo character and can't help but feel the writing is to blame there. If empire strikes back is a five star and episode 2 is a zero star then 2-3 stars for this movie makes sense. My list of best to worst goes 5\\, 4\\, 6 ties 7\\, 1\\, 3 & 8 tie\\, and 2 dead last.","true":true}
