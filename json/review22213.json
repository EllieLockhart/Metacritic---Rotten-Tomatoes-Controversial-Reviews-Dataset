Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"La fuerza vuelve de la mano del director de \\\"Looper\\\"\\, una de esas grandiosas pel\u00edculas que pocos ven. Rian Johnson logr\u00f3 darle una una nueva identidad a la franquicia\\, le quit\u00f3 la m\u00e1scara y da origen a una nueva esperanza\\, los papeles de Driver\\, Ridley e Isaac se consolidan y dan otra cara muy diferente al episodio VII que poco o nada daba de nuevo. La antorcha se ha pasado de mano y una nueva historia comienza.","true":false}
