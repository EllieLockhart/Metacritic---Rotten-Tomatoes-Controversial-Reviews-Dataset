Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like funny things\\, but the humor in this had terrible timing. Characters seem to act irrationally and there's not enough back story or character development to explain why. Luke in this movie is not luke from the other movies. They barely explain what happened to him between ep7 and now. Most sub plots are removable\\, with no real reason except to find some way to include certain characters in the movie. I know there's no reason to expect a sci-fi movie to be realistic\\, but it should be consistent with itself. SPOILER****** they act suprised when the empire tracks their ships through lightspeed\\, yet that's basically the reason for half of the plot of ep4. They track Leia to the rebel base in that movie. Also\\, by the end of the movie\\, the rebel alliance basically has so few people they can all fit comfortably in the millenium falcon. As far as I'm concerned\\, this movie didn't happen.\\nI legitimately hope they remake this movie instead of releasing ep9.\\n\\nI am yet another person who made an account just to review this movie because I was so disappointed in it.","true":true}
