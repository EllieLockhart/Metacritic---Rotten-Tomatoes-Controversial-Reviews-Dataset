Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an amazing movie! It was full of humor and romance. It was nice to see a good balance of men and women in power\/leading roles. BB-8 was a naughty little stud and the porgs were cute. Only critique was the length. I sat through 20 min of previews and then 2.5 hour movie... ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. ","true":true}
