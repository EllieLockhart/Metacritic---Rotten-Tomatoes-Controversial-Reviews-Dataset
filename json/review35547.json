{"101487":175112,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi - I really don't know how to review this hot mess of a movie without my review itself being a hot mess.\\nBut I am going to try anyway\\, because I certainly cant do a worse job of this review than Rian Johnson did in making this movie. \\n(As a side note\\, for a company like Disney who has fired so many directors in the past number of years\\, to have let this movie come out astounds me. Even worse they are giving him the keys to the kingdom for 3 more movies......  Well to quote an old classmate of mine\\, What are you on and Where can I get some?)\\nSo you can see from my profile picture here that I am somewhat a fan of Star Wars\\, The Return of the Jedi was the first movie I remember seeing in Theaters and I have been watching these movies on opening that out of the way\\, I will go into my review. Of course there are Spoilers below.\\nThe Force Awakens was essentially a remake\\, complete fan service\\, and a fanboy homage to a movie that has inspired millions. And while it was not a perfect movie\\, I loved it\\, I saw it and was reminded of everything Star Wars could be. It began transitioning from the Old Guard to the New Generation\\, we met Rey\\, and Finn\\, and Poe\\, and BB8\\, we saw some menace in Kylo Ren\\, and we were intrigued by the image of Supreme Leader Snoke. When we left the theater after seeing the Force Awakens we had a myriad of questions flowing through our heads:\\nWho are Rey's Parents?\\nHow tall is Snoke?\\nWho is Snoke?\\nHow did Snoke get those gnarly scars?\\nWhy did Kylo Ren turn to the dark side?\\nWhy did Luke run away?\\nIn short we were left wondering. And curiosity and a sense of wonderment a really critical to any film franchise\\, that drive to know what happens next is why we all buy tickets to see the next movie. \\nBut in writing The Last Jedi Rian Johnson was more interested in cleaning the slate from the previous movies than he was in creating any buildup for the next movie\\, or in even telling his own story. This movie is the film equivalent of a child walking into a sandbox destroying all the castles built by others and then sitting in the corner sulking. You could have forgiven them if they had been clearing the space to build their own masterpiece. But creation had nothing to do with it. Even the foundation set by The Force Awakens had to be torn down in the most uninspired way possible.\\nSo lets look at those questions above and see what answers we got.\\nWho are Rey's Parents? - They were nobody\\, and they are dead\\, so who cares.\\nHow tall is Snoke? - Above average?\\nWho is Snoke? - Who cares he is dead.\\nHow did Snoke get those gnarly scars? - Who cares he is dead.\\nWhy did Kylo Ren turn to the dark side? - Cause Luke went Homicidal.\\nWhy did Luke run away? - Cause Luke went Homicidal.\\nAnd really those last two were the best answers we got in the movie. But to put it in perspective I am going to share a comic strip with you that someone else created. I had this shared with me but have been unable to find the creator\\, if that is you please let me know so I can give you credit.\\n \\nI mean seriously\\, this was the most compelling answer we could get\\, no wonder Mark Hamill said this is not his Luke Skywalker\\, for Luke to fail in such an epic manner\\, it just seems like bad storytelling to me\\, and completely out of character for someone who had supposedly reached the level of Jedi Master to allow Fear to consume him to such a great degree.\\nSo all those little threads that JJ Abrams gave us\\, gone burned away\\, and Luke seems\\, well not much like a Jedi Master. (Though I will give credit the running away and hiding is what they do. But then that was JJ Abrams who had him run away)\\nSo The Last Jedi has no interest in continuing on with any of the plot points from The Force Awakens\\, it continues the wholesale slaughter of anyone who was in the Original Trilogy\\, (ok this in and of itself is actually ok\\, the torch did need to be passed) But what are we left with?\\nWhen the movie began\\, the Resistance was in the midst of a battle for survival with the First Order\\, they spent 2.5 hours slowly running away\\, and by the end of the movie..... They were still running\\, just with a lot less of them.\\nSo what did happen? \\nPoe got demoted for not following orders\\, sure why not\\, you want to tear down one of the characters a little\\, show he has flaws\\, ok I can get behind that. Except why was he one of Leia's most trusted people in TFA if he is such a half cocked trigger happy flyboy now? If I recall he was sent on the all important mission to find Luke Skywalker in TFA..... But ok now he just lives to shoot stuff and his judgment is unreliable.\\nFinn\\, well it seems he is back to an unrelenting terror of everything first order\\,  not really a stretch but I would have hoped for some character growth not regression.\\nOh we met this new vice admiral Holdo\\, she has really neat pink hair and does not wear military uniforms. She also lack any leadership ability whatsoever and cant even include her senior officers in the planning for the survival of the resistance. But she does make a damn fine Kamikaze pilot.\\nRey goes off to get trained\\, so that should be good right? Except I don't think she ever gets trained\\, I mean she swing around a light saber\\, and Luke tells her why the Jedi must end..... wait no he tells her that he is going to tell her why\\, but then he never does....... Really he training can be summed up in Luke telling her why he ran away\\, really nothing happened there. Which is a shame too\\, because we had the voice of Alec Guinness\\, and Ewan McGregor giving her more help in the first movie.\\nSo really the movie boiled down to a slow chase\\, and Rose and Finn going on a date to a casino\\, where they got arrested immediately\\, but ended up saving the day. Yep in the end they freed all the slaves at that casino..... well all the animal slaves\\, the kids\\, they left them there to rot.\\nThe Last Jedi was 2.5 hours of not much happening at all\\, it was bright it was flashy\\, there were some really nicely shot scenes\\, but the story was non-existent beyond severing all ties with The Force Awakens\\, and there were absolutely no plot hooks to make you want to watch the next one aside from the fact that it will have Star Wars in the title.\\nHence why I would give this 1*out of 5. (Full disclosure I will buy this on Blu-Ray to be part of the collection even if in years to come I skip this movie to keep my star wars marathons a little shorter and more enjoyable)","true":true}
