{"101487":130304,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to rate this movie.  I give it one star.  This is the lowest possible score countable since RT does not factor in half stars to the audience score.\\n\\nI'm not going to go into too much depth about the horrendous nature of this movie\\, as that has been well-stated in countless audience reviews.  I will say though that Disney\/Lucasfilm has created the perfect defense mechanism to shield themselves from criticism.  By making all the actors of diverse backgrounds and genders\\, they can (and have and continue to) call you racist and sexist if you don't like this movie.  I'm sorry\\, Disney\/Lucasfilm\\, but *** you!  I didn't see a huge backlash to Ready Player One\\, where the main characters were white\\, black\\, and Asian men and women.  The reason: the characters were not token-ized\/marginalized and were well-written.  Disney's defense of diversity doesn't even stand up to scrutiny when you think about it.  Finn and Rose are the two token minority characters and are given a pointless side-mission just as something for them to do.  Finn is now set up to be involved with Rose\\, and Disney is backing down from the Finn\/Rey possible romance.  Because\\, God forbid\\, we can't have a black guy kiss a white girl in a major film release.  Disney's whole diversity agenda angle reeks of greed rather than a genuine interest in creating a well-written story where diversity is ancillary to the plot and setting.  And I'm not even getting started on their other ridiculous agenda-driven narratives dropped sloppily and blatantly into the story\\, such as veganism and animal rights.\\n\\nI am not a hater by nature\\, and have never hated a movie before the Last Jedi.  I have disliked movies\\, sure\\, because of a bad script\\, uninteresting characters\\, etc.  If the Last Jedi was just a poorly written\\, unimaginative\\, and derivative (ESB\/ROTJ all over this movie) mess\\, I would simply dislike this movie\\, as I do the Phantom Menace.  However\\, due to Disney\/Lucasfilm's clear prerogative to insert political and idiotic rhetoric\\, and Disney\/Lucasfilm continuing to insult fans who point out their hypocritical and greedy use of \\\"diversity\\\" to shield themselves from criticism\\, I absolutely HATE this movie.\\n\\nStar Wars is supposed to bring people together\\, not cause division and cause so much acrimony (trust me\\, I've seen almost every insult flown at either defenders or supporters of this film).  Even the prequels were not this hated.  I think it comes down to the fact that Lucas did not have any agendas other than trying to tell a good story.  While he may have gone a little far in merchandising characters (see Ewoks\\, which incidentally I love) and may have included subtle references to the Bush-era politics (see Padme's \\\"thunderous applause\\\" line)\\, the prequels did not go out of their way to tell you what to think and were not deliberately subversive for the hell of it.\\n\\nThe last thing I'll address is the writing in this movie and the sequel trilogy in general.  Star Wars is based upon the monomyth (see Wikipedia)\\, and that is a key reason for its universal appeal.  While derivative\\, Rey was set up in the Force Awakens to be the next Luke - the next hero to undergo the hero's journey.  However\\, Rian Johnson decided that he would scrap a timeless and universal mythological setup in lieu of artsy\\, subversive\\, liberal-leaning predilections in his script.  The latter is temporal and not timeless\\, and in my opinion is the reason that this movie is hated and will not stand the test of time.  Not to mention Rian Johnson's lack of understanding of the Star Wars mythology\/characters (see crazy Yoda; Luke almost murdering his teenage nephew Kylo despite going on a suicide mission to save the second most evil man in the universe; light-speed-ramming the enemy ship which destroys the whole point of the way the Death Stars were destroyed in Episodes IV and VI; and many\\, many\\, many\\, many\\, many more examples).\\n\\nI have plenty more to say about this atrocity of a film but I feel like I've rambled enough.","true":true}
