Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Joel deserved better \\, I don't mind him dying was kinda expecting it (I avoided all spoilers before playing this) could have sent him off in an epic way like protecting Ellie or how John Marston died. To top it off they made me play as Abby and no matter how hard they tried to humanize her it just didn't work for me I already knew Abby had her reasons to kill Joel with out them tryna explain it to me for 10 hours and trying to make her likeable they tried so hard to make Ellie seem like the bad guy killing the pregnant lady killing the dog etc but each time Ellie killed Abby's friend it was self defence and or she showed emotion\/regret where as Abby in that theatre scene was about to slit Deena's throat by while saying good despite knowing she is pregnant. And all the events in Jackson Seattle had no emotional toll on Abby she was happy dandy looking for fire flies where as Ellie was an emotional wreck and had PTSD. The lesson which naughtydog is tryna teach was revenge= bad thn why did it have the opposite effect on me where I wanted revenge till the end of the game and they couldn't even give me that\\, Joel wasn't avenged and Ellie lost everything.The last of us was my favorite game of all time this part 2 ruined it for me\u2026 Expand","true":true}
