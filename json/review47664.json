Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Batman v. Superman came out and people (including friends) trashed it\\, I went into the movie with very low expectations and was more than pleasantly surprised. I really\\, really\\, really hoped the same thing would happen when I went to see this movie. Alas\\, it did not.  Not only was this a bad Star Wars movie\\, this was just a plain bad movie.  Even my wife (who is not a Star Wars fan in the least) agreed. \\nI would be remiss not to say that the movie is quite visually stunning.  I can't argue that Rian Johnson knows how to compose a shot\\, but the story writing\\, comedic timing\\, character development\\, and universe building in this movie is about on-par with maybe the Green Lantern movie.  \\nI actually place this in the category of movies I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on seeing.","true":true}
