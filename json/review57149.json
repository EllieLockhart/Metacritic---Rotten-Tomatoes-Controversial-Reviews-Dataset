Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars.  I was apprehensive\\, yet hopeful when Disney bought Star Wars.  I was concerned about how they would handle Luke's character.  My greatest fear came true.  The Last Jedi managed to not only destroy Luke's character\\, but it also managed to destroy the Star Wars saga and its future.  I will continue to enjoy the original trilogy\\, but will never again watch a Disney Star Wars film or buy their products.","true":true}
