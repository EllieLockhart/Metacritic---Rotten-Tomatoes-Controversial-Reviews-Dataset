Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars film would have been much better if it was an hour or so shorter. Many unnecessary and uninspired characters. Almost no plot or character development outside of Kyle Ren and Rey a little bit. The only redeeming quality is the action and the visuals but that\u2019s the same positives as the prequels. JJ needs to come in and save this trilogy before it\u2019s too late.","true":true}
