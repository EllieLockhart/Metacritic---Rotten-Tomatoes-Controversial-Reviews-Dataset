Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has terrible character development and a pointless plot. The movie destroyed the character of luke skywalker and didnt progress the story in any way. It feels like star wars has been replaced by a made for tv movie on the lifetime channel.  I didnt pay to see solo and im not planning to see episode 9 unless lucasfilm and disney can stop attacking the fans for not liking this garbage movie. If ryan johnson makes another star wars movie im burning my star wars collection and never spending another dime on the star wars brand. Please hire sombody at lucasfilm\\nThat is an actual star was fan and is not trying to push a political agenda.","true":true}
