Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed at the decision to kill Luke\\, disregard Reys family and Kill snoke. Self absorbed director trying to make a name for himself. Bad move. Not cool. Just trying to go against the grain. What the heck were you thinking Rian? Sad day for Star wars.","true":true}
