Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve seen the movie twice already. I was caught up in the excitement and felt I had to like it. I saw it again\\, and it filled in some holes. I didn\u2019t hate it.\\, however\\, since seeing it I just feel sad. These characters that I\u2019ve grown up with\\, particularly Luke\\, were not handled with the care they deserve. It\u2019s like going to a restaurant everyone has been raving about and coming out thinking\\, \u201cmeh\u201d\\, that was just ok. ","true":true}
