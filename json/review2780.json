Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Messy. Long. Too many plots and they all lead to nowhere. Full of thematic promise but it barely scratches the surface. The lightsaber battles and space battles are boring and I\u2019m not entirely sure why Laura Dern is here.","true":true}
