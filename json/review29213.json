Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Repetition:  Impossible odds escape\\, and martydom to save the Rebellion.  A half hour shorter and it would have been less blatantly obvious this is just a Disney money machine now.  Galaxy does seem it would be better off\\, if the weepy Jedi were all exterminated.  If for no other reason than it would END the war this yin can't balance with it's yang.","true":true}
