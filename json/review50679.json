Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"8.0\/10\\n\\nWhile The Last Jedi would probably be in my bottom 3 as far as Star Wars movies go (real Star Wars movies\\, not spin offs\\, cartoons) it was not as nearly as bad as the angry nerds made it out to be. The first half of the movie was tedious\\, but the ending and the emergence of Rey made up for it.","true":true}
