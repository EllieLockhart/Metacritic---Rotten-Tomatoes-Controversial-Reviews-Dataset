Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trailers\\, hype\\, and youtube prediction videos ruin movies. We live in a time when predictable storylines have to be spoon fed to the dull masses in order to have fanboys to give their worthless mark of approval. Thankfully The Last Jedi does not fall into that category. Rian Johnson does a masterful job of telling a Star Wars story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing the whole time. The Last Jedi takes the story in a new and exciting direction while while respectfully paying homage to the classics and further developing iconic characters.","true":true}
