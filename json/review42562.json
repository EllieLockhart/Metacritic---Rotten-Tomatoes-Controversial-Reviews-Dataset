Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a slap in the face to Star Wars fans\\, movie critics are either not fans\\, on glue or being paid off the give this pile of crap the high ratings they have been giving it.  There is so much wrong with this movie I am not even interested to see where this franchise goes\\, this movie has killed Star Wars for me.","true":true}
