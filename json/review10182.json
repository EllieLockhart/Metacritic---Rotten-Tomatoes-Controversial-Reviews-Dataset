Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! Full of twists\\, turns and unexpected events. It felt like a mix between the old and the new Star Wars\\, and it was something completely different too. I love how ballsy the movie is and the fact that it takes a lot of risks\\, polemic ones\\, probably\\, but risks. Can't wait to see what they do with Episode 9. The dynamic between Kylo and Rey is fantastic (can't wait to see more of it) and also Mark and Carrie were absolutely GREAT. Awesome story. It makes you think about where the lines between good vs evil overlap. Kylo for the win! xD Go watch the movie with an open mind and you'll enjoy it.","true":true}
