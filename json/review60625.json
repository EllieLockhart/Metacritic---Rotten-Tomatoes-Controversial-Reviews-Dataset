Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Overall I really enjoyed the game. The story\\, while not perfect\\, was masterfully done and it evoked a deep level of compassion from me for both main characters. It forced me to empathize with someone that I REALLY didn't want to empathize with. I eventually really came to like the Abby character\\, though I wouldn't go as far as to say that I accepted her. And I would say for good reason.\r\rI had to sit back for a few days and really take it all in before I even deigned to form a final opinion on the game and while I felt cheated when the credits rolled\\, I came to really appreciate the story upon further contemplation. It's a story about love\\, loss and redemption. It's a story that makes you face the harsh realities of how it's like to go through the things that the MC's went through and what hatred and obsession can do to your psyche. It's a great game.\rThere were some things that I did not see the point to and it annoyed me a little since it felt like it could easily have been told in a different way and it would've told the same story\\, but it didn't detract from the story in it's entirety and I really appreciated all the characters.\r\rFrom technical aspect\\, this game deserves almost full marks. The visuals are gorgeous and the sound design is phenomenal. There were small things that I picked up that were a little off but it didn't detract from the amazing job that the people at ND did. Well done.\r\rCan't wait to play this game again after some time away from the game. I really want to sit down and try to understand and look deeper into the motivations of the characters and how it all ties together. That alone tells me that it's a good game. It makes you think. It makes you really sit down and have an internal debate to evaluate what you think and why you think it. I'm generally a one and done pony.\r\rI do feel like the pacing in the story was a little off and that some scenes could have contributed to a more comprehensive story overall\\, if it were played at different times. That's mainly where my gripes lie. All the elements for a great story is there and had it played out in a bit of a different order I think it could have done a better job. Not that it didn't do a really good job regardless.\r\rWould I recommend this game to friends? Definitely. But only if I know they have the ability to really sit down and think and deliberate about what they see.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
