Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had a blast and was really surprised by how far this movie went. There were a few points where it kinda dragged\\, and some ideas weren't executed as well as they could have been. Despite those moments\\, it was still a thoroughly enjoyable film. Nothing happened that is worth all this hate its getting\\, so please don't send death threats to the director or the cast. There is no movie in the world that is that bad.","true":true}
