Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, did all these people watch the same movie I did\\, because what I saw was a mess. Entire story plots thrown away\\, characters that where thrown away and an entire section of the film that just didn't belong there. All style and no substance.","true":true}
