Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. They turned my childhood hero Luke Skywalker into a quitter who gets drunk on green milk. We're talking about a Jedi Knight who saw a sliver of good in Darth Vader and went against reason in trying to redeem him. To have Luke then pull a lightsaber on his sleeping nephew based on a fleeting vision that he would become evil is beyond absurd. I missed that part of the Jedi code about killing people in their sleep\\, and Luke's nephew no less. Did the writers of this movie not understand the character of Luke Skywalker? \\n\\nThere are so many other problems with this movie that a 10 page essay would be required to explore them all. As a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, I do not think I will see another Star Wars movie at a theater. I created a Rotten Tomatoes account only to criticize this travesty of a Star Wars movie (which is saying a lot considering the prequels).","true":true}
