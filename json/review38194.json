Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The truth is...it\u2019s just average. .. and we want SOOO much more from this iconic franchise. So when there\u2019s an average movie when we\u2019ve experienced epic\\, it feels like an abomination. It makes light of its situation WAAAAYYY too much\\, it\u2019s not a comedy...if the originals would\u2019ve done that\\, they\u2019d have been average too. I hate ep 1-3\\, but at least they didn\u2019t gag every minute..throw some 4th wall in\\, and we\u2019ve got space balls. ...It\u2019s definitely not on par with today\u2019s action standards. It needed to be heavier\\, sharper\\, and more challenging to the viewer. Are we concerned about 6 year olds understanding every detail bc they\u2019re purchasing the merch?? Needed more weight\\, like Wars and Empire had\\, and fell utterly short. You end up caring about no one\\, really.. Diversity is needed. It\u2019s time... it\u2019s way past time..but cmon- don\u2019t put in characters to kill them off for the sake of a \u201cstatus quo\u201d..no one benefits..WRITE A GOOD SCREENPLAy...i will hesitate to see next movie until I see positive fan reviews.
