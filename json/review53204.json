Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie with great acting\\, some of the best scenes that will go down in Star Wars history\\, the movie was dragged down by the subplot in the movie\\, which I enjoyed but it slowed down the movie. Some of the humor felt out of place but I didn\u2019t mind it to much. The parts of this movie that I love the most are the scenes with Rey and Luke. There characters collide at first but become more as a mentor relationship. As a whole I love this movie.","true":true}
