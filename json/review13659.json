Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give this movie less than half a star\\, I would. Essentially every character in this movie was  handled poorly to an extreme epic in proportion. Rey is a halfwit\\, dumbass\\, bumbling idiot\\, who wonders about  aimlessly just doing whatever. There are sequences in this movie that are entirely unnecessary and a waste of the time of any viewer.  I cannot think of less necessary characters than Holdo\\, Rose and Phasma\\,  and they are supposed to be among the main characters.  The only thing about this movie that is not an a  complete waste of potential is the special effects.   I dont watch a movie soley for the effects\\,  but also for a good story\\,  and a good story is clearly lacking in this film.   This is not Star Wars\\, this is bullshit.","true":true}
