Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute rubbish. I've liked every starwars movie up until this one\\, but I hated it. I felt nothing when the end credits rolled up on the screen\\, I felt empty walking out of the cinema. I can say I've never had that happen before.\\n\\nEvery direction the movie went felt like it was the wrong choice. They threw the character of Luke Skywalker under the bus\\, such a cop out how they made him bow out of the story.","true":true}
