Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was a major disappointment.  The most hopeful guy in the galaxy-that saved one of the worst humans to ever live\\, because he saw the good in him-can't see the good in himself.  He's in a deeply depressed stupor.  It is clear that the original heroes were only in this trilogy to bring the old fans along.\\n\\nCharacters that have almost no bearing on the outcome of TLJ:\\nLuke ****** Skywalker\\nFinn\\,\\nRose\\,\\nSnoke\\,\\nGeneral Hux\\,\\nPhasma\\,\\nLeia\\,\\nPoe -- never really does anything that isn't a total eff up\\n\\nThings that were in TFA that were never even mentioned in 8:\\nWho Snoke is?\\nWhere the First Order came from?\\nWhy Rey had force visions of Luke when holding his lightsaber?\\nHow did Maz get Luke's lightsaber in the first place?\\nWho are the Knights of Ren?\\nWhy aren't their any Knights of Ren around still?\\nWhy should anyone care about Phasma?","true":true}
