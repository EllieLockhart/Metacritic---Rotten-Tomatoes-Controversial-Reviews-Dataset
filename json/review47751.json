Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When reviewing Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, it is hard to know where to begin. In what is Rian Johnson's first and hopefully last outing into the Star Wars universe\\, the force not only seems to be not with this installment\\, but rather to have completely abandoned it. \\n\\nFrom the overuse of cheesy sci fi-channel esque dialogue to the breaking of the rules of the Star Wars universe. (Hyperspace communication and tracking\\, anyone?)\\, the ignorance of the Star Wars universe is easily one of the SMALLEST issues with this movie.\\n\\nIt is obvious from one viewing that this film wants to be unpredictable. And badly. It wants it so badly\\, that it's willing to sacrifice comprehensible plot\\, beloved characters\\, and believable storylines to get them.\\n\\nFrom the botched handling of Leia and Luke\\, to the rapidly rushed storylines of Rey and Kylo\\, to the wasted and unexplained deaths of Snoke and Luke\\, to the absolutely disappointing backstory reveal of Rey\\, and the incomprehensible way it is delivered\\, The Last Jedi is a tangled mess from start to finish. \\n\\nWasted characters and plotlines abound\\, from 30 minutes of time devoted to Finn's romantic attachment to a character noone will remember\\, to Rey's much anticipated training scenes botched and boiled down to less than 10 minutes of screentime\\, to Leia surviving with no reason to. From Rey's sudden change in motivation after 3 conversations without any change in Kylo to usher it in\\, and all capped off with the giant middle finger that was Luke's death of exhaustion\\, after a 10 second light saber battle that will surely go down in history as the worst ever put to film. Not since Padme's death of sadness has a death in the Star Wars universe been so poorly handled.  \\n\\nThe film attempts to bring the audience to the brink of despair\\, and it does that well\\, but in more ways than it intended. It manages to bring you to the brink of despair\\, expecting the rebels will never win\\, that this is the end. But as the end approaches\\, and Lukes return heralds the beginning of a new dawn\\, rather than feel the surge of the light and return of hope\\, one only feels the dismal end of a series that filled people with wonder for over 30 years. \\n\\nThe best comment one could end on\\, is provided right there in the film. As Luke\\, in a fit of rage over his life and the way things have turned out\\, charges a tree full of the histories and lore of the star wars universe\\, prepared to burn it down\\, Yoda instead (as a spirit) calls forth the power of lightning\\, striking the tree and burning it down before he has the chance. \\n\\nDisney calls forth its true colors at this moment\\, summoning the imagery of a Star Wars book burning forth in one cruel\\, heartless stab to the chest of any true Star Wars fan\\, as they showcase not only a moment of moving on and letting go of the past for Luke\\, but a demonstration of their respect for the Universe they now caretake- none at all. \\n\\nThis film has ended my hope for the series. I wish i could say it hadn't. It breaks my heart\\, and Mark Hamill\\, you deserved so much better than this. To the all the fans- May the force be with you.","true":true}
