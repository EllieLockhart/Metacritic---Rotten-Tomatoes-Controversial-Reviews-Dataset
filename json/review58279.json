Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely breathtaking acting in this film from the whole cast. Fantastic visuals as well and John Williams once again reasserts his dominance as the premier cinema score writer. Deserving of Certified Fresh indeed. A quick note to anyone still debating whether to see this move\\, people only rated this movie so low because none of the Star Wars fan theories were confirmed in it. This movie is good. It was just rated poorly by angry Star Wars \\\"fans\\\"","true":true}
