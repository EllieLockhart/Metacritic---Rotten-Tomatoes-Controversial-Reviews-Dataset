Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what is with all the misdirects and killing off the supreme leader with a \\\"bait and switch\\\" move. Then making the movie the most funniest Star Wars movie to date? Really not what I expected. Rian Johnson should take some advice from Gareth Edwards or JJ Abrams on how to have a smooth story flow and not make it look like he intentionally wanted to trick everyone with all these misdirects creating massive plot holes with no real desire to see episode IV.","true":true}
