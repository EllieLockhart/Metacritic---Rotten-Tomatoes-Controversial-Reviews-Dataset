Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get why people think this movie is the wrong sequel to TFA.  But I have to disagree.  I have always felt that the Force is much bigger than Anakin\\, Luke and co and that Lucas was always trying to tell us that the Jedi are only caretakers while they are around.  This movie solidifies that notion.  Its bigger than Luke and even Rey and that those that have the ability have to decide how they are going to use it (like Good Cop\/Bad Cop). TFA had to pander to the original trilogy fans just to get everyone excited again.  And it did that by basically recreating A New Hope.  But TLJ had the open canvas to go in another direction and I think that makes the whole universe better.  I'm willing and able to see the new trilogy as a new chance and let the anthology series movies stay rooted in the old school.","true":true}
