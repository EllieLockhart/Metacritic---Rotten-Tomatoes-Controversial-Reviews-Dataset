Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would truly say disappointing and Star Wars in the same sentence\\, but the time has arrived. It had a few disappointments with Rey and Snoke. I felt lead on from here from The Force Awakens. I felt more could have been done to make the storyline better.","true":true}
