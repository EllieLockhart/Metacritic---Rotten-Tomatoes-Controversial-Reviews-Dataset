{"101487":106177,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As you can see\\, I'm very disappointed in the movie and I can't understand why some consider it brings change. Grey areas? Really? It could have been\\, but in the end\\, it wasn't. Good characters? There was no time to develop them. Except perhaps Kylo and Poe a bit. Rey\\, Leia\\, Dern and Rose are there for the men\\, for the men stories\\, to make them evolve\\, change. Not there for themselves I'm afraid. To burn things to the ground and start anew you don't need to step on the ashes and dishonor them. What they have done with some characters is awful. Admiral Ackbar? Leia? Luke? It feels more the last movie in a trilogy than the second. The movie itself is good\\, with cool visuals\\, nice planets and shots\\, good acting and action scenes. There are some very good scenes\\, that I can even consider some of the best in SW. However\\, overall\\, the pace is wrong\\, there are forced plots for the sake of something that escapes me (Benicio?) and too many plotholes to maintain the suspension of disbelief (autopilot anyone?). And finally\\, perhaps the worst of all for me... there is no emotion. All emotional scenes are cut\\, mangled\\, broken. The movie finishes and I felt mostly nothing. Except for a brief moment when I thought that the grey was possible... then it was all gone. Also\\, making \\\"funny\\\" jokes in nearly all the scenes destroys the emotional buildup. So\\, to be clear. I don't mind the interpretation of the Force. That was on the table since Empire\\, and in fact\\, Force Awakens already hinted on that. Otherwise why do you think there were many apprentices? (by the way\\, where are they? Aren't they the Knights of Ren? How cool a group of Sith would have been.... snif snif\\, another lost chance at real change). So\\, I don't mind that they go for the grey\\, actually that's really what I wanted\\, but it did not happen\\, really. Otherwise\\, check the ending again\\, how many sides there are?\\nSo\\, to be even more clear\\, it's not the what that's my problem with this movie. It's the how.\\nTo me\\, it seems that the director was intent in destroying fan theories\\, instead on telling a story. I don't think fans would have minded if he did tell a different story that was expected. But it seems to me that his movie evolves on making every plot set up in the first disappear. Every single one of them: Who is Snoke?Who is Rey? What happened with Luke? Everything is tossed to the side with irreverence. Irreverence was unnecessary\\, as he did not construct anything out of it. And if people criticized Force Awakens for paying homage to the previous...well\\, this one was also copying a lot of images\\, especially in the last 20-25 minutes. And finally\\, another comment that has to be said. It seems that we are in the time of selling toys. The overpowered BB8 (good god!)\\, the ring\\, a new droid that does... very little.\\nJust to make sure\\, as a movie\\, it's a good movie for its visuals and the acting. But then again it's a bad movie due to the numerous plotholes and lack of story telling. As another review indicates \\\"Subversion for its own sake isn't art. If the result isn't glorious then it's just trolling. The combined narrative choices in TFA & TLJ aren't glorious\\, they are pathetic. They aren't gloriously pathetic. They are just meh.\\\"  Some plotholes and the usual plot licenses that I can usually disregard (time management\\, technicalities\\, etc) were hightened because I was thrown out of the movie nearly constantly due the obvious disregard for the legacy (the director wanted to make it especially obvious to us)\\, the excessive funny moments\\, and the general lack of emotion and empathy with the characters. So\\, to me\\, as a Star Wars movie\\, it was a very mediocre and mishandled movie.","true":true}
