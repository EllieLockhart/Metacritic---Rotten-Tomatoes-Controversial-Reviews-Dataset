Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ultimately I really wanted to like this game but despite enjoying the gameplay which while outdated is still pretty good overall and only really begins to drag about half way through\\, I have to find myself agreeing with a lot of people on the story. Put simply the story did not satisfy me at all\\, watching Joel be killed in such a brutal manner even though he had done horrible things was pretty terrible in my opinion and overall going all the way through the game only to have Ellie spare Abby is pure garbage. Naughty Dog should have at least made the player choose whether to kill or spare her but instead the whole game feels empty for me after Ellie sparing her. I just despise that Ellie goes through so much and sacrifices so much and doesn't even kill the one person who actually killed Joel despite cutting people down like **** weeds for the whole story. TLDR a good solid 7.5 out of 10 which is dragged down to a 4 for me because of how disappointed I was by the end of it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
