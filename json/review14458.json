Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate being \\\"that starwars fan\\\" but this movie was so insanely disappointing. Everything The Force Awakens built up was ripped down and forgotten. How they handled old legendary characters (mainly Luke) was atrocious.  I hate that I hate it.","true":true}
