Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The half star is just for the audiovisual effects\\, which are good enough to be enjoyed\\, but only if you abandon physics & logic. This movie is more a conglomeration of plot holes than it is an actual story. And what fills those plot holes is a not-so-subtle politicization typical to current leftist Hollywood. The character motivations and decisions are 99% emotional\\, 1% strategic. There is no sensible military strategy in any battle\\, and it is especially lacking in space battles\\, given the advanced technology available to them. The allure of the original characters is taken advantage of: their virtues and vices are changed on a whim just to support a plot that cannot stand on its own in any fictional universe. Most of the newer characters are single-dimensional and do not make sense in the context of the larger mythos. Several pivotal moments ignore the physics of reality (dragging Le\u00eda into the hall from open space) and those established in previous Star Wars films (having a \\\"hyperspace\\\" jump where the ship doesn't actually go into the alternate dimension of hyperspace and thus wouldn't interact with a physical obstruction). Overall\\, the pacing feels inconsistent. Everything feels contrived\\, forced\\, cheap\\, convenient\\, or nonsensical. Basically\\, the conceptualization\\, writing\\, and directing all suck. Then the actors and post-production staff were forced to polish the turd. What a sham(e).","true":true}
