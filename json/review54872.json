Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a mad max film in space? no its star wars... no wait it isn't that either.  has more plot holes and pointless sequences than a block of swiss cheese.  No pay offs from the set ups made on characters from the previous film. does npt flow well. Masasive emphasis placed on female characters whilst male both new and old demasculated at every turn. What the hell happened to luke skywalker. an oportunity to create jedi fighting beyond amazing and you choose milking a sea cow and a disappearing force powers. These are not the olny issues. clearly the wrong inexperienced director for the job. Sorry Rian you are NOT A STAR WARS FAN you are a puppet of disney for making this in the way you did. There's way way way too much political messaging and too much clear interference from the powers above to drive home WHAT message??? awful and avoidable by an true star wars fan no attempt made to get us to buy into loving the characters. Never mind the millennium falcon\\, this is the biggest hunk of junk in the galaxy.\\n\\nHow the hell are they still employed. and how do the critics here give these dazzling scores\\,\\,\\,\\, paid off? worried about disney kickback. no way it should be 91% you 'the professionals' i dare you to go on a live stream and justify your 91%\/","true":true}
