Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very unhappy with this film. \\nThe plot was weak and nonsensical--a hot mess of explosions and casual killing of core characters. \\nThe characters were poorly developed and inconsistent with previous installments. The dialogue largely consisted of worn platitudes and mindless drivel. \\nThe humor was out of place and silly. \\nThe placement of adorable space-birds for the sole purpose of selling future toys and action-figures was mildly infuriating. \\nThe agendas of Disney and its absurd and transparent advocacy were cumbersome and detracted from the quality of the movie. (Yes\\, we understand that white pasty-faced men are the aggressors and purple-haired women are the noble saviors of the galaxy.)\\nA colossal waste of time and money. Do not see","true":true}
