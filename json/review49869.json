Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can be a SJW\\, welcome a more diverse cast\\, love strong female characters\\, be weary of white boys whining about losing the front-and-center of the Star Wars stage and STILL hate this movie. Very thin & predictable plot. Awful script that is\\, for the most part\\, poorly acted (though it's hard to tell because the script is that bad). Zero characterization so we don't get to know the new characters\\, spend any time with characters we already know\\, or understand how old characters we love (e.g.\\, Luke) changed into something unrecognizable. Not enough scenes with new beings for us to even understand what kinds of beings they are (like porgs). Thumbs up to Adam Driver for his performance. Thumbs up to the fabulous spaceships-on-fire scenes (even if fires like that can't exist in space). Thumbs up to showing the scene between Luke & Kylo Ren from 2 different perspectives. Otherwise? Watch this only to know what happens so you'll have the necessary background for the next movie in case it's better than this one.","true":true}
