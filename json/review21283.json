Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with decent expectations after TFA and was sorely disappointed. I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan so I didn't mind that Rian Johnson went in a new direction with this film; I just didn't like the direction. Things I did not like (SPOILERS\\, obviously):\\n-Leia flying through space: so she has force powers but she's never once used them in actual battle? pretty selfish if you ask me. also the whole sequence felt dumb\\n-Yoda appearing out of nowhere: this whole scene took me out of the movie\\n-The whole adventure to the casino didn't do it for me. I just wasn't interested. Also who was the man with the red lapel? Why was he so important? We'll never know.\\n-And then they run into Benicio del Toro. So Finn and Rose just happen to find an expert hacker RANDOMLY in their cell\\, and then later on when they're trapped on that cliff he just HAPPENS to pick them up in a ship he stole and then at some point between then and when they get to the new order ship he somehow finds a way to not only tip off phasma but work out a deal with her. this entire character only served to move the plot along\\, and deus ex machina is fine once or twice but this movie just took it to the extreme.\\n-We learned absolutely nothing about Snoke. No major reveal about his origin\\, no exploration of his character\\, and despite being one of the most powerful characters even seen in the Star Wars universe he dies so meekly.\\n-Kylo and Rey feel like they're just unequivocally bad and good (respectively) and there isn't enough exploration as to why Kylo was drawn to Snoke in the first place or why Rey is so fiercely loyal to the resistance when she pretty much just joined their cause.\\n-Luke should've died as soon as his fight with Kylo ended and he fell on the rock. Having him be alive and THEN die after it for what seemed like no reason ruined what was a fairly solid twist and sacrifice.\\n-It just felt kind of weird that Luke needed to spend all of Episode 5 training with Yoda to face Darth Vader (and he still lost) and yet with no training Rey is already super powerful. I'm not saying it doesn't make sense\\, it's just that her power feels unearned and it kind of cheapens the Force.\\n-there were so many times when BB8 saved the day that it just seemed he was there to make sure none of the main characters dies.\\n-Captain Phasma also died pretty quickly and barely played a role in this film\\nThe two main twists (Kylo kiling Snoke and Luke being a ghost) were pretty cool (even though Luke should've died right away) but the plot holes\\, gimmicks\\, and lack of real character growth (Kylo's still whiny\\, Poe just wants to shoot things\\, Rey is more powerful but is still just good because she is\\, etc.) really ruined the film. I never thought I'd say this after how horrible LOST was\\, but I glad JJ will be back for IX. His movie was more of a good reproduction of the original trilogy but I'd much rather have another one of those than this.","true":true}
