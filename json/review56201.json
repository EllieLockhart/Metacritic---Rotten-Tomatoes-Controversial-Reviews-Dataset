Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has always had humour but not on the level as TLJ has taken it. Cringy humour forced into almost every scene possible. Story line plot all over the place\\, no direction\\, key characters killed off without building any real depth and no real explanation as to how and why they are killed. Overall hugely disappointing.\\nIf i wanted comedy il go watch an Adam Sandler movie","true":true}
