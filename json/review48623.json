Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst cinematic experience of my life.  Might be good if you aren't a Star Wars fan-- but if you are it is just a giant middle-finger popping out of a steaming bowl of poop.  Every negative review here I 100% agree with","true":true}
