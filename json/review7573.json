Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every Star Wars fan should be insulted by this representation of the universe. Every value of the force has been squashed if you're a fan of the old movies watch them. Don't waste your money. As a Star Wars fan going in this movie was terrible. If you're not a Star Wars fan and just looking for a action flick this movie is still terrible. None of the fight scenes or well-choreographed the characters are all underdeveloped and the story is a absolute joke. The story reminds me of quests throwing it random characters for no reason at all.","true":true}
