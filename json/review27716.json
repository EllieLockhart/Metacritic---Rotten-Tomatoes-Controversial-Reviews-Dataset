Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are way too hard on this movie. Yes\\, it had stupid and pointless elements\\, and yes\\, it wasn't perfect\\, and yes\\, it sidelined important characters for no good reason . . . what was my point again? Oh\\, the movie isn't that bad\\, it's the middle movie in a trilogy\\, it's going to get reconnected\\, and some things are going to be changed. Rey's parents don't matter - yeah BS\\, they'll matter in the next movie. Snoke died for no reason - no\\, they replaced him with Kylo as the main villain. The diversity angle was stupid and pointless - not because they shouldn't be there\\, but because they were wasted. I really wanted to see character development for Fin\\, and he just didn't matter in this movie.","true":true}
