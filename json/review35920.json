Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is the worst Star Wars yet. The prequels had some bad acting and dialogue but were still watchable. This movie is filled with plot holes\\, ignores details from the force awakens and includes unecessary scenes that only add to the already painful length of the movie. The only quality that is redeeming about this movie is the visuals and music\\, beyond that it is not worth watching.","true":true}
