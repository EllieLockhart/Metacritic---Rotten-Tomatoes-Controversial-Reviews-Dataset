Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie shows the philosophical potential of Hollywood and the Star Wars franchise: The dialogues between the three protaginsts (Kylo Ren\\, Rey and Luke Skywalker) are thoughtful\\, displaying different points of view on the same topics. The old quote \\\"from a certain point of view\\\" finally makes sense. Rian Johnson's take on the \\\"Force\\\" is more than the boring black and white conflict we've seen more than seven times now\\, as he looks in the gray areas between the extreme positions of the Jedi and the Sith. The characters in this story have small\\, but believable arcs\\, which is a nice contrast to the poetic and nearly surreal action scenes. Of course there are space battles and lightsaber duels\\, but they never felt so magical and powerful before. Compared to the previous Episode VII this movie offers simple\\, but in second thought meaningful answers to the questions of lineage\\, power and motivations of the antagonists. \\nA downside is the enormous length due to a large subplot and several plot twists. Some new characters might not meet everyone's tastes\\, but they are designed to be unsympathetic on purpose. Except for Luke Skywalker\\, the focus of the movie is totally on the new characters\\, which could disappoint some hardcore fans of the original movies.","true":true}
