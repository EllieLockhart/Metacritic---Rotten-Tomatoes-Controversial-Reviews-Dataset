Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this movie but I don't!!! It's worse then the prequels and the force awakens. Lousy ship designs for the resistance\\, wasted vIllains in snoke and plasma\\, no real explanation of snoke\\, or Rey's parentage\\, hated the retread of the AT-ATs and worst of all the return of the greatest Jedi of all time was about thrilling as the death of Han Solo. There were so many plot holes and bad scenes. I can't do it anymore. I dont care if they make an episode 9 or 90\\, I won't watch it.  I'm done.","true":true}
