Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First ever review. It had great critic reviews and so subsequently disappointed me even more. I am not sure how Disney managed to ruin the franchise but the film was a complete waste of time. I ended up hating all the characters apart from Luke and I did not care if they lived or died.","true":true}
