Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was full of dull forced humor that didn't work and completely made a joke of both sides of the force. Terrible story lines that \\\"dead-ended\\\" or went nowhere. Not what I what I hoped they would do with the return of Luke. They turned his character into a seal milking laughing stock.","true":true}
