Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After two screenings in under twenty four hours\\, I can officially announce that The Last Jedi ranks up there as one of my favourite Star Wars films. This decision\\, however did not come quickly or naturally. I needed the second viewing to help digest the first. Unlike with The Force Awakens where we were introduced to some wonderful new characters while sticking to familiar territory\\, The Last Jedi takes us into bold new places. The curse of being a super fan like myself is the anticipation and expectations that come from years of wondering\\, theorizing and the deciphering the films that came before it. Director Rian Johnson took what all of us fans grew to believe and turned it on it's head. This boldness has split some in the fan community but I for one can't wait to see where this new direction takes us. I also look forward to the multiple screenings of The Last Jedi I have yet to experience which I'm sure will contribute to my growing love of this film.","true":true}
