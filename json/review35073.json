Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first that I saw it in the cinema I thought it has somewhat ok\\, parts of it didn't make any sense at all but sure.\\nRe-watched it for the first time in ages yesterday with my boyfriend and I was bored senseless when you know the \\\"twists\\\"  the whole thing is just mind-numbingly boring and gives the film almost nothing to look forward to\\, I was happy when it ended.","true":true}
