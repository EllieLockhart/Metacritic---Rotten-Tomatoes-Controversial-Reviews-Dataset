Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this movie\\, despite the obvious flaws and stupid quirky moments that people are hating on.  It refreshed the brand and created a stronger focus on the force and the greater galaxy rather than just the sovereignty of the Skywalker lineage.  I wish there had been more explanation into Snoke and the Praetorians\\, and greater attention to other details but these didn't get in the way of me enjoying this as part of the saga and a movie in it's own right.","true":true}
