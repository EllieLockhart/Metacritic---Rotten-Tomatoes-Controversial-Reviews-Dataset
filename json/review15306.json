Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally created an account on Flixster just to rate this movie a 0.5 Star. The amount of plot holes\\, cringeworthy moments\\, and unfunny attempts at humor makes me feel sorry for die-hard Star Wars fans. Luckily\\, I am not one. But as someone that enjoys a good movie despite the genre\\, I can tell you this isn\u2019t one. ","true":true}
