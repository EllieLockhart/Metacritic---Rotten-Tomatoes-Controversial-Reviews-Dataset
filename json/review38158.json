Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The themes of this movie: learning from failure and not being tied to the past\\, were not subtle. Sledgehammer to crack nuts. The fakeouts got old very quickly and undermined the strength of some scenes entirely. \\n\\nToo many unresolved plots get brushed under the carpet. There is little to no consideration for the impact this film will have on other stories that share this setting. The hyperjump kamikaze scene is a notable example. This is not a film that plays well with others.","true":true}
