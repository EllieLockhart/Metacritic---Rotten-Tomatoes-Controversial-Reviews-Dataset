Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How did we go from Rogue One which was a very good movie to this boring\\, pointless\\, and confusing mess? Adam Driver is worse than Hayden Christensen. This almost feels like a Star Wars parody but it's not that smart. It's just bad.","true":true}
