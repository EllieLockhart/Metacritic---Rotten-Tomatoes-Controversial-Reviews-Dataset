Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, I'm not a bot. \\n\\nSecond\\, this movie is both a visual and sound wonder\\, however\\, the writing is extremely poor and lazy with all characters making these really dumb decisions. Some characters were portrayed completely different of their previous interactions\\, thus making pointless all the journey and mysteries raised so far. It`s ok to take the series to a different route\\, but this movie has simply to wasted so much potential plots and characters for nothing. \\n\\nA lot of people who hated this film are offering some very valid points\\, so it's simply stupid to rule out the backlash as just \\\"fanboy rage\\\"\\, especially when these shared opinions are being given by a diverse array of people. \\n\\nI will not start a hate campaign on SW. I'm just going to give my opinion\\, say I'm disappointed and hope that I can enjoy the next movie - if I don't\\, I at least hope that others may enjoy it. \\n\\nCheers.","true":true}
