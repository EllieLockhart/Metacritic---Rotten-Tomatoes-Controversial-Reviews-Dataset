Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie last night. I felt that to be able to write a true review that was well thought out and not full of emotion I had to sleep on it. It was a very different Star Wars film that we\u2019ve seen in the past. The film pays homage to all the previous SW films from Episode 1 to The Force Awakens. I personally liked the film. While it\u2019s full of plot holes and some characters get taken out in a very cheap way\\, it has some good moments. The jokes are hit and miss. There are some sequences\\, like the whole sequence on Canto Bight could have been omitted. Overall\\, you need to see this movie and make up your own mind. ","true":true}
