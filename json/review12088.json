Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I almost walked out of this movie 4 times. Not because I'm a die hard Star Wars authentist\\, but because it was cheesy\\, confusing\\, poorly written etc. I stayed because I paid D-Box prices and I hoped it would get better. It didn't and my 13 year old and I spent most of the movie rolling our eyes and laughing out loud at the absurd directions the story took. Now the only Star Wars I'll be watching are episodes 4-7. I don't know how Disney can right this wrong.","true":true}
