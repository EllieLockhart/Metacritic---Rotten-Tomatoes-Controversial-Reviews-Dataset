Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are overacting to significant plot points. The movie was far superior to the prequels in a number of ways and deserves at least a 4\/5 review. If you are a hardcore Star Wars fan that lives and breathes Star Wars\\, you may be disappointed. If you love Star Wars\\, but you don't spend hours making up fan theories\\, you will probably love this movie. \\n\\nDon't listen to the crazy Star Wars fans complaining. They are just upset about change and plot points they couldn't predict. The movie is gorgeous\\, has character development\\, Fantastic moments of surprise\\, great fight sequences\\, great ship battles\\, and some fun new characters.","true":true}
