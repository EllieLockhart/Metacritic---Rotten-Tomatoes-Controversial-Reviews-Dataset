Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed The Last Jedi.  I don't have an essay to write\\, but it did feel like Star Wars to me\\, and I walked out excited to see what happens next.  The original trilogy has been put on a far higher pedestal than it deserves\\, and now these films suffer from overhyped expectations.  It was a good movie.  Plain and simple.","true":true}
