Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only Star Wars film I ever hated.  Wow\\, terrible.  Completely lacking in every way.  I don't go to the theater for Star Wars movies anymore despite it having been my favorite movie franchise.  This movie left me so dissatisfied and frustrated that I wish I could go back in time and unsee it.","true":true}
