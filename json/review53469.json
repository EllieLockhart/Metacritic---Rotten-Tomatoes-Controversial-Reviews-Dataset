Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DO NOT go into this movie with expectations or preconceived beliefs and you will LOVE this movie. The Last Jedi isn't written for you to jump up and cheer about. If you go in expecting anything\\, expect to have the same look on your face as Han Solo gave Rey when she bypassed the hyperdrive.The movie is showing you the Force and just how amazing it is\\, and really brings back the gritty\\, magical monks that the series spawned from. I completely understand why Mark Hamill didn't like the direction they were talking Luke\\, but I give him HUGE cudos for pulling off such an interesting older Luke. Is he damaged? Yeah. Is he still Luke? Most definitely. Rian Johnson did everything wrong in such a way as it made a masterpiece. \\n\\nI can also see why all these fan boys that are probably still having \\\"fun\\\" with the slave Leia pic are crying. But it's time to stop crying\\, children. This isn't Lucas's mass-marketed \\\"anything to make me riich!\\\" Star Wars. This is a m movie about a war in the stars with Jedi. If you can't handle the grown-up Star Wars\\, go back to watching Harry Potter.","true":true}
