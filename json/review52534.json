Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A huge disappointment only due to the fact that the critics were calling it the best Star Wars yet. There is no way anyone could have honestly thought that. It was not a bad movie\\, however\\, it is the worst one since the prequels. So many plot holes\\, and the scene with Leia.........just awful.","true":true}
