Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some significant pacing problems and a few repetitive scenes\\, the characterization and visuals and even the messages of this movie are top notch. Like the other 2nd films in the last two trilogies\\, The Last Jedi hits a semi-depressing tone\\, most apparent in Rey's training with Luke which like Luke's training with Yoda doesn't go the easy or fast way that we'd all like. The unevenness of Luke's training is addressed in his character in I think a really great way\\, showing that even though the old Rebellion won it didn't make everything magically okay for ever. I do think however\\, unlike with Empire\\, a concentration here was to always look forward to the light\\, which you saw a lot with Poe and Finn and Rose.","true":true}
