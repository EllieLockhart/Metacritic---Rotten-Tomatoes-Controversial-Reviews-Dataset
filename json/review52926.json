Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"an insult to the star wars franchise. If I wanted a dime a dozen blockbuster movie id see transformers. except those movies are actually more interesting then this slow spaceship race that features zero tension (atleast have some tie fighters threatening the ships or something) fails to expand upon the rich lore by REFUSING to advance the plot and characters in any meaningful way. Full of lazy writing that makes us question the characters motivations (Kylo's reason for going to the dark side and luke's DECISION to kill him are breezed over in a weak he said this she said this flashback) shoehorned yoda in the movie\\, cheesy jokes\\, cheesy action\\, cheesy everything\\, i wish it never existed.","true":true}
