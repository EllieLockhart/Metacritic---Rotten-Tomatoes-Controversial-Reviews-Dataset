Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers. Star Wars fan here\\, but my faith in the franchise is waning. I had purchased two sets of tickets and did not attend the second showing so that I would not have to waste an additional 2 1\/2 hours of my life. I cannot believe how badly this movie turned out with so many eyes on it. What is equally disturbing is the critic score on this site. There is clearly something wrong when your fan base is largely upset\\, but for some reason the professional movie reviewers see The Last Jedi as an acceptable film. It is not\\, and do not waste your money on it as I have. ","true":true}
