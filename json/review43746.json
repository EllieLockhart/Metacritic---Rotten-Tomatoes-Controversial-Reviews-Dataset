Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the Star Wars film that made me lose interest in the franchise.   It's never happened before with me.  For example\\, I really liked the first Matrix movie\\, the second one was ok\\, not as interesting\\, but it had more action\\, and then the third one was a stinker.  I still like the first one though\\, regardless how bad the third film was.  This isn't the case with TLJ\\, as even over a month later\\, I still don't want to watch any of the original trilogy.  \\nThey could have done a lot with Phasma\\, but she just get's her well-trained butt handed to her.  Finn was turned into a joke in the opening act.  I'm not going to bother to go on with complaints\\, but it's like the director choose to mishandle every character on purpose.","true":true}
