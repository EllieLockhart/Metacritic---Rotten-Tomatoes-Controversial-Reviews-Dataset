Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time watching this\\, I will filled with disappointment and Sith-like anger.  After a second viewing\\, it has basically become Episode I to me in that I have found a way to make peace with the film's flaws even if I'm not happy with them.  That said\\, George Lucas had every right to do whatever he wanted with his characters in his movies.  It's mind-boggling that Disney gave Ryan Johnson so much freedom to make a Ryan Johnson Star Wars movie and now we're forever stuck with the results of that decision.  Here's hoping that JJ Abrams will be able to salvage something from the mess Johnson has made.","true":true}
