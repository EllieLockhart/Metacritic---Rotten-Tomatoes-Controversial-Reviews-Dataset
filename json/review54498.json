Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED TLJ. It was a rip roaring good time. Brought back the magic to Star Wars. I liked The Force Awakens\\, but didn't like how much of the plot they repeated from A New Hope. This was ANYTHING but a repeat. It was Hollywood movie magic at its finest- lots of laughs\\, crying\\, and excitement to be had. And so much to look forward to! \\nThanks Disney\\, you don't disappoint\\, I know trust you with the Star Wars franchise- that's saying a lot. \\nLuke's character makes this movie for me. The whole vibe of the Force in this movie is...well\\, mystical and great. \\nThere were some flaws\\, but hey\\, its a sci-fi action movie. Oh yeah\\, did I mention this movie is FUCKING COOL?! \\nDon't believe the audience score\\, bunch of upset teenagers and pissed off fanboys. \\nNegatives? There are some scenes that ran on too long\\, but the action makes up for it\\, especially the climax. But I'm rating 5\/5 to tilt the average. \\n\\nI'm really glad they had everything I hoped- epic standoffs\\, great space scenes\\, and most importantly\\, that spark of something NEW. I love New. And when I saw the ending- wow\\, I couldn't have been more shocked. The fact that they took risks like this as a studio makes me respect J.J Abrams more. Because the *definition* of The Force Awakens was risk free. \\nIf this pissed off people who are say\\, Marvel fans\\, and shook them from their complacency\\, well they will grow up. That's all- enjoy!","true":true}
