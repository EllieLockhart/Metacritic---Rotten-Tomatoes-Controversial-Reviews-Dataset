Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi) is a 2017 American epic space opera film written and directed by Rian Johnson. It is the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.\\nAfter a slowish beginning\\, it didn't take long for this movie to grab my attention. With a good mix of drama\\, tension\\, and depth\\, and a welcome return to humour reminiscent of the original trilogy\\, this episode of Star Wars has put the franchise back on track. I enjoyed the way it cut from scene to scene\\, and also the use of past characters and themes. Can't wait for the next movie in this sequel trilogy. \\nThe highest grossing film of 2017.","true":true}
