Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie exceeded my expectations in every way. If you are trying to decide if you should see this movie I would 100% say go see it!!! I was expecting to not like the film because I had read negative reviews\\, but it is now a favorite of mine.","true":true}
