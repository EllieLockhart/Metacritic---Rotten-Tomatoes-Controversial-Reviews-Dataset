Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was good in certain regards but really kills everything that makes Star Wars great. Honestly this is more of a filler movie to get the interest of new Star Wars fans instead of appeasing the true fans to the series. This particular episode reflects the wants of the director but not with the fans interest in mind. The Last Jedi is full of cliches\\, empty plots\\, forgettable villains\\, and one-dimensional characters. You should wait until this is out on DVD but maybe not actually buy it but instead watch via a service. Hopefully the next episode can fix some of the wrongs that this one has made. I will definitely set the bar lower going into the next Star Wars film.","true":true}
