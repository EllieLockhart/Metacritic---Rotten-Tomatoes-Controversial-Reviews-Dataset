Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is passable\\, but that's it. Far to often during the course of the film i found myself saying\\, \\\"How?!\\\" or\\, \\\"Why?!\\\" or even\\, \\\"Why didn't you do that 5 minutes ago?!\\\" Beyond that\\, the film seems to go out of it's way to deliberately ignore or shrug off questions and implications brought up by The Force Awakens\\, to the point where the film feels almost insulting to the viewer for wanting answers to those questions. The film even not-so-subtly makes fun of other Star Wars films while still trying to BE a Star Wars film\\, and the overall effect the viewer is left with is that the writers weren't taking the job seriously. Mind\\, the effects are great and the battle sequences are amazing\\, and I applaud the writers for trying to take things in a more realistic direction\\, such as Poe getting chewed out and demoted for being a cocky flyboy and causing trouble\\, but the way they went about it felt a little too insulting towards the earlier movies\\, where plans and actions similar to his are openly praised. All in all\\, this film seems to try too hard not to be a Star Wars film while still being a Star Wars film.","true":true}
