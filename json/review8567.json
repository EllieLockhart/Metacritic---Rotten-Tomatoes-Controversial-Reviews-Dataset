Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First my experience...first Star Wars movie...even first movie I watched in theatre that I really wanted to end. It was agony. So many money and nobody can make decent story ! I do not watch DC-Marvel-Transformers movies because I do not like no story and a lot of flashing in movie...and now Star Wars is the same. Abomination and Star Wars is finished for me. I only wait for first 6 episodes in 4K and the rest does not exist for me. Time for Star Wars to end...","true":true}
