My personal assessment is 10\/10 and I recommend that everyone start the game from start to finish\\, not paying attention to such trifles as lesbian relationships\\, which by the way is not news.  Yes\\, the game is tough\\, but it is filled with non-trivial decisions by scriptwriters.  Yes\\, perhaps many were waiting for a different story\\, including me.  But this story will amaze you in the very heart\\, will not leave you indifferent and make you think.  The combination of violence\\, cruelty and wonderful emotionally touching moments is really brilliant.  Ellie has matured and the game has matured with her\\, no wonder.  Elegant graphics\\, atmosphere\\, elaboration of locations\\, directing\\, good old gameplay ... all this really adds up to one of the highest quality games of the generation.  What are all the little things for the development of which we so loved the first part or Uncharted series.  The plot - many call it a weak spot\\, but in fact it is very strong and multifaceted\\, it just needs to be understood and felt.  And frankly\\, such a plot gave me a lot more emotions than if it were trivial and kind.  Emotions are just what it's worth playing games for.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
