Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apart for some pacing issues I absolutely loved this movie. A refreshing new take on a galaxy far far away and some risks that I found to be excellent make this one of my favorite Star Wars films. Excellent acting and directing and amazing lightsaber choreography. I fully intend on watching this film more than once","true":true}
