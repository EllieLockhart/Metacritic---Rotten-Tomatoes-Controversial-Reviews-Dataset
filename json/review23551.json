Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie! It has gotten me back into Star Wars since I-III was not my favorite. I have watched the movie several times\\, read the book and rewatched the force awakens again since watching the last Jedi. I can't wait for episode IX!","true":true}
