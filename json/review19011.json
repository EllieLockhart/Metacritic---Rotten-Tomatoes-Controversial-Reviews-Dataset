Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's disappointing that they were so desperate to prove they could move on from the original stars that they ruined an opportunity to make movies with one of the iconic movie heroes of the last 40 years\\, and simply make movies that are entertaining for the fans. Stop trying so hard to be unexpected and please critics.","true":true}
