The next 10 or so hours\\, the gameplay and story actual becomes very exciting and engaging\\, the pace climbs to what feels like the climax and then.. you are brought back and all that building fizzles away. For the next 10 hours of the game you are forced to push yourself through one of the most tedious character arks of any game i have ever played. All combat had zero anxiety or stress as there is no incentive to want to survive. By the end of it you are forced to destroy everything you cherished from the first game. After all that you have to experience the longest finales of any game (seriously think lord of the rings extended edition level of ending) only to be left with zero closure\\, zero replay value and a sad feeling of waste as the game managed to prove multiple times that it could have been great. I dont know if it was laziness or an attempt to be extra hipster but all i do know is after waiting 7 years for this\\, i wont be waiting a second for TLOU3\u2026 Expand","true":true}
