Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie twice. There were plot elements and characters that I was not certain about.  On the second viewing my opinions coalesced into a review format. If The Force Awakens (episode 7) was a type of palate cleanser\\, then The Last Jedi (episode 8) is a focused arrangement of the familiar.\\n\\nFor anyone new to or unfamiliar with the Star Wars series\\, that individual should at least watch\\, The Force Awakens. The more movies in this series that is known to the viewer the deeper the enjoyment of this film will be.\\n\\nThis Rian Johnson directed movie did shred many super-fan theories. I define a super-fan as someone who is invested in all canon (encompassing multiple novels\\, animated series and all movies). While certain changes surprised me\\, it did not lower my opinion of The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe score by John Williams helped define this movie as part of the Star Wars series. CGI and practical effects were well mixed which added to seeing these locations more vividly. There are several scenes (one involving an interplanetary Casablanca\/Las Vegas) that I would either elongate or shorten. A couple of the scenes with the Porgs\\, briefly took me out of the movie. However\\, the Porgs were never Jar-Jar bad. Future filmmakers\\, never send the comic relief to the Senate (a Star Wars prequel reference)\\, it hits too close to home to be amusing.\\n\\nImagine that The Last Jedi is renovated bridge\\, which takes the viewer from The Force Awakens to the future movie concluding this part of the Star Wars saga in episode 9. Enjoy it as a movie\\, not as doctrine.","true":true}
