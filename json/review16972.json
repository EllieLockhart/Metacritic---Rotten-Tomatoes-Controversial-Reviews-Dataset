Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I rarely agree with critics but they were right! Great movie! I expected to hate Luke based on all the reviews but I loved him! Great ride\\, exciting and a very good addition to the franchise. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next!","true":true}
