Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like it was written by a committee. Found myself not caring for any of the characters. The production seemed more concerned about ticking various politically correct boxes. Which is fine if those themes are properly integrated into the narrative\\, but in the case of The L.J. they seemed tacked-on and led to a disjointed narrative. Propaganda not art.","true":true}
