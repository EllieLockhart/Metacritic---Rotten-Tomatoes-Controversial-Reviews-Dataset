Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie crapped all over the legacy of our most beloved characters. What is the point of Snoke? He lives and dies with no backstory or reason. Who decided to turn Luke\\, the representation of hope\\, into a angry old man? Subvert our expectations? Thats not good enough! One bad even with Ben Solo would not do that to the good\\, hopeful\\, Luke. Finally does he just randomly regain hope at the end!? Not gradually...but just conveniently when he needs to. Also\\, he just assumes Kylo Ren is evil when the old Luke even believed in the goodness in Darth Vader. The movie would have still have done Luke justice if the movie had kept the theme of balance between good and evil if Luke had affirmed that if the Jedi disappear then the Sith will disappear too. but no! The whole theme of \\\"the past must die\\\" and \\\"the Jedi must end.\\\" Instead they build this up and are just like \\\"but hope.\\\"  Also Vice Admiral Holdo is written as such a shitty leader. Like\\, she ignores the worries of her followers\\, and withholds her plans in a time of crisis\\, and just thinks that people should just trust her\\, just 'cause. This movie looks great\\, and it's not hard to watch\\, but there are so many problems having to do with continuity with the past movies and just some real bad characters and character progression stories. Like why did they spend so much time in a Canto Casino? Like\\, why were the characters more concerned with the enslaved animals and hardly noticed the enslaved children caring for the animals. I don't want to be here all day\\, but I'll suffice it to say that if you loved the original trilogy and the mythology\\, don't watch\\, or prepare to have your favorite characters be twisted and changed until they're almost unrecognizable.","true":true}
