Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the most disappointing film of my life and that's coming out of being furious over the bad episode 4 remake that was the Force Awakens. Characters have been completely rewritten to fit some strange interpretation of the star wars galaxy and even after learning nothing about the state of the universe in 7 we get to the end of 8 and still know almost nothing about what's happened or is going on. Plot holes can be acceptable\\, but this galaxy seems like one major black hole for plot and my hopes and dreams for a good new trilogy. We lost the extended universe for this?","true":true}
