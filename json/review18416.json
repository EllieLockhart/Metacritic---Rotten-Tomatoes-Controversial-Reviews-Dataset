Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is an entertaining movie\\, that a family could enjoy with good characters and growth\\, but in terms of the overall fabric of the Star Wars universe does little to nothing to fill the gaps that the Force Awaken left. Gravity in Space\\, an ambiguous Galaxy state. It feels like Disney has more of a plan on how to make money instead of developing the Star Wars universe. ","true":true}
