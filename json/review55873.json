Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Read the other negative reviews. These are not from bots or rapid purists... this movie is beyond garbage.\\n\\nI'm no super dork or fan boy- I loved the characters of original Star Wars movies because they embodied the classical Campbellian 'Hero's Journey'. It wasn't the special effects or CGI\\, it was THE STORY. TLJ fails utterly in that regard.\\n\\nI was with a theater half full of all kinds of families\/people (tweens\\, Millennials\\, Gen Xers\\, boomers) of all ages for a Monday showing\\, and I can tell you that once the end credits finally rolled it was dead silent. No cheers. No applause. I'd never experienced that at the end of a Star Wars movie before. \\n\\nPerhaps that is no one could believe that what we just sat through was a Star Wars movie... or what plodding\\, sophomoric dumpster fire of canon-mocking\\, beloved character destroying\\, heavy-handed social justice warrior manifesto doodling that Disney had fooled us all into shelling out $15.00 for. \\n\\nIf you were fan of and alive to see the original movies (SW\\,ESB\\,RoTJ) in the theater\\, this movie made it very clear that you aren't the audience these 'movies' are made for any longer. If you expected an engaging\\, fun\\, well-rounded story or anything enticing that the trailers seemed to promise\\, you left sadly disappointed.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is the last Star Wars movie made by Disney I will ever see in the theater. \\n\\nI cant even begin to imagine what utter crap the Han Solo spin off will be. Perhaps he'll be gender fluid\\, go to White Male Privilege training classes and preach about communism... which would not surprise me in the least after watching TLJ.","true":true}
