Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a 9.5 movie in my opinion and from everyone else I've talked to.  Very well acted\\, good story line and one of the best battle scenes in Star Wars movie history as the Rebellion is escaping in space. Don't believe the low user reviews score.  It is widely know that this site has been flooded by inauthentic negative user reviews by one individual\\, using a bot account.  It is an electronic infiltration program that can be used to flood sites with negative hits 24\/7.  This is the case with the low The Last Jedi user scores.  Listen to the critics for this Stars Wars review\\, this movie is very good-excellent!","true":true}
