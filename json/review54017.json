Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot in good conscience give this movie anything greater than 1 star. I have no idea what happened with the writing or how you can mess things up so badly but Rian Johnson found a way. \\nThe plot was weak and stole too much from previous Star Wars movies (spaceship can't go to light speed and is being chased by the JV Empire\\, showdown with walkers and all the JV Rebels have is speeders to fight back). All the characters were completely miss handled. It was as though their development from previous films didn't matter\\, Luke and Yoda being the worst. I could go on and on but honestly the film is not worth the time and money I have already given it.\\nMaybe Disney could let the people at HISHE write the next film. It doesn't matter though I will not be seeing anymore Star Wars films.","true":true}
