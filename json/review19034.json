Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's embarrassing to watch a bunch of angry nerds pretend that they suddenly know anything at all about narrative or character development. The Last Jedi was an overwhelming triumph exactly because it departed from Star Wars stereotypes and completely discarded the trite set up in the previous film. Without a doubt\\, The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since Empire.","true":true}
