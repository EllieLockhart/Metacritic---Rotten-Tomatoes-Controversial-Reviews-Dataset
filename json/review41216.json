Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie hits all the right emotional beats for me. Has the epic feel that a Star Wars film should. Much like The Force Awakens was able to recreate a lot of the feeling of the original Star Wars (any rehashes many plot points)\\, this movie nails the melancholy tone and dark themes introduced in the Empire Strikes Back (without just stealing it's plot.) Takes the characters new places\\, is inventive with the plot but stays true to the series (unlike Rise of Skywalker.)","true":true}
