Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought I was watching space balls at times\\, followed by mission impossible\\, then casino royale. I will have to watch it again\\, from a child's perspective. Kids love pantomimes\\, and so should adults. Overall\\, the Last Jedi has the potential to become comedy gold\\, though in a galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
