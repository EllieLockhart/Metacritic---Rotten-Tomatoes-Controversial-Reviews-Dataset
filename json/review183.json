It\u2019s really good. The writing is great\\, the characters are mostly really interesting and well developed\\, the actual events of the plot make sense given the world it takes place in\\, and though it\u2019s almost never incredibly exciting plot wise I always wanted to see what was gonna happen next.\r\u2022The combat is the prevailing gameplay\u2022The story in this game is quite easily it\u2019s best part. It\u2019s really good. The writing is great\\, the characters are mostly really interesting and well developed\\, the actual events of the plot make sense given the world it takes place in\\, and though it\u2019s almost never incredibly exciting plot wise I always wanted to see what was gonna happen next.\r\u2022The combat is the prevailing gameplay system and it\u2019s... fine. It starts out much better than it ends up becoming. Eventually it\u2019s just tedious\\, and while it\u2019s still pretty flashy\\, it becomes boring to see the same things over and over. The ability trees do not add much of anything at all\\, frankly\\, and this is kinda surprising given how much is there. It just never feels much different. The fact that there are multiple styles of combat for each character is a very good thing\\, though\\, and it\u2019s commendable for sure. They do feel pretty unique from one another.  Boss battles are never great\\, except maybe the first? As I said it\u2019s kinda exciting at the start. I always loved the QTE moments and maybe that\u2019s what set them aside for me. The system for healing felt a bit off to me\\, where you consume items to replenish heat too. Idk how I haven\u2019t mentioned heat yet actually. It\u2019s basically just how effective you are and it\u2019s built up when you attack\\, taken away when you use heat moves. Heat moves are these things you can do when you got certain weapons or when you\u2019ve knocked someone down or are in a certain position idk there\u2019s a lot of times it\u2019s available. And they\u2019re fun. They get a bit dull over time using the same ones\\, but they\u2019re never not enjoyable to look at. The heat system is a little annoying though it can be frustrating to lose all your heat when having three bars is the most fun at all times.\r\u2022The substories vary greatly in my enjoyment. At the start they were fun. They took a while to get annoying\\, but they did. I didn\u2019t have much fun with them once I got through about half with each character. None of the situations are that interesting or exciting. The relationship building ones is kind of an interesting concept though and it\u2019s pulled off decently though I couldn\u2019t really care less for any of them.\r\u2022The businesses are both pretty well thought out\\, but they also get dull over time. By the end of both stories I just didn\u2019t care. But the systems for building up money with Kiryu is somewhat engaging\\, more at first\\, and the mini game for Majima\u2019s never turns bad. But doing it too much is certainly a bore.\r\u2022The world in this game does not impress me at all. It\u2019s not fun to look at\\, really\\, it\u2019s not fun to explore or run around\\, it\u2019s full of enemies who\u2019ll just attack you outta nowhere and you gotta do this little chase every time to get away from em but sometimes you\u2019ll just have to fight them if you mess up. Just not at all a part of the game I enjoyed. Not even from the start. And I have no clue why you can\u2019t fast travel to certain places like your businesses.\r\u2022The world is full of mini games and most are just ok. None are great\\, but they\u2019re a decent time. Except karaoke. That\u2019s always fun.\r\u2022The music is good when it\u2019s not the same track played over and over and over again.\r\u2022The game isn\u2019t astonishing to look at\\, but I never minded it. The actual cutscenes were something I always liked to watch\\, but the other dialogue stuff isn\u2019t that impressive. There are three kinds of dialogue in this game\\, and while the other two forms aren\u2019t bad\\, I always looked forward to the cutscenes.\r\u2022Even though it is Japanese\\, I enjoyed the voice acting in this.\r\rOverall: I really enjoyed myself for a lot of this game. All of the story\\, basically. But over time everything else became a bit too monotonous. I just didn\u2019t care to finish every single thing\\, because this game is long as hell. The combat occurs much too often\\, a lot of it does feel like filler\\, but this game is well written and interesting enough throughout that it kept me pulled in. For almost none of the time playing it did I want to be playing some other game. Near the end I was glad to be getting it finished\\, but that\u2019s the same for nearly every game I\u2019ve played.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
