Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"        There is a difference between looking cool and being a well developed film. The two are not mutually exclusive.  While action sequences are visually interesting\\, this movie suffers from a badly paced and uninteresting plot\\, with characters who lack complexity.  Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe have origins which could be expanded on to make more complex or relatable\\, and have interactions that show their values\\, flaws\\, and motivations.  However\\, by the end you couldn't care less about these people.  \\n         As a fan of the franchise\\, it's also hard to watch a movie with so much unnecessary (and poor) attempts at humor that undermine the tension and the potential epic feel of nearly every scene. Disney tried to turn this into a marvel film\\, but the franchise has a completely different tone to it.  Dialogue and plot matter here\\, and both are completely overlooked.  With lines like \\\"Where'd the crystal critters go?\\\"\\, and the childish insult \\\"Chrome dome\\\" by Finn alone (both extremely cringe-y in delivery)\\, how did the critic rating get so high? Visuals are good.  Acting is decent.  Directing and editing not great\\, but the writing is what kills this whole movie.  For similar issues (from a better movie)\\, see The Justice League.  \\n     People call this bold\\, but it's a sad attempt at a rehash of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\"\\, with a useless 30 minute casino sequence in the middle\\, multiple plot holes\\, and unfortunate retroactive continuity implications for the franchise.
