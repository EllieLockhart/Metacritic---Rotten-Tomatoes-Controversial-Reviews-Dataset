Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought that Star Wars: The Last Jedi took an interesting turn in saga and introduced several wonderful characters while making you love the ones from the last movie even more. It is full of splendid effects and set pieces that are sure to intrigue any audience. Although some scenes lack its signature magic\\, it brought new ideas into this series and developed characters beautifully while strengthening bonds between them and created new ones. It takes spectacular twists and turns and has complex and masterful action scenes.","true":true}
