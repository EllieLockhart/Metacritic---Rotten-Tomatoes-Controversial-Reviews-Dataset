Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it holds up. Much of the hatred simply comes up from nostalgic fans who simply disagree with a new storyline and the death of old characters that constituted part of their childhood. Kind of funny how many keep mentioning that the prequels are better than this one. Would had been interesting to see how the ratings would be if disney had never bought star wars...","true":true}
