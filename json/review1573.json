Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan of both movies and books\\, I found this episode terribly disappointing.    As many have already said\\, it has gigantic plot holes and terrible writing.  Explanations to how a neophyte force user can easily kill off master swordsman and trained force users not only go unexplained but are compounded on.  Major characters are killed off without developing their story.   Contrived side plots of having the First Order ships being unable to catch a rebel capital ship are just too ridiculous for words.  Or how a single fighter can take out all the turrets on a juggernaut- who writes this stuff?   I could go on and on- but suffice to say\\, this is the worst Star Wars movie ever!","true":true}
