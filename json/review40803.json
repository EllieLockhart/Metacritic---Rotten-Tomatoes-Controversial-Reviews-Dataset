Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie benefits greatly from being part of the Star Wars universe. Without that\\, I don't know if I would have given it a second star. Extremely plot-driven and contrived. Several moments where characters' decisions did not seem motivated and were there just to add a twist or set something up. Big questions about major characters were either left unanswered or with disappointing answers. And the cheese factor is real. More cringe-worthy moments than I can count. Definitely would put this one in the same class as Episodes 1 & 2. Except those at least had more purpose and more meaning with where the story was going. This one was just full of a whole lot of random. I will say that this did have some of the best creature cameos of all the movies. But it came at the expense of several odd attempts to inject comedy into the movie. The set design\\, cinematography\\, visual effects\\, and sound design were all top notch. But honestly\\, that is all par for the course when it comes to Star Wars. The Force Awakens wasn't the best\\, but it was a great update and good first step in the continuation of the series as far as setting up the story for the next two episodes. This was a step backwards\\, especially since Rogue One was so strong. Hopefully IX makes up for it.","true":true}
