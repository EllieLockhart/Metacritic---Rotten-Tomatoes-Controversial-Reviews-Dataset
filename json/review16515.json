Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m very torn about this movie. I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fans and I absolutely love....some parts of this movie. But.....I absolutely HATE some parts of this movie. I am glad and at the same time shameful that I was an accessory to suck bad film making. I want to buy the blu ray but I don\u2019t want to let them think that this is acceptable movie making. Ugh......I don\u2019t know what to do. #dobetter #cutoutstupidcharacters #stupidhorserace #stupidleiascene","true":true}
