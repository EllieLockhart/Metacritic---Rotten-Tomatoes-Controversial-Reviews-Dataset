Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching the movie and having time to process it I can really appreciate what it is. People are going to bash it and that's understandable but at the same time you need to realize things needed to change. Luke's story needed to end to progress and make the last one more about the relationship between Kylo and Rey. It is a very different Star Wars from what we're use too but a good change and something new.","true":true}
