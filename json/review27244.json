Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word to describe the Last Jedi and that word is disappointing. After coming off the force Awakens the film had lots of potential. JJ Abrams set up the film perfectly. As a Star Wars fan I was very upset and disappointed with the poor writing from director Rian Johnson. I will give credit though\\, the film is visually stunning to watch.","true":true}
