Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dared to watch the movie two times (yes bad decision) just to see details that i would have missed the first time.  I knew that the experience would be worse the second time and sure it was....Many many people have talked about the lack of congruence \\, horrible plots and boring characters.  But the sad thing is that Disney had the gold opportunity to create a masterpiece for the joy of hardcore and newbies fans alike.  But\\, what a waste.  It is shocking unbelievable that Disney is not creative enough to assemble a compelling\\, coherent and interesting story.  If I want to watch a movie with great special effects there are many choices around. But Star Wars is about a deep story in a science fiction framework imho.... so sad.....","true":true}
