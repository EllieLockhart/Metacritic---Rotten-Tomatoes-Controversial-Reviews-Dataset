Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is no longer Star Wars\\, but a movie that was meant to make a quick buck. It left a lot to be desired\\, I have no reason to anticipate the next one when the Skywalker legacy is passed on to a manchild brat. Why even bring back  Luke and disgrace his character like that. There's so many inconsistencies and dumb comic relief. Star Wars should have never been brought back by Disney\\, but keep milking the cow\\, it's bound to run dry soon enough.","true":true}
