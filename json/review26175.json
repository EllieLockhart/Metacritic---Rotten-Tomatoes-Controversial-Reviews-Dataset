Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"not star wars. detracts from plot setups from previous film. disrespectful from lore. main character has no depth and doesnt need training or stuggles. boring plot that doesnt serve any purpose to a trilogy. i could go on and on. jokes fails\\, luke wanitng to kill his nephew in his sleep yet wont kill his father that murded jedi and children. what a trash movie. also lightspeed to attack first order...why not do this to the death star?","true":true}
