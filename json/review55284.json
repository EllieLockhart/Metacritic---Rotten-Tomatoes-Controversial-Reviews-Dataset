Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the theater asking \\\"wtf was that?\\\"... saw a bunch of previews of shit movies before this\\, like the jurassic park III sequel\\, thinking \\\"thank god star wars isnt' like that\\\" but then wtf was this?! \\n\\nLike all the fanservice reboots nowadays\\, this movie had NO SUBSTANCE. The characters felt like knock-offs\\, its as if the creators gave no respect to the original trilogy or even Episode VII\\, which prompted theories and questions that fans have been waiting for TWO WHOLE YEARS to get the answer to. This movie accomplishes jack shit in terms of story\\, bends the usage of the force and the SW technology to fit the plot whenever needed\\, but the *worst* part about this movie: THE CHARACTERS. Finn and Kylo Ren were the two best new characters\\, but they totally ruined Finn in this movie by sticking him with shitty dialogue. It felt disjointed to have him care about helping Rey\\, but at the same time spending his part of the story (a totally useless arc that ended in nothing) with a brand new character who we're only meant to know through her crummy dialogue. Anyway\\, I'm sorry for all the fans of this franchise as well as the people like me who were hyped for two years only to be disappointed.","true":true}
