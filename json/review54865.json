Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a fantastic movie\\, it really is.  Sure\\, you're not going to get answers to Snoke and Rey's lineage is literally nothing\\, but that's fine.  The disappointments people experienced are born of the hype.  I'm glad we didn't have another boring Sith master\/apprentice dichotomy to suss out or for Rey's parents to be someone special.  It was a relief.  The movie sacrificed these pointless details for tempo\\, to its benefit.\\n\\nThese details are nothing compared to the boring Skywalker story arc though.  The movie was completely amazing until they wrote Skywalker out of the series.  And that's not to say I have any issue with that at all.  It's just the way they did it.  It was cheap and lazy.  \\n\\nIt's a solid movie that sinks itself with a mediocre plot device at the end.","true":true}
