Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Would someone explain to Rian Johnson that there isn't gravity in space? Or how space works at all? Can someone please tell him to watch the originals\\, or even just the previous movie ffs\\, of a series he is creating a continuation of? No consistancy within this movie\\, let alone the series.","true":true}
