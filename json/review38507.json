Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film. Very sad! If only the ended it with power couple Kylo & Rey! Not knowing if Rey will go to the Darkside or Kylo will turn good again. And Luke?! We waited 30 years for that?!! Crap! Very disappointed!","true":true}
