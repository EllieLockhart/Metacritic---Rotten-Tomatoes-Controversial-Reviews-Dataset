Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great movie \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2?\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 Different on and emotional level of what to expect on episode 9 this was more sensational on the emotional standard of Star Wars . Although it may seem us Star Wars fans was not expecting it. It was different for Rian Johnson to make it in a bold way . But not too bold . Can\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t wait for part 9 !!!!","true":true}
