Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you just want a fun blockbuster this is the movie for you but if you care at all for the star wars film's or the craters of the star wars universe  or just good movie's you will be disappointed.","true":true}
