Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Genuinely thought this could go down with one of the failed star wars film like episode 1 with jar jar binks. No relevance of the porgs despite being the best part of the film along with chewy trying to eat them. 2.5 hours of which could have been more of an action packed 1.5 hour film cuting which looked like the dating version of the force between Rey and Ben. Looks like they have tried to take the approach that MCU have taken\\, trying to make it funny and action packed which didn't seem to work as much following the departure of Han solo. Baring in mind I think the film was rushed and still could have been better\\, it had times in which you thought it was just a standard time waster like most big movie series trying to string you along for the last episode. If I say so myself I think they need to go back to JJ ABRAMS.","true":true}
