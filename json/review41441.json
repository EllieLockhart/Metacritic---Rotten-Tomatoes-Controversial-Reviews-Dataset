Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a satisfying entertainment experience\\, albeit one that comes at a price. There is little in the form of answers to questions from The Force Awakens and the plot is strikingly dull. That being said\\, there are intriguing elements such as Rey's journeys on Luke's planet and the snowy scene with Luke and Kylo. This was good\\, but I sincerely hope that the next movie answers questions and deals with plot sequences better\\, rather than forcing us into strange situations.","true":true}
