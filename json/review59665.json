Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Please\\, please\\, please\\, if you enjoyed the first game do not buy the second one. The last of us franchise was broken by this game... Good Parts of the game\\, the graphics are beautiful they\u2019re great\\, the soundtrack was good but needed a little more work. The details on the characters like the eye balls were incredible and the blood on the character when you kill someone. The gameplay was alright but out of date for this generation. But none of that impacts the story in any way. The story just completely bombed the game for me\\, the ending had me depressed\\, like what the **** happens afterwards\\, why did Ellie have to lose 2 fingers and lose the ability to play the guitar and why did Dina have to leave\\, what **** writing\\, That ending really annoyed me like what the **** we needed to have Abby die or Joel die at the end. Joel\u2019s death really pissed me off as well he shouldn\u2019t have died to a ****ing GOLF CLUB!!!!! He would never trust anyone like them. The story let me down and the last of us franchise is not the last of us without Joel and Ellie and we got about two hours of them together throughout the game also when playing as Abby it was so difficult to carry on because her character is just so terrible also you have to play as her for 10 hours and it is equivalent to doing chores for hours on end not doing what you want. This game would be like if Harry Potter said to Lord Voldemort after hunting him down and then finally getting there and then fighting him and then getting a memory of lily and James and then saying **** it you can go.  What a let down of 7 years of waiting. My Overall Rating would be a two just for the graphics and the soundtrack. You have to watch videos of Abby dying Over and over As they are so funny and because you reading this probably hate her too. This is a genuine review for me after playing it myself. Please save your money for Cyberpunk or Ghost of Tsushima.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
