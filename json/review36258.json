Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last star wars movie I'll ever see in theaters. plots are cut short and don't go anywhere. characters are shallow and have little to know backstory. just a very boring film with pretty colors.","true":true}
