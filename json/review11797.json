Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How many times can a handful of movies be reproduced poorly\\, over and over again? At least two\\, so far. This movie was as poorly written and acted as the last one. Basically\\, they took 4\\, 5 and 6 \\, made it more cliche' and predictable\\, Hitler-like and monotonous. I'm not sure what people like about these last two movies. They need to quit trying to reproduce what was good in a few of the movies and come up with something new. The acting was terrible\\, the graphics were terrible and the the comic relief was not funny at all. Don't waste the money and two hours of your life watching this one. Rent A New Hope\\, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and watch the best of what this franchise has ever had to offer.","true":true}
