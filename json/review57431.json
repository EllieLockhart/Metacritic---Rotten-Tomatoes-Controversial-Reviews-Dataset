Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awful and I don't believe the score that the pros gave it.  A 90% whilst the audience score is holding at 49%??  How can that be?\\n\\nThis movie was so disappointing in so many ways.  If you want to take this movie franchise in a whole new direction\\, why not just write something totally different?  You don't get to inherit this movie\\, its lore and characters and then shite on them.\\n\\nI disliked the explanation of Rey's origins.  I disliked what they did to Luke\\, character assassination comes to mind.  I disliked Leia's role.  I disliked the underused Captain Phasma.  I disliked Yoda\\, he seemed slightly unhinged.  \\n\\nI hated the jokes\\, they were out of place in this movie.  I hated Rose\\, she is a horribly annoying person who ruined any scene she was in.  I hated Snoke's demise\\, that was a big letdown.  I hated the flying Leia scene\\, this was so corny I laughed out loud.\\n\\nI will not see this a second time in the cinema\\, or even at home.  I am anxious (and not in a good way) about what they will ruin in the next episode.  RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
