Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Jenkins makes the bold move of restarting the series... in the 8th of 9 movies.  He mercilessly trolled the audience that invested time and thought into the plot of The Force Awakens and he didn't understand the characters.  I think the critical praise it's receiving is because the movie is objectively good.  It does all the things critics wanted to see\\, so they were backed into a corner of giving it a great score.  The problem is RJ relied way too heavily on the gimmick of \\\"subverting expectations\\\" instead of trying to tell a good cogent story that understoof its characters\\, its source materials and the concept of a story arc.  It's messy\\, it goes on way too long and the humor is shoe horned in so badly\\, a canned laughter track would have actually helped.  I wanted to like this movie so bad\\, but its just a sloppy mess.","true":true}
