Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan\\, I didn't enjoy this at all. Unconvincing villain in Kylo. Too perfect hero in Rey. The character of Luke Skywlaker was wasted and may as well have not been in the movie. Boring casino plot and 'space chase'. I'm glad some people liked it\\, but I don't get the hype at all. It felt wonky and slow. No interest in Rian Johnson's new trilogy. No interest in Ep IX after seeing this either.","true":true}
