Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good visual\\, sound and of course John Williams always make a great score. But the writing destroyed a lot a story tread that was set up in the previous film. Il also seem to want to destroyed the lore established by the 7 previous film. Some plot line seems totally pointless in the overall story of the film.  The caracther has almost no real devellopement except for a contrive romantic story line that is cringe worthy. Star Wars has always had a politcal message in it's undertone but never a star wars movies has ever been so overtly politacal and make the watching experience very ackward at time. Overall it is not a good star wars and it feel more like a end than a middle of a trilogy.","true":true}
