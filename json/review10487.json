Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great special effects\\, captivating scenes but overall the story is insulting to true fans Rian Johnson has taken the future of Star Wars to a terrible place wasted character potential and ruined past characters. I am afraid for what he will do will an entire trilogy and I feel bad for JJ Abrams who now has to clean us this mess left by Johnson.","true":true}
