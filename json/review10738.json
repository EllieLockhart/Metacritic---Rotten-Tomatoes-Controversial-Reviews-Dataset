Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half of the movie ended up being irrelevant and was just a time filler. They could have combined the force awakens and the last jedi and we could have seen all of the original cast and the new characters would have had more depth added to them. Instead\\, Mark Hamill got killed off in the lamest way possible (invulnerable hologram that disappeared) and the one person who should have had a farewell end (Carie Fisher) turned into Superman. In all the movie had lazy writing and tons of plot holes. It seems like all they cared about is making money off the audiance incstead of delivering a quality product.","true":true}
