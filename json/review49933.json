Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"you hurt me with this movie. Han Solo died for nothing\\, the Force Awakens meant nothing. In a series of masterfully made movies you came and gave us a shattered image of a future we don't want to happen. You can see the audience score. That isn't just the people the 10 people the media say are overreacting. That is the people who have the same burning passion for this series as me. We will not stand for what you have done. You killed our heroes just so you can make more profit on the new characters. I don't know whether I will ever buy Star Wars merchandise ever again. I feel like I would be spitting on the original trilogy if I did.","true":true}
