Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back\\, hands down. I saw Star Wars and ESB when they first came out and it was rough to see the series decay\\, first through the lame Return Of The Jedi and then through the dreadful prequels. The Force Awakens was a step in the right direction but too much a copy of the first film to truly excite me. But with The Last Jedi\\, my thirty five year wait for another Star Wars movie I could truly respect as a film is finally satisfied. Thank you Rian Johnson\\, and don't mind the haters. People were thrown by Empire too when it first came out.","true":true}
