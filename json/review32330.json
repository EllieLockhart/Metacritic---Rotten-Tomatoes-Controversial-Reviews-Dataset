Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars hasn't been good for years (with exception of Rogue One) - this film has killed the franchise for me.  Boring as - nothing happened in it\\, even if that nothing looked pretty\\, this had less story than the life of a march fly","true":true}
