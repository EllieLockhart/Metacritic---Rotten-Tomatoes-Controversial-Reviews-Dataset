Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My wife and I thought it was epic! Beautiful I'm every way. Some stupid jokes that kids may enjoy but only about 4-5. It later the foundation to the future of the franchise and to us that's a great thing.","true":true}
