Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst move I have ever seen. Totally ruined Star Wars. Everyone involved should be fired. Don't waste your money to see this. Anyone who claims to like it is either paid or has horrible taste. I wish I could give this negative stars for (1) Bad writing \/ stupid plot points (Rebels running out of gas; slow space chase; superman Leia; dumb casino subplot; lame Rose & Poe characters); (2) ruined all major characters (Snoke = Joke; Rey = God for no reason; Bizzaro opposite Luke; Kylo Ren still = Lame Anakin 2.0; Phasma wasted again); (3) too long\\, boring\\, & forced attempted humor; (4) no lightsaber fight; (5) social justice pandering; (6) not a Star Wars Movie. The entire movie can be summed by the scene with Luke Skywalker milking a Space Walrus. Ditch this pointless garbage.","true":true}
