Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is totally trash! None of the story lines from the last movie was ever expanded on\\, none of the characters has any actual development. This is what you get when you let to incompetent directors make a movie in a trilogy without a coherent outline. I only gove this an 1\/2 star because I can't give it anything lower. Honestly the movie rubber was way berrer an had a better plot.","true":true}
