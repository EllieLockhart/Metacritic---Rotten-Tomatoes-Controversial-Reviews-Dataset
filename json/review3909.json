Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boo. Deus Ex Machina much? What a great way to smack your audience in the face repeatedly with the message to ignore the entire universe of content that came before it in an attempt to justify taking a massive dump on the franchise because your director sucks. Bad form\\, Disney. Get Lucas to direct the next one\\, at least he will keep the plot holes to a minimum.","true":true}
