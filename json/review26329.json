Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst movie and has its moments... but the story just felt it had been reverse-engineered\\, the end supposedly justifying the awkward means.\\n\\nThis isn't a movie I'll be happy to watch multiple times over the years... they wanted the cinematic power of Empire but fell way short.  Great acting\\, effects\\, and the usual trappings... just a weak overall story and poor pacing.","true":true}
