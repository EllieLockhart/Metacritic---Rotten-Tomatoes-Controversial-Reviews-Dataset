Do not buy if you played the first game. Graphics\\, sound\\, level design\\, animations\\, all 10\/10.... gameplay is a strong 8\/10 with many dips thanks to the forced story that really makes you not want to finish the game\\, i have never played a story driven game that made me want to speed run just to reach the end. The game is good\\, the narrative is garbage.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
