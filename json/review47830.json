Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? I can see what Rian Johnson tried to do with the movie\\, but that doesn't work for a sequel\\, that doesn't work for a second movie in a trilogy\\, and it certainly doesn't work for an established saga\\, namely the saga of the Skywalker family\\, Anakin\/Darth Vader\\, Luke and Leia. It wouldn't even have worked if they had tryied to make Palpatine or Obi-wan Kanobi Rey's father\/grandfather. This is a saga of the Skywalkers.\\nNow on to a lot of themes as this is the attempt of RJ to introduce into the franchise - unsuccesfully I might add.\\nYou cannot introduce independent themes into a mainstream movie\\, even themse that were internally independent of each other. Lack of internal logic and coherence was massive. Lack of awareness of overall strategy and tactics was massive. The movie wasn't story-driven and the massive speciel effects and beautiful scenes cannot make up for the lack of story. Also the movie was full of tells instead of showings. We were told of Rey's parents\\, not shown. We were told of Rose's childhood\\, not shown. We were told of Rose's relationship with her sister\\, not shown. We were told of Purple Hair\\, not shown. We were told of Fin's backstory as a janitor\\, not shown.\\nSometimes there weren't even tells\\, so neither tells nor shows such as Phasma. How did she survive\\, why is she badass? Who was the thief? Why did Rose and Fin suddenly trust him? Why would he ever save them?\\nWe were told nothing of Skywalker\\, we we shown nothing about Skywalker\\, except the meaningless scene of Kylo Ren's childhood attack. Was that really all that was needed to make a powerful\\, optimistic jedi into a whiny\\, grumbling\\, dark man who can't even defeat an untrained Rey?\\nAnd then there is the Mary Sue. Oh\\, I really hate Mary Sues. They don't belong in serious movies. They only belong in fan fiction\\, which never gets published.\\nIf villains are so weak as portrayed in the movie\\, why even bother with villains? Where is the threat in the movie? Hux surely wasn't a threat\\, Kylo isn't a threat\\, and Snoke wasn't a threat. The biggest threat was then revealed to be secretly good (Purple Hair)\\, who suddenly liked the whiny pilot hero.","true":true}
