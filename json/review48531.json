Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wonderful! Saw it at a 1 am show AFTER an office Christmas party and it still captivated throughout the long running time. I don't understand the hate for this one--I thought it nicely balanced dramatic battle scenes with rewarding emotional beats\\, gave all the major players a bit to do and introduced some new and interesting characters\\, and some of the staging was beautifully operatic (that red room battle!). I am also a total Porg fan\\, in case that's a litmus test for anyone.","true":true}
