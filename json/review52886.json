Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A movie with so many potholes I cannot fathom how anyone can like it.  Seriously\\, characters go off on missions that have no impact on the film other than to stretch the time from an easy thirty minute feature to one way over two hours.  The way they treat Luke is horrid\\, Leia is barely in it for Carrie Fishers final film\\, and one General who is running the resistance could have ended half the drama of this film if she had just talked a little more about her plans yet\\, because of this stupid script which led to a stupid movie she stays silent for no reason and gets people killed.  We've gone from the \\\"Luke I am your Father\\,\\\" genius of Empire to a laughably bad Leia flying...actually flying...please\\, please\\, skip this movie after this weekend so it makes only 220 million and Disney reboots so we can get a Star Wars that is smart and fun rather then inane\\, silly\\, and so sloppily written the filmmakers believe we will endure Laura Dern and others showing up and doing nothing important simply because they're famous and we should be happy they stopped by for a cameo.  Terrible movie.","true":true}
