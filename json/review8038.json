Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fans have expectations of what something should be\\, and this movie didn't meet old star wars fans expectations. I liked it because I didn't have expectations going in\\, so my perception wasn't clouded by those expectations. I suggest watching it a second time a dropping the idea that it's going to be Empire Strikes Back because this is 2017.","true":true}
