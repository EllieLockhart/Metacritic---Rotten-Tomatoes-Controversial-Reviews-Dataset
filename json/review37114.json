Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about this shitfest was the old cunt sitting next to me who was snoring the whole time.  It was loud enough to drown out the feminist plot of this turd.  Worst movie I've ever seen at the theater.  This director has no penis.","true":true}
