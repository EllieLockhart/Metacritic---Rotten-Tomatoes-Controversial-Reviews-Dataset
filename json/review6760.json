Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the haters. The people who didn't like it don't understand the overall theme of the movie\\, or else they're nerds who think they know everything. Spoilers ahead: failure is the theme. Every character in this movie shows their flaws and every mission fails\\, but in the end there is hope. It's the same with The Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones. It was also fresh and exciting and the visuals stunning\\, and showed what balance in the force really means.","true":true}
