Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall the movie was \u201cok\u201d. If you\u2019re a fan you should see it. I feel like the entire sub plot was a total waste of time. There\u2019s the feeling The with each movie the vehicles get more ridiculous and antiquated. Much of the investing you\u2019ve done in the characters up to now will be wasted as none of them seem to really matter. Bipolar movie. Some cool scenes that really got me excited\\, and then ultimately let me down. I left the theatre not sure what to feel. I won\u2019t be going to see the midnight early showing of the next movie when it comes out\\, might wait a week or so or catch it on DVD.","true":true}
