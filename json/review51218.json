Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved this film\\, i can almost see peoples criticisms but they're shadowed by how fresh this movie felt for being the 8th in the saga. I feel like this is the strongest standalone film in the bunch and it was wonderfully inventive with the groundwork laid for it. Had everything i could ask for\\, it really brought back the crazy looking characters that littered the backgrounds of the original trilogy. I could've maybe asked for more scenes where rey felt like a real jedi student and not so beyond teaching but i also respect that direction because of how nuanced every other aspect of this movie was.","true":true}
