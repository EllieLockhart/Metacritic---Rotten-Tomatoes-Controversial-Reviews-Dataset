Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So unbelievably disappointed!! I was fuming when I left the theater. Terrible story line! So many plot holes! So many unrealistic situations! Little to no character development! It's as if the writers had no clue as to how the previous movies went and what the Star Wars legacy is. Beautiful Vivid scenes... that's the only redeeming quality. Too Disneyfied for a movie that's supposed to have dark undertones and at least some semblance of seriousness.","true":true}
