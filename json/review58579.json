The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Imagine criticizing a video game just because you feel like it\\, I only read reviews from people who after 10 minutes of playing gives a 0 for who knows what reason. People have no idea what's behind the development of a video game\\, and giving zero to such a game is proof of that. Let's start from the technical side of the game: simply flawless\\, very high quality gameplay\\, attention to detail never seen before in a video game\\, all to create a unique gaming experience. I see people complaining about the plot\\, it may not be at the level of the first title\\, for various reasons\\, such as the fact that it is no longer a novelty (often the sequel has a slightly flatter plot) or the fact that Naughty Dog has tried to insert a new main character\\, but seeing people complaining that there are holes in the plot or that it is all about revenge and that the actions of the characters do not make sense\\, is equivalent to not understanding  the topics covered by this title\\, nor have any idea how human beings think; because coincidentally behind these works there are studies by industry experts. The main theme is certainly revenge\\, but the evolution of the plot and the behavior of the charcaters contains a set of emotions that go far beyond simple revenge. The game is impeccable\\, whether you like it or not\\, but the quality of the product is undeniable\\, and i loved the gameplay and the story too\\, because you know what? that's exaclty how people would behave in such situation. A solid 10 for this masterpiece\\, Naughty Dog never misses a shot.\rPS: Oh yeah maybe people doesen't know that TLOU is the story of Ellie and not of Joel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
