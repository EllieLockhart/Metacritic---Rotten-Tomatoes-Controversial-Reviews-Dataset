Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, this sequel trilogy is making the prequel trilogy look pretty darn good. Too me\\, this crap was written by a feministic\\, ADHD-suffering writer that doesn't understand the importance of character development. Seriously\\, why add characters with huge mysterious backgrounds\\, build them up as if they're unbelievable special individuals\\, and then\\, poof\\, they're gone? This did not just happened once in the movie\\, but twice!\\n\\nAnd what the heck is with using the force to mind-screw people that are lightyears away? How about force-ghosts not being \\\"ghosts?\\\" Speaking of ghosts\\, this moving seems like it was written\/directed by the same people\/person who did the Ghostbusters reboot. Just like that movie\\, the \\\"new\\\" main characters lack chemistry\\, while the old ones should never had been a part of this project as the two newer movies (in chronological order) is ruining the end of Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nAs a fan of the Star Wars franchise\\, I really want to like the new movies\\, but where Rogue One succeeded and kick-arse\\, this trilogy is failing miserably. Right now\\, I could care less about Episode IX.\\n\\nI give it a 6\/10 only because of the action and special effects.","true":true}
