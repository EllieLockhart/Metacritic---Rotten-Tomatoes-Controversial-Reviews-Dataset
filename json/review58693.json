The setup makes it feel like a traditional tale of revenge with a clear hero and villain\\, but very quickly makes you question who's really the hero\\, or if anyone's really the \\\"good guy\\\" at the end of the day.Ultimately I ended up rooting for all the characters to somehow figure out a way to win\\, and I think it's really amazing that the story was able to pull that off.The gameplay felt solid; aiming\/shooting mechanics seemed improved a bit from the first game\\, although the looting system (largely the same as the first game) detracted from the story a bit. There were times when the story was conveying a sense of urgency that I needed to be somewhere\\, but I couldn't help searching every corner of an abandoned building looking for items I might need. I think it resulted in a balanced and fun combat system where I had to think about what weapons I might use in a certain encounter based on what I had\\, but a part of me wishes I could've focused on the story instead. There's a New Game +\\, and I'm considering playing through again with all my gear\\, but on a lower difficulty so I can experience the story without having to worry about looting as much.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
