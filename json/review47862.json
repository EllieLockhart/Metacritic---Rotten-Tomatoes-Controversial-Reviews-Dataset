Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to Start with this film....The Last jedi was an attempt by Rian Johnson to make a sequel to the force awakens (a film with its own share of problems but manages to be a good EXPERIENCE overall). I say attempt because this movie creates more problems than it solves. It manages to destroy any potential from the first film and instead has everything from useless scenes that should have been cut from the film and reshot to illogical reasoning on why certain decisions were made. The actions sequence were done well enough is the only redeeming quality to this film. Quite literally if you appreciate the original trilogy do not watch this if you liked george lucas's episodes 1-3 do not watch this film.  If have not seen episode 1-7 watch this film but even then IDK if you will like it.","true":true}
