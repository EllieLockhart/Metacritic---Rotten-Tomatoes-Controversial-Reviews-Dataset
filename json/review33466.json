Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. A movie that at once rehashes Empire Strikes Back (Dagobah\\, Hoth\\, Yoda etc.) while destroying the legacy of the Saga. The movie takes place over a couple of days for whatever reason\\, making the plot self-contained and utterly unimportant. Plot holes galore and a complete disregard for lore. Two and a half hours of torture. Notice how none of my complaints have anything to do with race or gender. Just stop trying to deflect criticism of this travesty.","true":true}
