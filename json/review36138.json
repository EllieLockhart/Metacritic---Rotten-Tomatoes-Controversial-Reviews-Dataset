Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was an incredible disappointment. There are a few great action scenes but the plot makes little to no sense. Several fruitless subplots exist only to conveniently put characters in certain locations for climactic showdowns that pack little to no emotional punch.\\nThere are moments of humor added to the film that may have worked in any other movie but did not match the tone of the preexisting Star Wars franchise. There is little to no character growth for anyone and once the film is over\\, the plot has barely moved an inch. The film ultimately feels like fan fiction come to life with a 200 million dollar budget.\\nThe Force Awakens was little more than a Mad Libs version of A New Hope but at least JJ Abrams was able to keep the tone and feel of a Star Wars film.","true":true}
