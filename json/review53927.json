Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge fan of Rian Johnson's earlier works\\, especially \\\"Brick\\\". However\\, this is a how-to in bad writing. Many plot points serve no purpose\\, such as the trope of withholding information. Dern's character has no reason not to be up front\\, and her role could've been filled by pre-existing character such as Ackbar\\, Finn and Rose's story serves no purpose\\,and the Casino very out of place. The humor and action sequences are spoon fed and lazy. Also Disney uses the same cookie cutter humor from their Marvel joke formula. Rey's training is one of the biggest missed opportunities\\, as it feels as her powers kind of just fall into place for her\\, whereas Luke's training in the original trilogy took several films and helped the audience feel the weight  and importance of his role in the rebellion. I do like all of the main characters\\, who are nicely developed with well-rounded backstories and motivations easily felt by the audience. \\n Often the creatures seem out of place as well\\, especially on Luke's planet\\, though these cutesy moments for the kids\\, have a purpose\\, toy sales. If you do your research\\, youll find out execs wanted more of BB8 as he was the #1 most puchased toy in 2015\\, so BB8's role is amped\\, leaving behind Chewbacca\\, C3P0 and R2D2\\, who each get literal seconds of screen-time\\, as their toys sold poorly in 2015. One of my largest complaints was the treatment of Luke's character. He persistently saw the good in Vader through the whole original trilogy\\, without even knowing he was related\\, so why would he be so quick to kill his own nephew\\, and only see the bad in him? His instincts about Vader were correct\\, why would he not see the good in his own nephew? Likely\\, he was written out of the film because Hamill has been so vocal in the media criticizing The Force Awakens and Disney as a company. Literally all of the choices made for this film felt like marketing choices and not creative ones.","true":true}
