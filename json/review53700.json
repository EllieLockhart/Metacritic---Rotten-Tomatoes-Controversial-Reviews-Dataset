Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun at times but mostly annoying Marvel hero movie style jokes and some surprisingly flippant dismissal of characters and plot points everyone perceived as important in Force Awakens. Won\u2019t get into spoilers\\, but we were promised a real role for Phasma - they lied. We were promised this one wouldn\u2019t be as derivative as Force Awakens - they lied. We hoped for a satisfying conclusion for Princess Leia\\, given Carrie Fisher\u2019s passing - they failed... miserably... with very obvious better choices. Can\u2019t understand the initial glowing critical reviews. Were they paid for? All things considered\\, not good. The worst of the new films by far. After time\\, consideration\\, and another viewing\\, I\u2019m knocking off another star. There\u2019s a ton of problems with this movie. Watch the \u201cHow it should have ended\u201d video on Youtube for some of the highlights. Biggest problem tho\\, you can\u2019t break Luke\u2019s defining character trait like that. At least not without an entire movie of character (re)building to support it. Luke\u2019s defining trait from the original series was that he could see the sliver of good in anyone and would never give up trying to bring them back to the light\\, even if it killed him. If there\u2019s one \u201cpoint\\,\u201d one takeaway from the originals it\u2019s that. This film\\, without setup or real explanation\\, shows us the opposite\\, a Luke who sees a sliver of bad in a person and can barely resist killing him. It\u2019s garbage. ","true":true}
