The last of us part 2 has astaunishing graphics\\, realism in vedo game at its peak\\, acting performance that is just extroardinary\\, gameplay who puts you in stressfull sitations just like the resident evil style. But... its story... is just a mess and when you played the first game\\, you know that the only thing that matters is story. I was waiting since decmber 2013 when i first finished the last of us to this day to see what happened to Joel and Ellie but now I just tell to myself why did you expect a sequel? The last of us is a story of relationship between Ellie and Joel. Joel has lost evrything in the first game including his humanity. But he gets it back thanks to Ellie who slowly healed his heart. And Joel\\, just acting like all other people would've act\\, saved Ellie. So now in this second game\\, instead of having an illustration of Ellie's relationship with Joel all along the game\\, we just show you Joel in some flashbacks wich in total are about 1h10min. Yes... 1h10 min of Joel in the last of us part 2 wich is 25 hours long. You kill the main character of the series and after you are forced to play 10 hours as the strong woman who killed him just to sympathize with her for what she has done. Let me just say this clear\\, this isn't a naughty dog game\\, this is a Sarkaziaan and Druckman game. Kill all the male characters\\, Joel\\, Jesse\\, and letting alive the submitted husband wich is Tommy\\, but even if he is submitted he still a man so we will make sure he loses an eye and the use of one of his legs. You kill Joel to introduce another character at his place wich nobody cares because she has no reason to be in this game\\, Yes Joel killed her father because he was trying to kill Ellie. You kill a young man named Jessie\\, which is honnestly for me the only good new character\\, just to make sure your plan of having a lesbian family will work. And when the end is near\\, you let live the only person who braught you all these nightmares just to make sure she will be the main character of the next game because she is a STRONG WOMAN WHO DEFENDS A TRANSGENDER INOCENT CHILD WHO KILLED HER MOTHER. So bassicly they kill Joel\\, kill Jesse\\, ruin Tommy's life and made a reality of Ellie's gratest fear of being alone\\, but miss hulk gets to live because she's a strong woman and an example for everyone. This is disgusting\\, i am just so sad for what they have done to all the characters\\, this game was ment to destroy them because of identical ideologies of mister druckman and miss sarkaziaan. I'm not expecting any more game from this studio\\, only if the ancient employees will come back\\, wich will never happen.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
