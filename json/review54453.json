Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll try and keep the spoilers to a minimum but I was disappointed in this movie. I will concede that where The Force Awakens played it fairly safe with familiar Star Wars plot lines\\, The Last Jedi embraces risks and pushes the envelope more. For that reason\\, I don't view The Last Jedi as a complete trainwreck. There are some good ideas and some strong cinematic moments that were well executed.\\n\\nHowever\\, this movie does not do justice to the foundation of content that was created in episode 7. I feel like Johnson had no regard for the story that was slowly being developed and stripped away much of the potential that fans were hoping to see when the credits rolled. I can't explain without jumping into spoilers but I just didn't feel that some characters weren't developed correctly and that's what leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.","true":true}
