Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I watch this movie\\, the more not bad it is. The cinematography is really amazing\\, not to mention the creativity of the the new planets. Some characters are a little annoying\\, but Daisy Ridley is actually a phenomenal actress and Rey is an interesting character. Sadly\\, we were rid of Snoke rather quickly\\, but curious to see how Ben's inner conflict will manifest itself. Overall\\, not a bad piece of work!","true":true}
