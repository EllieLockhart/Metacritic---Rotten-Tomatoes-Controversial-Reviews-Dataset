Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not shocked that The Last Jedi is getting low ratings from fanboys. They have always be intolerant to change in the Star Wars universe. But for things to move on\\, for things to grow\\, there needs to be change. That's what this whole movie is about. TLJ is a rich film with great character development and themes about hope and redemption in times of darkness. If the fanboys turn off their blinders and realize that\\, they will come to appreciate TLJ and stop throwing temper tantrums because nothing is exactly the way it was in the past. As Kylo says in the film \\\"Let the past die. It's the only way to become what you are meant to be.\\\"","true":true}
