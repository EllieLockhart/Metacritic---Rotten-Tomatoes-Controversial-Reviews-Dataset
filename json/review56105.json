Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry\\, but this is the most disappointing Star Wars movie ever (and I'm a fan of all previous movies).  Rian Johnson seems more interested in Rian Johnson's ideas than Star Wars ideas\\, its historical themes or its fans.  This movie seems to exist in a bubble\\, and seems disconnected from the rest of the Star Wars movies\\, including its immediate predecessor\\, The Force Awakens! Rian Johnson almost seems intent in this movie seems to prove that nothing\\, that happened in Star Wars prior to The Last Jedi\\, matters.  (You thought Luke was a good guy?  Well\\, think again.  You thought you knew the Force?  Well\\, think again.  You thought you knew Rey's backstory? Well\\, think again.  Oh\\, you thought you knew Snoke's background.  Sorry\\, think again.  You have been wrong along!  Oh the previous movies and stories set up the history and characters\\, and you were expecting a payoff\\, as is normal in many other movies?  Sorry\\, think again!)\\nIf you're a life-long Star Wars fan\\, this movie could be a bitter pill for you to swallow.  (On the other hand\\, there are clearly some people that seem to be okay with this movie.) What is good about this movie? Special and visual effects\\, and cinematography.  Even the acting's not bad.  But do you want the wrapping or the present? The present (the story) is\\, sorry to say\\, awful.  Even if Rian Johnson is to blame\\, it baffles me that Lucasfilm and Disney actually let this movie make it to theaters.  I can only hope that the final episode (IX) in this trilogy can redeem some of the horrible character and story choices made in this movie.","true":true}
