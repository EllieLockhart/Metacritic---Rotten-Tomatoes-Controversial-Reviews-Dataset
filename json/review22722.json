Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Linear script\\, lighting and production design. ridiculous humor along the movie. poor acting direction. some very good scenes. mark hamill was amazing. overall a disappointing experience not worthy of a Star Wars entey.","true":true}
