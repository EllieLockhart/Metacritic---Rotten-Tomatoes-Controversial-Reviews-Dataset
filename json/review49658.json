Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow was this bad. Bumped it up a half star for a good twist at the end but this really drags\\, none of the jokes hit\\, and it just stinks. Honestly\\, the Pg rating does it no favors. This totally feels like a kids movie now. Star Wars is officially ruined. ","true":true}
