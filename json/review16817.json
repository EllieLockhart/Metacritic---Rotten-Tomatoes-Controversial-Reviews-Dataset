Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In some ways it reminded me more of LOTR: The Two Towers than The Empire Strikes Back. It's all about taking these characters through the most hopeless situations\\, yet somehow keeping a faint glimmer of hope alive. I can't wait to see where they go with the next one!","true":true}
