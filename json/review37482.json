Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some elements to like\\, but the Star Wars Universe is worse after this movie\\, rather than before it.  Some character choices are baffling.\\n\\nA scene for example:  A tearful goodbye from Leia to Holdo...  This is how we're introduced to Holdo and Leia's relationship...  I'm confused\\, I guess they were friends?\\n\\nEpisode I is at least fun for kids.  This just is annoying.  Interesting how they'll be able to salvage the story from here\\, but that's only because this fil was so awful.  Rey still has no training\\, I still have no clue what's going on with the universe as a whole\\, or even who is more powerful than who.  Seems like the New Order and the Resistance didn't even matter in the Universe and are both small factions in this movie.  \\\"Meh.\\\"","true":true}
