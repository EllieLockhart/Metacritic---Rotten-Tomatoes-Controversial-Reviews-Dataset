Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, there are some parts which don't work (the side quest\\, Holdo's motivations\\, some of the comedy) but all in all\\, it's a very thoughtful and touching story\\, and the twists remind us all why we love Star Wars.","true":true}
