Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adding a disgusting chapter in the late great Star Wars saga\\, The Last Jedi was a blight to behold. The drudginly long and held out film showed the disturbance of a company \\\"juicing it\\\" for all its worth. Hidden under a terrible story\\, pathetic acting\\, slapstick humor\\, and leftist-pushing political messages lies the prospects of a decent movie but we just don't get that with this one. Disney once again plays us as sheep.","true":true}
