Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ALERT:  watch the Youtube discussions of this film.  \\nI encourage everyone to read some of the now non-canon books and other stories about Star Wars.  They far exceed the capacity of this Sci-Fi tragedy.  \\nStar Wars used to get people through rough times.  It encouraged young people to rise to the occasion and strike at evil while learning enough about themselves to make their own judgments.  \\nThis movie throws away all of that.  There is nothing to learn\\, nothing to explore\\, and nothing to love.  \\nThis film would not spawn novels\\, video games\\, and dreams in its likeness\\, but the originals did.","true":true}
