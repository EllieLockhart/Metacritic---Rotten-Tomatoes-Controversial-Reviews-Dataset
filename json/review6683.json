Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't even know where to begin. This is simply not a Star Wars film. This movie is only made to make as much money as possible with no thought for story line or character building. So many plot holes I don't have time or space to say them all. Don't even want to watch the next episode.","true":true}
