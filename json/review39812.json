Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a poor movie with spectacular special effects and set pieces but it doesn't understand the heart of SW and if it does then it's the most cynical version of Star Wars to date.  The Luke Skywalker character was handled terribly\\, disarming the anticipation and reverence for this character with silly quips and idiotic moments. They sacrificed his story to stuff up the arc of the protagonists but in the most irreverent subversive way.\\n\\nSet pieces and special effects have their uniquely amazing moments ( you will know them when you see them) but at the same time we witness some terrible prequelesque FX on the casino planet and through various CGI creatures. There are multiple subplots that serve no purpose other than to give these new characters more screen time\\, screen time that should have been allocated to its original stars\\, or at the very least screen time that held meaningful plot or convincing chemistry and not just placeholders for special effects\\, over-exposition\\, repeating humour and merchandising.  \\n\\nFor the Star Wars fan who became wholeheartedly invested in Luke Skywalker and in the balanced tone of the originals\\, you're going to be cruelly disappointed.  In spite of the plaudits this films seems to be getting by the mass media\\, you will know in your heart that this film has technically inept story telling with morally corrupt motivations.  And now in retrospect\\, it exposes The Force Awakens as a much worse film with its lack of explanation for its convenient plot holes.\\n\\nThis my friends is not just the \\\"Last Jedi\\\"\\, but its the last nail in the coffin for the magic of Star Wars\\, a magic we all felt and loved from the start. Im deeply heartbroken.","true":true}
