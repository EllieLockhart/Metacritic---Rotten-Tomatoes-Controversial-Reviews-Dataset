Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens was an amazing movie\\, it combined all the best parts of the star wars original trilogy and the prequels\\, without the worst parts of the prequels\\,  \\n\\nSo the last jedi was a huge downgrade by comparison\\,  weird plot lines\\, often times poorly executed humor\\, and just all in all\\, an uninspired mess\\, it tries so hard to be shocking and NEW! That it just comes off as another try hard sequel. \\n\\nSome scenes were good\\, but the movie as a whole\\, falls flat.","true":true}
