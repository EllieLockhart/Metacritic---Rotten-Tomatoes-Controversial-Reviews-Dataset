Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved a lot about this movie! I think the entire gang old and new were given great moments to shine.. some things were left un answered but then again. some things are not meant to be answered remember the prequels? Did having the exact answer enrich the story? hmm. anyhoo... I loved it Star Wars has been a series that's given so much joy to so many and continues to do so\\, so long as it profits.","true":true}
