Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While nothing can over come nostalgia for something you grew up with Star Wars: The Last Jedi grows past the expected Star wars formula. \\n\\nCharacters grew and changed in unexpected ways and while a little long in the tooth time wise and a little clunky from time to time with humor that never quite lands these negatives don't outweigh the overwhelming positives. \\n\\nLast Jedi moves us away from The Force Awakens return to form (which was needed for the first installment of this new trilogy) and provides genuine wonder for the final film as I honestly have no idea what they will do to resolve the story.\\n\\nIt might not be the best Star Wars films ever made but it is FAR from the worst.","true":true}
