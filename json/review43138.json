Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This quite simply ruined my Christmas. Rian Johnson destroyed all the good work from Abrams. The plot was weak\\, the characters shallow\\, and the sense of humor was infantile. When will directors realize that people want storylines and not over the top cgi. It seems like it was directorial ego trip and a worrying sign that Disney are now just gonna turn the franchise into another bland cash cow.","true":true}
