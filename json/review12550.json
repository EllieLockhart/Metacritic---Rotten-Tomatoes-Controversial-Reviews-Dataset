Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe what they are passing for a good star wars movies!!! What crap!! Awakens was a reboot of star wars a new hope I still can't believe they killed Han!!!!!! That was so stupid!!! And this one you killed the wrong person !!!!! Wtf!!!! stupid!!! Thank god I didn't pay for this crap!!! Justice league was way better!!!!","true":true}
