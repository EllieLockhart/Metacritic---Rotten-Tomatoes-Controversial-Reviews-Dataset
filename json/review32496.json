Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars - ruined forever. I can\u2019t express my disappointment. More plot holes than a Swiss cheese. Snoke didn\u2019t last 5 minutes. Rey a nobody. Luke dies for practically no reason. The end has leia ready to start the next film. No decent force battles. ","true":true}
