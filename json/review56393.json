Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank the social justice warriors and femenists for destroying a once exciting\\, and respectable franchise. This movie made want to roll my eyes into the back of my head multiple times. Also Rose is now my least favorite star wars character to ever exist. The franchise is dead. They could've made this movie so special\\, but they chose to kill off luke\\, and make it a femenist marvel. TERRIBLE MOVIE IF YOU ARE AN ACTUAL STAR WARS FAN. Good movie if you have never seen a single star wars movie except for Force Awakens.","true":true}
