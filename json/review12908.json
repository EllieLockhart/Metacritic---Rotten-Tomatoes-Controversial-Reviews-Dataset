{"101487":130642,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think The Last Jedi was a particularly good film at all.  While I think that it is a positive thing that the film is more diverse than earlier installments\\, whether or not a movie is diverse or not is largely irrelevant as to whether a movie is good. Whether or not a movie is good or not depends on criteria like: (i) the quality of the writing; (ii) is the script internally consistent in its own terms; (iii) is the writing consistent with a larger body of epistemology (or canon) where such a body of knowledge exists; (iv) the quality of the acting in executing the script; (v) the quality of the cinematography. I could go on but I hope you get the idea. \\n\\nIn my view\\, the Last Jedi was a fairly poor movie:\\n\\nFirst\\, it contains plenty of incidents of bad writing. For example\\, shoehorning dialogue and famous lines from previous movies into the new movie. New characters awkwardly repeating famous lines from better films made in the late 70s and early 80s is never going to be memorable. \\n\\nSecond\\, the movie contains several examples of bad design. One telling example is the First Order. The craft and weapons of the First Order appear to be those of the Empire but with everything being larger with more guns stapled on. This is actually somewhat nostalgic to me as this is how I would design new Star Wars vehicles as a small child.\\n\\nThird\\, there were too many characters in the script that somehow were considered to each deserve significant screen time. Put simply; if a scene (or character) is not required to forward the plot consider whether it is desirable to leave the scene (or character) in the movie. In my view\\, the desire to give every character significant screen time resulted in a bloated movie with plots that simply went nowhere. The clear example is the sojourn of Rose and Finn to the casino planet. Not only did this simply feel like both an afterthought\\, an errand to give two characters but it otherwise detracted from the urgency of the major premise of the film (being a sense of urgency concerning the Rebel fleet being hunted and systematically destroyed by the First Order). The threat posed by the First Order simply doesn't seem legitimate when there is time to take a break and travel to the casino planet. That said\\, we did get a nice lecture on the casino planet that: (i) war; (ii) child slavery; and (iii) animal cruelty are all bad (just incase there was anyone with brain damage who didn't think that these principles were axiomatic\\, on second thoughts you might want to remove (ii) and (iii) for the Chinese release). \\n\\nFourth\\, the major premise of the movie did not really work for me and seemed internally inconsistent. Further\\, other plot points didn't make sense given the internal logic of the script (and perhaps wider Star Wars films).  For example: (i) the First Order could have ended the Rebel fleet at any moment (or at the very least there was a lack of urgency concerning the situation which the Rebels found themselves in); (ii) I didn't understand why Rose would crash a vehicle into Finn. This act would have likely killed them both and still ultimately doomed them as the cannon they were trying to disable was still functional and a threat to the rebellion. In short\\, this was not a virtuous act\\, plus Rose and Finn crashed right in front of the whole First Order army with no consequences); (iii) as a related point there was too much plot armour for certain hero characters (but not others). This deprives the film of tension and makes other deaths seem arbitrary and capricious (again Rose and Finn somehow being totally unharmed on the Star Destroyer when it was rammed by the Rebel admiral when a legion of Storm Troopers instantly died around them; and super Leia flying through space was strange (this didn't seem to be necessary at all)).\\n\\nFifth\\, there was pointless conflict between rebel characters which again is more just a product of the politics of our time rather than adding much to the film.\\n\\nFinally\\, I don't think the movie handled Luke Skywalker well at all (it was a disservice to the source material and the three movies which made him an iconic character). Assume that I have starting watching Football (soccer) for the first time\\, although the rules have never been explained to me\\, after watching several matches I understanding that players can't pick up the ball with their hands besides the goal keeper. If a player suddenly picked up a ball I would think something is intuitively wrong despite not formally knowing the rules. The same is true where a series of films have created a body of informal rules\\, it is good writing to subvert expectations\\, and it is bad writing to subvert the rules. The Last Jedi does the latter and not the former to the key protagonist to the original series. Luke Skywalker bears little relationship to the well-established character contained in the previous films.\\n\\nAs a final note it I appears my previous review was deleted for some reason","true":true}
