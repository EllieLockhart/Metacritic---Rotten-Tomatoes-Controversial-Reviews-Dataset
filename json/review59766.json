The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is a below average game with a shockingly twisted story\\, dear oh my all that great talent and acting wasted on a script like this. And despite seeing all the anger from many people due to certain scenes\\, deaths\\, the ending\\, none of that really matters.\r\rWhat matters is\\, you took away the loving bond that was the heart and soul of this series by killing Joel and creating a dark revenge storyline that eventually \\\"killed\\\" Ellie too and this series as well\\, instead of something more positive and vibrant.\r\rThis is what brings depression to the people of our world. Video games are over if this continues\\, they are meant to relax\\, amuse and entertain you. Sometimes make you cry\\, but not leave you depressed\\, horrified and absolutely destroyed on the inside.\r\rFor example\\, our dear Italian friend Hideo who sells pizza for a living loved this series back from the PS3 days\\, he couldn't contain his tears and went off from our discord and into anxiety when this originally leaked\\, and now 3 months later he is still in such disbelief and shock that he refuses to talk to anyone about anything gaming or spaghetti related. We hope you are ok wherever you are partner. Thanks for ruining him Neil\\, you and your golf game did this. Ugh\\, he's never going to be eating spaghetti again.\r\rSome good moments as to why it's still a solid game\\, the visuals are very good\\, as well as the fluid facial and body animations\\, but it still feels like it's the first game just in 4k with a few more gameplay tweaks. Which isn't bad\\, but overally due to everything else\\, yeah...can't get a good grade.\r\rAnd last but not least\\, a few hours after beating the game\\, i am left to wonder two more simple things.\r\rWas the sequel really needed? No\r\rIs our Dedito really gae? Yes.\r\rOnce again\\, thanks Neil.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
