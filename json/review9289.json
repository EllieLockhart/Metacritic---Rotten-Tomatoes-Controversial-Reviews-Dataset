Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. Terrible plot devices that are slow to play out and have no pay-off. Rian Johnson appears never to have seen a Star Wars movie\\, as he has no idea what to do with the OT characters (or even the new characters). Numerous plot holes...Literally a 2.5 hour movie where nothing happens. What a shame to not capitalize on what TFA promised. I can't even see how JJ can save this trilogy in EP IX.","true":true}
