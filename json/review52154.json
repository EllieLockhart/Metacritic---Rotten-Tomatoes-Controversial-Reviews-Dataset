Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the last one I expected very little. This one was great. Back to most of what I loved about Star Wars. Lovable characters\\, deep while fun\\, lots of cool environments\\, eye candy\\, awesome creatures and characters\\, quotable\\, interesting\\, slightly unpredictable and totally fun. I did not feel like I was being patronized like the Force Awakens. The spark of hope for Star Wars has been reignited.","true":true}
