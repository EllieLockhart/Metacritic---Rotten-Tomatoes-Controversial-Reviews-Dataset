Even if you abhor the plot\\, the other aspects of the game are still incredible and it really is not fair to give it such low scores.\rI tend to like only action games and have very little patience for most games\\, yet I played through and beat this game. The combat which may feel clunky at first to FPS fans is actually very well done and makes for great gameplay. The graphics are the best I've seen and the overall polish and attention to detail is incredible. They made some interesting choices with what you do as the player which makes the game a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. There is some hate about this aspect too\\, but honestly I feel it adds to the game by invoking different emotions in you and also how you perceive\/play being changed based on your feelings towards what is happening.\rMy two complaints are:\r1) The infected are the least interesting part of the game. The combat with them feels like a chore given how much more fun and interesting the combat against other humans is.\r2)  There is a bit too much \\\"interactive movie\\\" content where you are just walking through areas. It is great drooling at the graphics\\, but I would have preferred a bit more action.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
