Having been developing indie video games for almost 9 years\\, I can confirm that although the graphics\\, sound design\\, gameplay mechanics\\, and the soundtrack is 10\/10\\, the way that the story is implemented is not good at all. If you're planning to kill a legendary character(you don't actually have to)\\, kill it in a legendary way. Joel is a character that everyone loves and cares about. People who have waited for 7 years for this game are disappointed and the game is not worth a dime from their perspective. This game is a storytelling game and without a proper story\\, even though all the aspects are perfect\\, it doesn't appeal to us. We should not be forced to play as a character that we don't like either. This game could've been at least a tiny bit better if it gave us choices at the critical points along with the story so that we could either save Joel or lose him because of making a mistake. There are many games out there that implemented the butterfly effect. No doubt that Naughty Dog could've done it as well. I guess it's all the director's fault.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
