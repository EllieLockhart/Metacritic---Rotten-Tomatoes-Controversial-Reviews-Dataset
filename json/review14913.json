Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)m not certain why the audience score was so low. I am one of those people who have been watching Star Wars since the very beginning. Like The Empire Strikes Back\\,  this film takes some unexpected turns. In my opinion  these are all mature choices showing great storytelling and excellent dramatic choices over just making it another video game. I think time will favor this movie  and erase all of the hate and calling it received by  a certain group  of disgruntled fans.","true":true}
