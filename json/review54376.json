{"101487":134004,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to believe that the low Audience Score for this film is based off \\\"reviews\\\" from people who 1) Hate that Disney now owns Star Wars or 2) Just hate us geeks who look forward to this saga.  With that said\\, here is my review.\\n\\nI took my wife (non-Star Wars fan\\, doesn't hate\\, doesn't love\\, but loves me) and my three daughters (13\\, 10\\, & 7) to see the movie yesterday.  The fact that I love the movie comes as no surprise to anyone.  Since I have been able to indoctrinate daughters into my fandom since birth\\, it is no surprise that they love the movie\\, but the fact that my wife was ready to fork out another $80 for the five of us to see it shows the movie making and story telling abilities of Rian Johnson.  Johnson does a fantastic job of telling a new story while paying homage to the existing story lines.  \\n\\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\\n\\nI can see why some nit-pickers will complain\\, when you step back and look at it.  There is a little Battlestar Galactica rub. There are scenes reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back\\, with the walkers attacking a base on a deserted planet\\, a base being defended by rebels in trenches with the help of gun turrets. \\n\\nThere are twists that are not predictable though and that it what makes this movie so FANTASTIC.  Who saw Snoke's demise?  Who predicted the two differing \\\"points of view\\\" for Ben\/Kylo's quick decent into the dark side?  Who predicted exactly how powerful Luke had become?  And who predicted what would happen after the Throne Room Battle?  \\n\\nIn the end I don't know if I like The Last Jedi more than Rogue One\\, but it has easily replaced Return of the Jedi in my Top 3 Star Wars movies.  Before it was Rogue One and The Empire Strikes Back as my back and forth Top 2\\, more like a 1a and 1b with Return of the Jedi in a trailing 3rd.  But now I definitely have Top Tier\\, with Return of the Jedi\\, A New Hope\\, and Revenge of the SIth in a second tier\\, and the abominations that were The Phantom Menace and The Clone Wars as a very distant bottom tier.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, don't see this movie because it has a 93% Certified Fresh rating from the critics.  Don't not see this movie because at the time that I write this is has a 56% Audience Score.  See this movie because it is epic storytelling in a universe far far away that will leave you wanting to see more.  \\\"See you around\\, kid.\\\"","true":true}
