Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HORRIBLE!! The were issues with the force awakens but it left you wanting more. So many questions and mysteries you wanted to find out. The last Jedi takes those questions and mystery about this trilogy and shows it down a garbage disposal. Now I\u2019m left leaving this movie not caring and really mad at how it ended. It was a great movie but the important parts about the plot they really screwed up. ","true":true}
