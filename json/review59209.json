The story is well written with interesting main characters with their own moral and development through the game and the ending is AMAZING\\, coherent and SAD\\, THERE ARE NO PLOT HOLES and the stupid haters are spreading this lie for no reason. The only problem I had with the plot is they way it is shown\\, some flashbacks are a little bit long and shown in inappropriate scenes\\, so I think I would give an 9\/10 because of this.( I gave 10 cause a lot of stupid haters are bombing negative reviews and they don't even played the game)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
