Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They made the trailer look like it was going to fulfill so many expectations for a great continuation of the Star Wars story. Sadly\\,  I was severely let down. What Star Wars was\\, seems like it will never be the same especially in light of the upcoming Solo movie.  No one wants a political agenda shoved down their throat when they come to watch their beloved characters but rather they come for a thrilling well thought-out storyline which this movie lacks. You should \\\"Have a bad feeling about this\\\" movie.","true":true}
