Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"unnecessary side-plots that are actual detrimental to a logical story. Crappy villains and the death at the end? Random. Seemed like a writers plot device. Most of the events of the movie seemed to be simply means to reaching a poor end.","true":true}
