Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It may be because I've read so many of the expanded universe books but I really hate the direction Disney has taken the series. Lukes character in particular just makes no sense to me. The movie wasn't bad but it really didn't feel like Star Wars. I thought TFA and Rouge One were decent but TLJ has pretty much turned me off to the series. Snoke should have turned out to be Plagueis and Kylo\/Rey should have teamed up more than they did. I also really disliked the little jokes they kept throwing in. Particularly those among the New Order. They seemed so out of place.","true":true}
