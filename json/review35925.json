Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is trash! I love the series but this was so bad. There are giant potholes I can't overlook. The movie shows every male character is a complete idiot and every female character is always right. There are three Hillary Clinton clones running the Resistance\\, being all noble and saviors because the stupid men wreck everything. \\n The noble act of sacrifice that saves the day is so simple and obvious that\\, if it worked EVERY SINGLE REBEL before this should have done it before and the Galaxy would have been saved a thousand times over by now !\\n But Benicio Del Toro was terrific as Lando.","true":true}
