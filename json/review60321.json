There were times I wanted to put the controller down and never pick it up\\, but I couldn't do that to myself. I think that people have given this game a bad rap because the story does things they don't like. If a story only does good things to characters you love then you can NEVER have any good growth or conflict. If someone plays through this whole story and doesn't like it. That's fine\\, it's not for everyone and people are entitled to their own opinion. I think many of these negative reviews aren't by people who actually played it all the way through. There is no way this game deserves less than a 5\/10. The graphics and gameplay alone are a 10\/10.Long story short: play the game with an open mind\\, and prepare to be upset\\, disappointed\\, angry\\, and heartbroken. This is a story about human nature. The good\\, the bad\\, and the ugly of human nature.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
