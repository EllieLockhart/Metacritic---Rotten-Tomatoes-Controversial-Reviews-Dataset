Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Someone has to try and bring some balance to this hateful madness! This movie is a great Star Wars movie in every way. I grew up loving Star Wars\\, and this was a fitting continuation of Abram\u2019s TFA. I love where Disney is taking the franchise. As far as I\u2019m concerned\\, keep \u2018me coming guys!","true":true}
