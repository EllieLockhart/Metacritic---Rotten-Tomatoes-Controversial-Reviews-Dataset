Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A frustrating amount of nothing. Confused character motivations and character arcs go nowhere or outright make the situation worse without improving the character or giving the audience anything meaningful to take away. It tries to be A character study of Rey and Ren\\, but fails at that as well\\, as within the film's own logic Rey is without need of training (despite her apparent lack of training) and Ren is a lost cause. A step backward from The Force Awakens\\, it almost feels as if it makes that film worse by association. There was not even enough entertaining action to keep the dumb part of my brain stimulated. Not to mention the movie is full of awkward\\, stilted comedy that does not fit the tone and only helps to further disengage the audience from what is actually happening.\\n\\nI enjoyed one scene out of this two and a half hour movie\\, one image really\\, and that was the immediate aftermath of the lightspeed collision. Beautiful imagery\\, wish it had been in a better film.\\n\\nA movie filled with missed opportunities","true":true}
