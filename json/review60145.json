We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"first off. i did not buy the game i watched the whole playthough and honestly the gameplay looked good and graphics look good but the story in a STORY DRIVEN GAME... it sucks badly\\, this is what happens when you let a feminist man hating person like Anita Sarkeesian influence your game\\, Joel dies at the hands of Abby for seeking revenge (not even a heroic ending not even no last words for Ellie no \\\"i love you Ellie\\\" nothing just straight up dead like he presence didn't even matter in first game) Jessie a new GUY that you'll quickly like.. dead.. Tommy loses an eye and gets divorced from his wife\\, and the worst of it all Abby is the ONLY one in the game who gets revenge\\, thaaaat's right... at the end of the game Ellie gets a chance to kill Abby and DOESN'T EVEN DO IT. its like watching Avengers end game and tony snapping his fingers at thee end and dies but leaves Thanos alive.. or or its like avengers infinity war when Thanos snaps his fingers and half of the universe is gone and.. that's it the end\\, no sequel.. honestly i don't see how 42\\,000 people can give this game a positive review i don't see it\\, and the reason why people hate this game is not because of the lesbian stuff that is in it\\, we watched Ellie kissed a girl in a dlc and kissed another girl at E3 last year and people still pre-ordered the game until the leaks came out and saw what happen to Joel.. the reason why i'm giving this game an awful review is because this STORY DRIVEN GAME HAS NO PAY OFF AT THE END.. NONE. i would say rent it first\\, and then if you like it then you can waste your money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
