Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked it a lot. For the most part Rian Johnson really captured the feel of a Star Wars movie. There were some weaker moments\\, Finn and Rose riding the animals and Poe's idiot plot\\, but they were overshadowed by everything involving Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo which was near perfect.","true":true}
