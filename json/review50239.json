Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excelente encerramento para a trilogia! O diretor teve pulso firme para fazer o que fez sem ligar para certos tipos de f\u00e3s!","true":false}
