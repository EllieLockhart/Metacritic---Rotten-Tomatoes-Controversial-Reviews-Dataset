{"101487":200061,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know I find it quite amusing and irritating how quickly fans turned on The Force Awakens and how people thought they were so clever to figure out it was a remake of A New Hope.  How ironic it is in the wake of the GODDAMN mess that is Star Wars: The Last Jedi that we are on the same page.  And what a tightly crafted masterpiece The Force Awakens appears after the mixed results of Rogue One and the endlessly bad decisions of Last Jedi.  Yes\\, I am a fanboy.  How utterly humiliating it is to admit that on account of the ridiculous\\, infantile behavior of my compatriots over the last couple of decades. I am aware that I may not be the most objective source of criticism when it comes to Star Wars.  Nonetheless\\, I will proceed to do as exhaustive an analysis of this controversial and heavily debated installment as I can.  \\n\\nLet's get this point right off the bat.  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not a terrible film on its own cinematic merits.  It's a beautiful looking movie that actually exceeds Force Awakens and Rogue One in terms of its color scheme and visual aesthetic.  And the performances are solid all around.  However\\, as a Star Wars movie\\, it's an abject failure and an embarrassment that will haunt the franchise for years to come.  I'm not going to lie and tell you that it's worse than The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones\\, but I would argue that Revenge of the Sith was a superior Star Wars movie and added more to the franchise.  \\n\\nLet's go down the list of incomprehensible and ridiculous things that happen in The Last Jedi.  The humor is for the most part\\, a complete wash.  I have no clue whose fucking idea it was to copy\/paste the jokes from a Marvel Disney movie\\, but they should be shot.  The humor in Guardians of the Galaxy works because the characters clearly do not take themselves seriously.  This is not the case with Star Wars and its historically straight-faced heroes and villains.  How Luke Skywalker's character was handled in this film is already the stuff of infamous legend.  Luke Skywalker\\, the modern hero of a thousand faces\\, the TRUE chosen one who helped put the galaxy back to rights after Anakin Skywalker burned half of it down\\, the man who risked his life and refused to kill the second most evil man in the series and converted him back to the light.  Now...reduced to an old coward who considered killing his nephew on the chance he MIGHT be evil.  Oh\\, and he gets probably the LAMEST sendoff of any major character in the series - dying inexplicably after projecting an image of himself on another planet.  Jesus Christ.  This alone might be grounds for sending Rian Johnson to The Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity.  \\n\\nHyperbolic and absurd as that sounds\\, there are more problems.  Snoke is offed prematurely with no explanation to his origins\\, how he assembled the First Order\\, or how he was so dramatically overpowered.  The entire second act is a boring\\, miserable nightmare that takes place on a casino planet and has little to no impact on the plot.  Worse yet\\, it is driven forward by perhaps the most useless character in the franchise since Jar Jar fucking Binks - Rose Tico.  I don't know if I agree with the sentiment that Kelly Marie Tran was included only to corner the burgeoning Chinese market\\, but I do know that every word out of her mouth is useless\\, cringe-y after school special nonsense that drags the film down.  She actively impedes the other characters and made the once fun and amusing Finn into a boring character saddled with the B-plot.  On top of this\\, said nadir of the sequel trilogy would never come to pass if Admiral Holdo (or Admiral Tumblr Hair as she has been derisively labeled) simply told Poe Dameron her fucking plan.  Oh\\, and I am not exactly an Alt-Right troll\\, but the effort this movie goes to make EVERY male an idiot or a coward and EVERY woman correct reeked of SJW bullshit.  Don't prove the mouth breathers right Hollywood.  They don't need more ammunition.\\n\\nSo\\, what does work?  Like I said before The Last Jedi is simply beautiful and a joy to look at.  Most of the action scenes don't work\\, especially the giant cop out that is the last battle\\, but the opening space clash did deliver the goods of setting the tone of the movie and raising the stakes for a fleeing Resistance that is essentially being exterminated.  The throne room clash involving Rey and Kylo Ren proves one of the best in the series\\, and its brutality and kinetic energy kept me on the edge of my seat.  The performances are surprisingly good with top marks going to the main leads.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver prove to be the highlights of this new sequel trilogy and their will-they-fuck-or-kill-each-other dynamic is far more engrossing than it should be.  Mark Hamill's dissatisfaction with Rian Johnson's treatment of his character is well known\\, but he goes above and beyond to convey the strain and emotion of the legendary Jedi in his scenes with Rey.  It actually makes me more upset that we did not get more of him in lieu of time-wasting subplots.  Carrie Fisher makes her final film appearance and like Hamill she has great moments\\, superb delivery\\, and memorable one-liners in addition to dramatic speeches.  \\\"SuperLeia\\\" might be a laughable meme now\\, but the real problem is that in hindsight she was probably the character who needed to pass away this time around\\, instead of Luke.  This is quite similar to The Dark Knight where the wrong villain was killed off at the end\\, leaving the sequel with no established villain to finish the trilogy on.  Laura Dern's character may have been a bit too thinly written and the role could have been entirely replaced with fan favorite Admiral Ackbar\\, but she does well with what little she is given and her hero moment ALMOST makes it worthwhile.  You'll know it when you see it.  DAMN.  \\n\\nIn summation\\, The Last Jedi is a mess of a Star Wars film and shows signs of an auteur director getting his way over every facet of production\\, which is shocking considering Kathleen Kennedy's tyrannical handling of the franchise.  I suspect this will be the last time\\, as others like him have been shitcanned mercilessly.  (Expect \\\"developments\\\" and \\\"delays\\\" to appear in the coming months with his separate planned trilogy.)  Furthermore\\, J.J. Abrams will probably retcon much of this in the next installment to keep fans pleased\\, or at least as much can be allowed without breaking logic - though in space opera this isn't much of an issue.  It's certainly not the worst movie of 2017.  Far from it.  But fans deserved better.  And I suspect they will.  Crazy.  It's the second time in a few years that \\\"hack fraud\\\" J.J. Abrams will be called up to \\\"save\\\" Star Wars.  We'll see.","true":true}
