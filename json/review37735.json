Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was no gradual \\\"passing of the torch\\\" from these characters to the new generation\\, It's like you hated these characters. It's like they where in your way and you rushed to get rid of them.\\n\\nYou turned Luke into a tired\\, lazy\\, grumpy old man who wanted nothing to do with the Force or the Jedi for that matter. WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND WOULD DO THIS!!!\\n\\nWhat's worse\\, is that you really did nothing through-out the movie to fix this. You almost (somewhat) redeemed yourself having Luke face off with Kylo. But he wasn't even there to face him! He was  still stuck on that damn planet!! THEN\\, he just dies!!! WHY!?!?!  it was't like he exuded any form of real energy!!\\n\\nAnd Luke\\, milking that...whatever the hell it was\\, was just weird and wrong!\\n\\nThen the rest of the movie...\\n\\nWhat a cluster!!\\, no real plot\\, Leia floating through space like some sort of  space witch. Snoke just dies with no explanation for who he was or where he came from. No backstory with Rey.\\n\\nJ.J. you've got a mess to clean up. If it's even possible.","true":true}
