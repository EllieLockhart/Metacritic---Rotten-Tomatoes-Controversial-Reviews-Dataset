{"101487":142518,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a travesty. I went to see it on opening day on the 13th in a suit. In a goddamned suit since Im a huge star wars fan. When the movie ended Ifelt like my soul was crushed. The Last Jedi is SOULCRUSHING. It's just that horrible. If you ever loved star wars stay away from this. Do it for yourself. \\nAlso the Mary Poppins Leia thing\\, the stupenduos chase scene\\, the Rose saves Finn at the end of the movie (that was so idiotic I almost left the cinema)\\, that's all BS. Poorly written BS. Can someone please explain to me in that scene when they escape from jail how in the hell does BB-8 incapacitate 3 enemies. I mean the camera shows the hallway and 3 enemies are lying on the ground with BB-8 being victorious. I mean give me a fucking brake. Someone hand me a fucking gun...","true":true}
