Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Too many characters\\, ships running out of fuel\\, casinos in space\\, making all men look stupid and women looking like smart and brave\\, Luke's character seems jaded and negative\\, prank calling the new order\\, Chewbacca adopting animals\\, Finn and Rey with their bad acting\\, Rose and her annoying character. There's so much more that make this movie so horrible and unwatchable...","true":true}
