Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited a few days to see this movie and even longer to write this review.  My expectations were high as I liked the direction TFA went.  \\n\\nI left the theater in disbelief.  I kept waiting for the \\\"real\\\" movie to start.  I want a redo.  \\n\\nI am scared for IX.  I really don't know how this can be fixed\\, especially with the dull new characters we've been given in return for this movie dumping on our heros.\\n\\nPLEASE\\, keep Rose and the Porgs far away from the next installment.","true":true}
