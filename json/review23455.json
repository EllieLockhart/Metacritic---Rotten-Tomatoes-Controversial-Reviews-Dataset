Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the intricate and fascinating developments...not your usual Star Wars but what it should be in this day & eta for an older and hopefully more intelligent audience who want a bit more. Yet the adventure\\, fun and references are still there. Can't wait to see where IX takes us! Going back to see what I missed! More than once I'll bet!!","true":true}
