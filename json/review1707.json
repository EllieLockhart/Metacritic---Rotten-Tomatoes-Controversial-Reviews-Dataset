Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a person who didn't watch Star War until college\\, my review is perhaps fairer without strong expectations of a long time fan. However\\, my conclusion is\\, this movie is seriously bad. Regardless all the factors of legacy and fandom\\, this movies storytelling technique would probably get a F from any college storytelling class. The entire plot has very few cohesion. From the attack\\, chase\\, Vegas to final stand\\, the story felt apart as separate pieces. For a moment\\, it almost like playing different sections of a videogame.\\nIt is okay to step away from the original Star War and try something new\\, but I think the writer of this movie still portrait the personality of most of the characters very badly. The personalities are inconsistent and does not make sense. I don't think this has anything to do with the original sequel. The writer is incapable of handling a large story like this.","true":true}
