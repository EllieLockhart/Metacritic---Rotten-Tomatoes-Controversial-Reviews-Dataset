Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason im giving this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because it was very exciting to watch and it had some good moments. That being said this movie barely answered any of the questions left from the force awakens\\, and there were way to many plotholes. Snoke is basically thrown away\\, rey doesnt have any parents\\, and luke skywalker doesnt behave or act anything like the character he was in the original trilogy. I really hope they can fix this in episode 9\\, but im afraid too much damage has been done.","true":true}
