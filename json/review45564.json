{"101487":191737,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"VERY disappointing for such a once-great franchise.  Honestly\\, I can't understand how such a badly-written\\, previeous-movies-and-lore-ignoring\\, inconsistent mess can be praised as \\\"The Best Star Wars Ever\\\" by anyone.\\n\\nStar Wars fan or not\\, do all those positive reviewers truly not see the incoherency\\, the plotholes\\, the bad storytelling?  Or is it really so that as long as the special effects are 'spectacular' and there is lots of 'action' and at least one or two profound-sounding phrases\\, brain-dead viewers of today don't really need a story around it anymore?  Hey\\, that concept already proved true with \\\"Mad Max - Fury Road\\\"\\, didn't it?  But then we old-time fans should probably really leave the franchise to the next generation\\, because I don't want to be part of it anymore.\\n\\nThe way this movie is done somehow reminds me of myself as a kid\\, when I hit Big Jim action figures together to imitate dramatic combat\\, without ever bothering to think up a good story around it\\, or a reason why they were actually fighting\\, as long as the fight as such felt 'cool'.\\n\\nBut that's what KIDS do.  A multi-million dollar movie done by a person who is considered PROFESSIONAL\\, and dealing with probably the greatest Sci-Fi franchise the world has seen to date should handle this a bit better I think?  But it doesn't even feel as it the story was all planned out\\, more as if they 'make up stuff from scratch' as they need it. \\n\\nDisney was great once\\, they had wonderful kid's cartoons\\, and wonderful movies to entertain you.  Today we only get cheap CGI and Flash Animator garbage from them\\, that shows neither creativity nor talent nor heart behind it.  It's sad when Disney leaves all that out just because they know the end product will sell either way\\, just because it's a popular franchise name.\\n\\n... one last thing:\\n\\nWhat do you all think makes a Star Wars story so 'special'?  Sure\\, the space battles and laser sword fights are always outstanding highlights to watch.  But for me\\, to take \\\"Force Awakens\\\" as an example\\, there was actually only ONE scene which truly stuck in my mind: the one with Rey and the scrap trader.  She worked almost a day to salvage some gear from a shipwreck and gets no more than 1\/4 ration for it.  Then the scrap trader sees BB-8 and offers to give her no less than 40 full rations for the robot.  Rey grabs for the pile in disbelief\\, and her hands practically sink into it because it's so much\\, probably more food than she has ever seen in her entire live\\, an unbelievable treasure!  And you want to call out to her\\, \\\"Take it\\, take it! What do you care about a robot that you just met 10 minutes ago?\\\"  But even though the offer is so incredibly tempting\\, Rey does decide against it and sticks with BB-8.\\n\\nIn my opinion\\, especially *THIS* is what Disney does not seem to understand: a great deal of what makes the Star Wars lore so special is the decisions the characters make.  Moments like Luke turning off his computer and deciding to trust in the Force instead when shooting the photon torpedo at the Death Star\\, up to choosing the Light Side of the Force instead of giving in to the temptations of the easier ways of the Dark Side.  Doing what you think is RIGHT\\, not what is EASY\\, even if you have to endure hardships and make sacrifices\\, *THOSE* are the moments that are truly remembered in Star Wars\\, the moments that become legend!  Not just 'eye candy'\\, and definitely not a forced female quota or politic agendas!","true":true}
