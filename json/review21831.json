Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just go read the books before Disney bought Star Wars. I'm a Johnson fan but dang\\, missed the mark. Boring\\, plot holes\\, and some WTF decisions that make no sense. Wasted characters\\, plot lines from TFA\\, and screentime. See at s discount or wait till it comes out to rent. The performances we're on point. ","true":true}
