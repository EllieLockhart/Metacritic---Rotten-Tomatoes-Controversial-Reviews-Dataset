Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was horrible. Rian Johnson ruined the setups that TFA made. He took the giant cliffhanger that we were left on and just crapped all over it\\, and he s&!t all over Luke's character\\, as well. It was all  stupid choices with stupid justifications\\, and for the stupid sake of \\\"subverting expectations.\\\"","true":true}
