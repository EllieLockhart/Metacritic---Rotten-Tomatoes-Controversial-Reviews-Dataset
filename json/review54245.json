Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If your going to make a star wars movie without any star wars material\\, then call it something different\\, at least i don't go in there expecting anything star wars related. If it's going to be about a grumpy old weirdo hermit with a milk deficiency living in a stone hut surrounded by alien nuns and lactating camels then just say so.  If it's going to be about an angry kid dressed in his big boy halloween costume with a light up sword who is really mad at his mommy and daddy (and uncle) then just say so\\, if it's really about the estrogen rebellion\\, resistance\\, or the super secret no boys allowed slumber party club  demanding to be in charge and given the keys to the really big ship then just say so\\, if it's going to be 2 hours of really big space ships slowly chasing some other smaller ships with lots of yelling and finger pointing until everyone runs out of gas\\, then just say so\\, if it's going to be a political statement targeting the hypocrisy of the industrial military complex and how they play both sides for the fools only to give the really cool stuff to the first order and the left overs to the good gals then just say so\\, if it's going to be a comedy with women floating through space\\,  prank phone calls\\, a boring old hermit with jedi dementia\\,  kamikaze style soap box derby and roasting little groundhogs then just say so\\, if your going to take years of story and character development and then ignore all of it then just say so\\, If your not going to have Luke Skywalker in the Last Jedi movie then just say so\\, putting his picture on the poster is borderline misleading\\, I'm just saying\\, the Star Wars title really through me off\\, I thought I was going to see a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
