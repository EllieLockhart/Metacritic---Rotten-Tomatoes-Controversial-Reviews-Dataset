Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the critics may find this to be a good movie\\, the fans know that this is not a good Star Wars movie.  The plot lines from the last movie are simply dropped.  Characters that are supposed to play important roles are unceremoniously killed.  And\\, now we know why Mark Hamill disagreed with Johnson's characterization of Luke.  What we learn of Luke in this movie is entirely inconsistent with everything in the original trilogy.  I'm not able to add anything that many other reviews already addressed\\, but I'm making a point to post a review because Last Jedi hurts the franchise far more than the prequels did.","true":true}
