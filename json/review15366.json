Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll try to be spoiler free here\\, but this is - I hate to say it - a boring movie. No questions are answered. The best parts of the movie are the sporadically placed humor\\, and Benicio Del Toro.\\n\\nThe really cool new force tricks can't make up for the overall boring film with a complete lack of answers.","true":true}
