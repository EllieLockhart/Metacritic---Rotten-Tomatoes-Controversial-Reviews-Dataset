Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a long time Star Wars fan and I loved it! I had my hand on my cheeks the whole movie wondering what was going to happen next! Nothing beat the original trilogy but these new episode are in thier own enjoyable league that I am that come along side the originals to deliver an action packed storylines. The only thing I would ask for is deeper character development. I feel like I began to get that with kilo in TLJ and I was happy for it! I don't understand all the poor ratings but to each his own. I pray the final episode delivers a ending that will leave me happily satiated. Or better yet\\, leave me wanting more and never end the cinimatic Star Wars universe!","true":true}
