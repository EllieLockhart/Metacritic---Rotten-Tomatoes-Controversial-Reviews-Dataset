Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to give it four. I really do. But Marry Sue is back. Star Wars has come to something i am not too proud of. I am glad it is back\\, but not with what they've done with it. \\n-For no reason\\, the lady (forgot her name) doesn't let Po do anything. \\n-Rey is somehow as strong in the force as Kylo Ren-who Luke said is very powerful-and fully trained. She somehow saved his life and then got the lightsaber from him. \\n-Captain Phasma dies\\n(not done review?)","true":true}
