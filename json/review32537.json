{"101487":170088,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi Director Rian Johnson has had great success shirking boring film tropes and completely shattering an audience's expectations when it comes to film narratives.  If you think you know what is coming next in his movies\\, you had better think again\\, because it is likely you don't.  The director of The Force Awakens (J.J Abrams) has a knack for successfully and \\\"safely\\\" rebooting nostalgic stories and bringing them to modern audiences.  In the case of The Force Awakens some critics claimed he was a little too safe safe and didn't steer from the source material enough to consider his work to be original.  In fact\\, the term plagiarism was thrown out quite a bit when used to describe his take on the Star Wars Universe.  If we consider this brand of criticism it makes sense that Disney would want to use a director like Johnson for the second film.  He certainly would do anything other than cater to the audience's expectations.  In my opinion the strategy makes a lot of sense.  Use J.J. Abrams to create what is\\, quite frankly\\, almost an exact nostalgic replica of A New Hope to draw in both new and old audiences to convince them that Disney is not going to destroy the galaxy that we have all come to know and then follow-up with a sequel that can continue the legacy while bringing new fresh (and unexpected) ideas to the franchise.  On the drawing board it sounds like a fantastic idea\\, but is this what really happened in The Last Jedi?\\n\\nI went in to the Last Jedi expecting to have a skillfully told continuation of the various story arcs that were created and staged in The Force Awakens.  While Abrams may not have taken many risks\\, he certainly did leave open wide variety of loose ends just waiting to be weaved into the sequel.  A diverse cast of new characters who I genuinely cared about.  Thought provoking ideas about the continuous battle between light and dark sides and what the future of the force truly looked like.  The question of our protagonists' ancestry and how it would tie in to the rest of the adventure.  All of these questions were out there and I (and millions of others) were just dying to have them answered.  However\\, as I mentioned previously\\, the director Rian Johnson is known for playing with audiences' expectations.  This being known it's only natural to assume that the story would not go in the direction many people expected.  Fan Theorists would likely get more wrong than right in this film and in a way\\, that is EXACTLY what happened.  So - the verdict - was it successful?  Did it have the desired impact and is the Star Wars franchise going in a fresh new direction because of it?  Well\\, this now falls into the category of opinion and by now you can likely read countless blog posts to support both sides regarding how people feel about it.  At my last glance it would seem torn perfectly down the middle about it\\, which is actually an incredible feat in itself.  With that in consideration\\, here is my take on the subject.  As I said before\\, I EXPECTED a skillfully told continuation of the story.  Instead\\, I feel that I received something equivalent to a burning pile of garbage for a story.\\n\\nInitially\\, I felt the film was so bad that I believed it to truly be a mistake and that the director woefully failed in relaying vision.  Perhaps there were production problems?  Maybe some kind of a writer's strike that happened.  I grasped at reasons to believe that the story portrayed on-screen was just a complete accident\\, but then I was reminded by several friends that the director is known for shattering viewer expectations and even more convincing\\, there were several indicators in the film itself suggesting that the intent was to \\\"tear down\\\" what we know and rebuild from the ashes.  In fact\\, it was even in the main movie trailer - \\\"forget the past\\, let the past die\\\".  Unfortunately\\, the only thing I want to forget is the 2 hours of my life that I lost by seeing the film.  In a series that is known for it's ridiculously loyal fanbase and considered to be one of the most commercially successful ventures in the history of film\\, is forgetting the past a truly good mantra to have?  In my opinion no\\, but even IF you want to steer away from repeating the same boring stories over and over\\, I still can't understand why you would throw out the opportunity to continue on all the great stories that were staged in the Force Awakens.  Those stories should have been continued.  If you wanted to do something different you could continue them in a way that was unexpected\\, but that's not really what happened.  --- WARNING AGAIN SPOILERS---   Sure\\, some folks would say that they were continued in an unexpected way\\, but simply killing someone off (Supreme Leader Snoke) without flair or dramatics is bad story telling if they are supposed to be important.  No back story\\, no motives given - just death and that's game over.  Want to learn more about Rey's lineage? That's not important\\, she was just sold for drinking money...end of story.  Congratulations you waited 2 years for that.  Captain Phasma - what drives her?  How did she get to her rank and station?  What does she look like (even though we all know she's gorgeous under that mask) and why is she so hell bent on Finn - no just kill her too\\, but not without showing her eyeball.  Other great characters stories?  Finn and Poe - let's just toss them in the background and focus on brand new characters that we shoehorned in for...well...it's unexpected right?  These are just a few examples\\, but if \\\"unexpected\\\" or going in a new direction means bad or lack luster story telling then what is the purpose?\\n\\nThe problems don't really stop at just storytelling either.  Comedy is poorly written and horribly timed.  Luke Skywalker is written to either be a comedic goober or an outright coward depending on his scene.  Neither of which is characteristic of him.  If I think back to remember his iconic moments in the film I will forever recall that 1.) He milked an alien titty and 2.) He died\\, presumably because he exerted too much energy while titty milking.  The use of CG visuals was back in full force vs. what I thought was a tasteful callback to practical effects in The Force Awakens.  The sheer number of CG created cute animals was enough to make me sick\\, but the marketing teams at Disney have struck gold.  My sister visited Disney World weeks before the movie was released\\, and she can attest to the sheer volume of Porg plushies being sold a premium price.  I mean...who wouldn't want to own a cute little creature that is totally down with hanging out with you even though you murdered and ate his family.  Butchered my brother?  No problem\\, I'm just going to do a cute frowny face at you to make you feel guilty and then we can fly off together into space afterward.  If that wasn't enough animal cuteness you have the obnoxiously long space horse escape scene that contributes nothing to the plot at all.  You can also add in those over the top CG crystal foxes because I'm certain all of those will sell plushies nicely.  If you're tired of the cuteness though there are plenty of badass scenes to enjoy.  Like that one scene where Lea brings herself back to life in the vacuum of space and uses her force powers to fly to the ship - where they open the door and the vacuum of space ceases to exist and doesn't suffocate everyone in the room.  If you had forgot that Lea had force powers that's because you're not paying attention.  Force training isn't necessary anymore.\\n\\nI could go on with my gripes and nitpicks\\, but I highly doubt anyone has made it this far into my review.  Yes\\, initially I was just complaining\\, but I think this is long enough to call it a review and at least feel like I haven't wasted 20 minutes of my life just ranting about something.  I won't say that there are no redeemable qualities in the movie.  For example\\, I really loved Rey and Kylo Ren's story arc.  The emo \\\"force texting\\\" really drew me in and I kind of thought it was cool they had that kind of connection.  Also\\, imagine how much you could save on your data plan if you had that ability with your friends and family.  The small amount of lightsaber battling was decent enough\\, though I'm not really sure why Kylo Ren always has to draw his light saber the same way.  Saber down and foot stomp...then saber comes out.  It's sort of like he is a WWE character that has a trademark move he must use before every battle.  There were also a couple action sequences that were literally \\\"radical\\\".  I could tangibly feel the tension in the theater when the Star Destroyer was cut into several pieces\\, so kudos there.  Overall\\, there was some originality - but I think originality isn't great when it's uninspiring or boring.  Maybe in 2 years when the next episode comes out there will be some changes in story or revelations that change my mind about how this film played out\\, but until then I will have to mark Star Wars: The Last Jedi as the worst Star Wars film I have ever seen....but hey\\, that's just an opinion!","true":true}
