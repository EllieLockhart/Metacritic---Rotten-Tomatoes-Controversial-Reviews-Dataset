Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Rise of Skywalker is just mediocre and boring\\, but I'd take that any day over something that actively insults and frustrates me. This film has NO redeeming qualities\\, it's cringe fest all the way","true":true}
