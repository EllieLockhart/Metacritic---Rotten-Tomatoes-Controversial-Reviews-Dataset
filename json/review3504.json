Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars film since Jedi. Does a fine job parrying all the world building problems created by Force Awakens\\, builds on all the new characters\\, pays amazing homage to Star wars' Japanese pulp roots\\, visually stunning\\, exciting action and well thought out set pieces\\, perfectly choreographed. Great mix of original trilogy and new. Synthesizes the two worlds and consolidates the threads of the storylines so that the next one will have a clearer starting point. The unexpected and startling moments and story beats are a breathe of fresh air\\, and amazing for a series in its 9th film. What a universe indeed.","true":true}
