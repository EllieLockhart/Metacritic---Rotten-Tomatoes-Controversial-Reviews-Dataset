Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can accept rian's take on Luke's character and ever since Disney bought star wars I could accept the loss of expanded universe. But I feel like Rian Johnson stepped on the toes of everything that J. J. Abrams tried to set up and failed to coordinate with the efforts of all the other story team members regarding the newest video games and TV shows that Disney has produced. I feel that Kathleen Kenedy should be furious with Rian Johnson for not being a team player and FOR NOT WORKING WITH THE REST OF DISNEY'S STORY TEAM TO PROTECT CONTINUITY OF THE NEW CANON. \\n\\nIf this was a fan fiction or an independent artistic rendition of a star wars movie\\, then I would be happy to give it a good rating\\, but since this is a movie about the MAIN STAR WARS PLOT LINE\\, I feel that continuity should have been more prioritized. \\n\\nAlso they could have done entirely without Rose. She seemed pointless and took away from Finn's story. I feel like I will be forced to see her again in the next film.","true":true}
