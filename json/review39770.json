Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a movie without a plot. Without character development. It has no heart\\, despite featuring characters that many fans are very emotionally invested in. The storyline is so disorganized and fractured it watches like it was created by a committee\\, with each scene focus-group tested. The characters feel flimsy and both the First Order and the Resistance seem so hopeless inept and seemingly without any motivation. Instead of creating a compelling story the director choses to rely on special effects--it's incredibly lazy filmmaking. It's like eating junk food that makes you feel full for a short while\\, but is ultimately unsatisfying.","true":true}
