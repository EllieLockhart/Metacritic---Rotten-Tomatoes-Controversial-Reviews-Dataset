Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The biggest disappointment in my gaming years.\rThe Last of Us is one of my favorite games of all time. I really like the games from Naughty Dog so there is no hate towards the company neither Neil Druckmann. BUT! I CAN'T STAND THE FAKE MARKETING YOU DID WITH THIS GAME. That was a low-punch to the fans of the series and should be penalized in some way.\rStory was so forced and unenjoyable. They relayed on cheap \\\"shock factor\\\" moments that became more of a meme at times.\rGameplay was brutal. But did not innovate that much from the first game\\, but still! is fun as hell! The graphics and scenery are beautiful! Best I have seen in years.\rSound design was top notch too.\rThe lack of new infected is just sad. I really feel they could have created more of them\\, but no. We get a couple new ones and a boss. (That boss fight was particularly good)\rSecondary characters are forgettable and you do not get to connect with them at all. The ones coming from the first game do not act like them anymore and that will infuriate you if you are a fan of the 1st game.\rI get that they tried \\\"something different\\\" but in this case it didn't worked at all. It felt more of a chore to start my PS4 and continue with the game.\rIt's sad that the characters from the first one are left with nothing. Their character development was thrown into the trash in exchange of the new ones.\rI cannot recommend this game at all if you're a fan of TLOU1. It will be a waste of $60.\rTLOU is a story-driven game. And when the story is that bad\\, you can't put a good mark on it even if the gameplay\/sound design\/scenery are incredible.\r\rHope to never see part 3.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
