Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The hype can make some people feel a little let down - but just fans of Star Wars (not the nitpick crowd) and I am sure kids who are newer to the series will enjoy it\\, a lot.\\nEmpire Strikes Back is always my favorite which may be due to nostalgia\\, and it was a great movie.  The Last Jedi has a lot of story to tell\\, to wrap up and to set the stage for the new SW fans.  These movies are for kids - us adults who have been fans our whole life need to jump on boaord and enjoy the new generation of SW.  I was able to do that quite easily.  \\nI do understand some of the negativity to some small random insertions during the movie\\, that were not grown or explained\\, but that is how new characters are introduced.\\nGood movie - just different for long time fans.  100% go see this movie.","true":true}
