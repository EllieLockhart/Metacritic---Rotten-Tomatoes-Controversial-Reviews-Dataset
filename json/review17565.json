Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it different? Yes\\, definitely. Was it good? Yes\\, absolutely. I've loved Star Wars all my life. The old EU books\\, comics and games\\, all of it. This is not the old Star Wars. It's the new one\\, and it was fantastic.","true":true}
