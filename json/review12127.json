Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge star wars fan and i always have been\\, however i felt this movie didn't do justice to so many characters and their legacies. Didn't enjoy the subplot at all and felt as if it didn't expand off of much of the force awakens i have watched it twice yet still don't understand the reasoning behind many characters actions.","true":true}
