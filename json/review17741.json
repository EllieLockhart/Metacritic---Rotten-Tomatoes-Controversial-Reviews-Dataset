Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It did feel overly long\\, but it's difficult to know what to cut out because I liked it so much. It was much more original then TFA\\, and\\, SPOILER ALERT:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am so glad Rey and Kylo (Ben) aren't twins!!!! :D The whole theater cheered at that when I watche it.","true":true}
