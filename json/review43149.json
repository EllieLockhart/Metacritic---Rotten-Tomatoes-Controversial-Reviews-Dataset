{"101487":187385,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review contains spoilers so beware if you are going to read further.\\n\\nRian delivers a story that is unexpected but wrong\\, not right. It acts as anthology movie rather than part of trilogy. In the beginning of the movie Luke throws away the lightsaber Rey gives him. It is kind of symbolic to what this movie does to previous 8 movies. (counting Rogue One).\\n\\nRian throws away established mythology by George Lucas\\, destroys Luke Skywalker character\\, ignores JJ Abrams' afford in Ep VII to create new mysteries and evolve stories that had potential in Ep VIII. The movie has lot of plot holes and it misses logic here and there. \\n\\nThe movie showed that nobody needs to train to be master of the Jedi craft. To use force\\, to swing lightsaber as a pro\\, to know how to swim even though you lived on the desert planet your whole life. Rian simply ignores George fundamentals of to be a Jedi and use the force one needs to take a lot of training to be one. \\n\\nWhat is wrong:\\n\\nRey - without training happen to master Jedi craft within a week counting EP VII too.  \\nPhasma - wasted potential and underused character.\\nRose and Finn subplot - takes too long\\, un-logical\\nLea - a scene where we discovers she knows and uses the force is straight Superman scene. You can believe Superman but you will not believe Lea here. It does not feel right.\\nAdmiral Holdo - shady character to be revealed she had plan all the time. I love the scene where she lightspeed through the First Order fleet.\\nThe First Order - chasing few ships like they can not take out all those ships with fighters.\\n\\nLuke - Mark Hamill delivers the best performance here and he himself does not agree with this Luke. Luke is broken and turns his back on his sister\\, Chewie\\, dead Han and the dying good??? Really??? This is not Luke we know and it does not make sense. His self exile should have served a better purpose. We could have seen the best Luke\\, have further knowledge of Jedi history\\, discover their training and see how Luke manages to find a new way how to train Jedi and kind of fix the problems Jedi had during their time. Instead we get this Luke that in the end decides to once again \\\"save\\\" rebellion without telling Poe and others to go I will hold them off. It takes Poe to realise what Luke is up to???\\n\\nSnoke - lot of questions unanswered\\, wasted potential\\, mysterious character that could have shown more of his powers. Nobody explains him where he comes from how he changed Ben to Kylo. We haven't even seen his training Snoke pointed in the end of EPVII. Yet I love the betrayal scene. That was epic and right.\\n\\nThe final act and battle is not a battle as it turns out. Luke just shows and hold off Kylo. Instead coming in his X-Wing\\, cause some damage to walkers and help get rest of Resistance now Rebellion again on the Falcon. Since Carrie Fisher passed away it would make more sense for him to be in the EP IX alive and help build the Rebellion. Here reshoots should have been made. \\n\\nHumour in this movie is overdone and not humorous in some scenes like Finn waking up\\, Hux and Poe chat taking too long\\,  It is really forced and opening battle where the asian girl is kicking the ladder to drop the button... the whole heavy bombers feel wrong. It would be really dark movie if it has less forced humour and went to the mind of dark lord and showed some Kylo Ren meditation to Vader or some of that as we have not seen it in any movie before.\\n\\nThis could have been a lot better logical movie and the best Star Wars movie if it explored more of light and dark side of the force and mythology\\, showed mastered Luke Skywalker training Rey in new ways returning as Master and Padawan. Better explaining how Snoke was influencing Kylo and turning him to the Dark Side and explaining how the First Order came back from the ashes of Empire and where is Snoke from and how he is so strong with the force. Who was Max Von Sydow and why he has the map. Why R2D2 woke up from the hibernation mode at the moment as he did and showed the larger map? It all could have had a higher better meaning as it created a huge potential. \\n\\nNo\\, simply no. The director just throws it away. Sad you cant throw away EP VIII. Critics love it fans are divided by it. If you ask me why are fans divided I would say it is because those who did not like the movie were the ones like Mark Hamill kind of guys and others were more mediocre average Star Wars fans who just do not care that much about all that Star Wars is.\\n\\nWhat was good:\\nFalcon fighting TIE fighters\\, Kylo Ren\\, Porgs\\, Chewie\\, Lea\\, Poe\\, Holdo's sacrifice\\, Phasma vs Finn\\, DJ\\, C3PO\\, visual and sound effects\\, excellent soundtrack by John Williams far better than EP VII.\\n\\nPS: Look at all the explaining Rian Johnson had to do after the movie was released. The movie is bad as sequel and Star Wars movie. What Rian did with this movie is catastrophic as it does not respect George mythology and foundations of Star Wars universe of Jedi\\, Sith\\, force and JJ Abrams' effort. Yet the movie is a good quality visually and atmospherically. I believe his own trilogy would make more sense rather than this movie.","true":true}
