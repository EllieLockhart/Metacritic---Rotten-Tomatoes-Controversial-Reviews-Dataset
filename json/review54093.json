Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t get the hate! Since many people are signing in for first time i want to do that as well which is how much i liked this film ...this is the best Star Wars since empire and dare I say it better... it is more real and raw but still whimsical and comforting\\, intimate acting in a grand setting\\,but still endearing and hopeful at the same time...and yes i would have stayed for 2 more hours if there was more story to tell...wow maybe the duality in the reviews was planned due to the duality in this film that is perfectly balanced just like the force!
