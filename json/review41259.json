Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolutely terrible. The story is clunky\\, soooooo many cheesy jokes\\, the dialog has too many stupid lines\\, there are a lot of unnecessary scenes.\\n\\nThe characters are not developed\\, the main villain is useless\\, certain characters should have died\\, others should have continued on. \\n\\nThere is little  explanation as to why Luke is in hiding\\, why he won't train her\\, and why he decides to help again.\\n\\nThis movie is going to receive rave reviews from non true star wars fans\\, however all who are true fans should be pissed that the director will be given his own trilogy!","true":true}
