Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most disrespectful\\, careless and sad Star Wars movie ever made... It didn't answer anything. If The Force Awakens left us with plenty of questions. The Last Jedi not only doesn't answer them\\, but tells us that our questions didn't matter at all. The classic characters are all minimized\\, lost their elegance and pride\\, if past characters are supposed to give their place to new characters\\, then why don't let them go with the chin up\\, fighting\\, saving the day... the movie made me sick and I wish there was negative stars to rate it... Painful to watch. The plot was poorly articulated and extremely long. There are no light saber fights in this movie... The new characters were supposed to learn from the old ones\\, this didn't happen we have goofy new weak characters and the classic characters are now gone... No way back from this mess. Disney please stay away from Game of Thrones.","true":true}
