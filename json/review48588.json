Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse than being a bad film\\, it's a boring film. Plot lines go nowhere and the whole thing is a dull drudge. From the slowest ever space chase in history to an entirely superfluous section on some casino world\\, this is a tedious bore of a film. New characters add nothing to the plot and the whole 'subversion of expectations' happens so frequently\\, it's painful to watch unfold. Now that episode 9 is out\\, the last jedi is even more of a painful waste of screen time and a terrible disappointment.","true":true}
