Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie's core was that the old must die for the new to survive\\, that no matter how well natured your intention may be\\, if you refuse to grow and take lessons from your past you'll just repeat it.\\n\\nTFA was a movie of repeated choices. The old generation of the Skywalker saga tried to remake the republic after the empire fell. Luke tried to make the Jedi again in the way he learned of them and Leia helped for the senate again. However\\, the resentment of the fall of the empire and the loss of power of the humans of that empire grew into a grass root militia movement\\, the First Order. Branded a rebellion because it fought the established order\\, it really just copied the previous tactics of the horrible ruling force.\\n\\nSnoke came about\\, in my mind\\, as a reaction to Luke's rebuilding the Jedi. I have a theory that the force plays a more active role in events than we think and it creates balance\\, if you have too much light it creates dark or if you have too much dark it creates light. It finds a opposition\\, a balance.\\n\\nSnoke was to fight Luke's light\\, but in this movie when Snoke died\\, Luke's light wasn't needed anymore. What we're left with is Kylo's grey and Rey's grey. Both volatile and balanced more than the previous but dancing back and forth between \\\"sides\\\". I think Kylo's arc in the movie really is the striving for a new future that he himself defined but it's ironic because we know he is just copying his grandfather more than he knows but only now that's he's not trying.\\n\\nThe other arc is the resistance\\, the group of rebels who need to now define themselves. They have a loose structure and wonton heroism defined them before but now they fall victim to greater numbers and power on show that they can't afford to rush into battle\\, but they don't know how to fight with purpose and intelligence. Poe needs to learn that he alone can't save the resistance with crazy tricks\\, that sacrifice for a single victory does not win the war. So much of old Star Wars was a single sacrifice\\, a single death or death of a squadron to stop a killing machine. But we see in this that it's not okay\\, it takes a toll and can defeated them.\\nSteven\\nI think this movie takes the tropes of the Original trilogy and the Prequels and plays with them\\, and turns on them. It takes what you expect from the old movie and flips that expectation encapsulated in the ironing scene where you think it's a ship but it's just an iron! \\n\\nStar Wars has always been silly humour\\, and slapstick\\, it's always have high morals and weird creatures. We just kind of forgot that in the now where we want all our childhood intellectual properties to have matured like we did. But honesty\\, I loved the fluffiness.","true":true}
