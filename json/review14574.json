Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a huge Star Wars fan since I was a kid. I love the original trilogy and the prequels were adequate. This movie\\, however\\, was a disaster from start to finish. It felt like Rian Johnson had never seen a single SW movie including The Force Awakens. Kathleen Kennedy clearly doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t understand the source material or how to run a company (as evidenced by her constant director changes and reshoots). This movie was so awful that it ruined Star Wars for me. I skipped Solo and have no intentions of seeing Ep. IX.","true":true}
