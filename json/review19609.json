Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It very much feels like a sequel to Ep VII\\, the inclusion of way more Mark Hammill is gladly welcomed\\, and the comedy & action are more biting than its arguably too-family-friendly predecessor. However\\, the logic & context for many crucial plot points are relegated to brief or nonexistant explanation. Be it for runtime or mere haste\\, the story plays out like large swaths of development have been removed. Character motivations & battle progressions suffer noticably because of this. Still\\, I'm left excited for new Ep IX possibilities that we'll see come to fruition in two years. B-","true":true}
