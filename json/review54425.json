Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked The Force Awakens\\, even though it was a play by play rehash of A New Hope. I did not like The Last Jedi. Luke's character is totally wasted\\, as is the entire Fin\/Rose sub plot. Many plot points from the Force Awakens are entirely abandoned\\, leaving me uninterested for the next installment. The Force Awakens left me feeling excited for the future of Starwars. This film made me feel like there is no future for starwars.","true":true}
