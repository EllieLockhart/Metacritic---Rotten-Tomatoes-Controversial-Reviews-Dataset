Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"no decent saber fights. useless character arcs. bad romance arc. killed snoke off for nothing. characters aren't grey enough. luke is acting out of character. logic failures everywhere. lightspeed suicide ships changes everything (like why do you even need a deathstar\\, just lightspeed ships into a planet?).  rey's character didnt go anywhere. etc etc. Just bad storytelling all round.","true":true}
