Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is direct insult to fans. It appears that instead of a real story they had a PC checklist of \\\"events\\\" Finn and Rose's arc was a complete waste of time with no real connection. Rey is perfect at everything\\, all the time. Bizarro Luke does and says things that are the complete antithesis of everything he stood for. That's not darkness... it's simply lazy storytelling. Rian Johnson should never be let near Star Wars again.","true":true}
