Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in the movie it feels more like a political agenda movie than an actual Sci-fi fantasy movie\\, I been a long time star wars fan and I feel this totally destroys George Lucas vision for the movies. The ridiculous jokes that feel way out of place to the point of too many useless characters like Rose and Holdo a whole pointless part of Canto Bight. This movie is nothing more than a Feminist propaganda movie with massive amounts of Mary Sue characters that are shallow. This movie really is beyond garbage and i won't be following anything Disney will be doing with the Franchise.","true":true}
