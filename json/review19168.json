Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just so good. I was really worried about this film ruining everything set up in The Force Awakens\\, but this film just nailed. It wasn't predictable. The throne room scene is the best moment in Star Was history. Just an amazing sequence. There are so many great moments for old fans. R2's moment with Luke and of course Yoda. BRAVO!","true":true}
