Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"dESPITE WORD OF MOUTH NOT BEING GREAT ON THIS MOVIE i DID FINNALY SEE IT.  i WAITED FOR THE bLU rAY AND MUST SAY IT HAS EARNED IT'S BAD REVIEW.  rIAN jOHNSON FAILED THE STAR WARS FANS WITH HIS TAKE ON THE SAGA\\, EVEN WITH THE BASICS OF THE SERIES.  bROKE TRADITION AND HAD bb 8 SAY THE LINE \\\"i HAVEA A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS\\\".  NEXT MADE LUKE A GRUMPY BROKEN MAN\\, AND FINALLY RAY LEARNS THE FORCE WITH NO TRAINING.  tHE CANTO BIGHT SCENE IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME\\, AND THE CHARACTER ROSE IS JUST ANOYNING.  THIS AS ALWAYS BEEN THE SKYWALKER SAGA\\, AND IT SEEMS KATHLEEN KENNEDY IS DETERMINED TO DESTROY THAT.  THIS MOVIE MAKES THE PHANTOM MENECE LOOK EPIC AND I AM SURE I AM NOT ALONE IN MISSING GEORGE LUCAS.  i WILL NOT WATCH OR SUPPORT JOHNSON IN FUTURE PROJECTS\\, NOT SURE IF THEY STAY ON THIS COURSE I CAN SAY I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STAR WARS.","true":true}
