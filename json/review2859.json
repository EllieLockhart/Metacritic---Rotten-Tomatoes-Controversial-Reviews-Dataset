Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful Star Wars movie. Kathleen Kennedy and Ruin Johnson should not be allowed anywhere near another Star Wars movie ever. This isn't even Star Wars. This is an agenda driven\\, nihilistic\\, post modern crap that tried to be way too subversive and did not work within the framework of even the new trilogy as set up by JJ Abrams\\, much less 40 years of lore and story telling. Characters regress while others are downright assassinated and other still serve no purpose. The writing was bad\\, the story was bad and it left me gutted after being so excited about it\\, like every other Star Wars movie and series. They should help Kennedy find the door and promote someone who gets it to Head of Lucasfilm\\, like Dave Filoni.","true":true}
