Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why does Yoda talk so much?? Why would Luke be so angry\\, as if he hasn't mastered the Buddhist-like Zen of all the other Jedi masters before him?? Why is the movie so Marvel-esque quippy?? Since when in the hell was Star Wars quippy?? Was it better than Force Awakens? Yes. But is that saying much? No.","true":true}
