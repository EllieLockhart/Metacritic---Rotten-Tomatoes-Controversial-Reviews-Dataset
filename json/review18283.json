Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was fantastic! It came from a totally different perspective than any other Star Wars movie in existence. It is definitely one of the most important movies of the franchise. TLJ provides a place for children and a younger generation to look up to people that respect and care for one another even though they disagree\\, which is something that can arguably be a big problem in today's society. I loved TLJ and definitely understand how the new generation of Star Wars fans could love and do need this movie.","true":true}
