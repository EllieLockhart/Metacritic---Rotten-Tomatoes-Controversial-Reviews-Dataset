The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us 2 is the greatest game of this generation so far.It's also the most polarising. This generation has been underwhelming to me with the 2 exceptions of the Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2\\, everything wasn't that much of a giant leap from the last console gen. My most played and my favourite game of all time is TES5: Skyrim\\, a last gen game\\, I'm still playing this gen.TLOU2 challenges gamers by killing off a central character in a gruesome fashion\\, very Game of Thrones esque. Sets you up to play as the antagonist to see their perspective and motivations. With the ending\\, leaving us with no winners at the of this game. This goes against the grain\\, against video game norms\\, it's very Leftfield. In video games we're used to being the heroes and saving the world. In this\\, you're forced accept the opposite and to make matters worse you have no choice in any of the decisions the characters choose.I did not look at any leaks\\, news\\, gossip\\, rumour and bought it day 1\\, played it through out the week and avoided social media for spoilers until completion. I was fully immersed and engaged with the story end to end.I couldn't put it down.I went in with high expectations and it significantly exceeded them.My life was on hold to play and complete this game. It was sad\\, it moved me and I still think about it.I enjoyed so much\\, I want to play it again but I need to get on with my life. This is an easy clear cut 10 out of 10 game for me.Just like it's predecessor\\, no other medium\\, let alone a game has moved me this much emotionally. In fact a lot of gamers are very emotional right now about this game for various reasons.This is without a shadow of doubt\\, the best game I've ever played. I have to commend Naughty Dog\\, for pushing the video game industry forward yet again and I'm looking forward to what they have in store for us next.This is an instant classic and must buy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
