Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an excellent continuation of the new trilogy and adds more depth to the existing lore and mythology. Performances are fantastic throughout. Big fan of Mark Hamill's performance here\\, say what you want about  'destroying childhoods' but his performance is undeniably brilliant and I for one really enjoyed seeing Luke's struggle and it made complete sense given the context.","true":true}
