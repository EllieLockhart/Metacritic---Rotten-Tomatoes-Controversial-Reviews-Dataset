Only real issue for me was the length and pacing - I clocked just under 25hrs\\, and felt that it dragged a bit in places\\, and has several false starts as far as the final 5 or so hours are concerned.

Other than that\\, it plays wonderfully; the combat has been massively streamlined since the first game\\, where I often felt the combat was a bit of a chore. Obviously the game looks great\\, and the acting is top notch. While the first game focused on the relationships between a small handful of characters\\, Part 2 explores the wider world of The Last of Us\\, giving the player an interesting insight into how the rest of the country is coping (or not...). This is occasionally a detriment to character development\\, as we are introduced to so many new faces\\, but nonetheless I found the overarching story to be an enthralling rollercoaster of a journey. While it can\u2019t quite match the simplicity and intimacy of the first game\\, it succeeds in telling a challenging story\\, and opens up a world of possibilities as far as any potential sequel is concerned.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
