Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only did this movie ignore and crap on the character development\\, lore and plot devices of the six first films... It managed to do the same with the first film of its own trilogy..  Horrible plot\\, directing and editing has made this dumpster fire of a film not only the worst star wars movie ever\\, it's not even a good science fiction movie...   Disney may have actually killed Star Wars...","true":true}
