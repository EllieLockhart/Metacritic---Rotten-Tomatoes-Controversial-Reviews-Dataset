Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its fault is that it's not great. There is too much going on. I like a lot of the plot devices but I felt the movie was following too many characters or arcs. \\\"That's impossible!\\\" Every scene felt like it was plugged with one liners. Some of them were good but they lose their impact as other one liners would take its place above it. My main criticism of the movie is that it was more of a war film than a movie about the Skywalker family. Some of the scenes were brilliant but put together as a whole film\\, it unfortunately the story telling falls flat and feels underwhelming.","true":true}
