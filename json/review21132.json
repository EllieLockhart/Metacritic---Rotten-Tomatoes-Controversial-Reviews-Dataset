Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was ten in 1977.  every new star wars film released I saw in cinemas five to ten times and purchased the home video (from vhs to dvd to blu) the day of release.   not 'The Last jedi'.  saw the opening night fan event\\, walked out of the cinema so disgusted and disappointed I never wanted to see it again\\, let alone own it.  I did see it one more time on home video at a friend's house and I could barely get through it.  everything set up in seven\\, rJ tore down in eight.  I cannot believe that no one at Disney\\, no one at lucasfilm\\, nobody who saw this film before it was released to the public said\\, \\\"This is a horrifically disjointed mess of a film and it's awful.\\\"  So many pointless scenes\\, so much wasted time\\, so many plot holes\\, such bad character development\\, horrible writing\\, no arc for this film itself or its place in the new trilogy.  the worst part of leaving the cinema after 'tlj' was not caring one iota what happens in part nine.  Eight made too much of a mess to clean up.","true":true}
