Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The greatest pleasure in watching a Star Wars movie is the discovery that the characters have a greater significance to the overall story than just the adventures we experience with them. This movie totally disregards this & gives the impression that there is no greater story at play here; the questions that are set up in the previous movie are completely dismissed\\, & the characters that we've just newly become invested in are somewhat set aside as we're now encouraged to become invested in some nameless & anonymous children by the movie's end. Traditionally Star Wars is visually dynamic\\, but by contrast\\, the drama in this movie is often visually dull. Rather than any sense of vigour of visual dynamism\\, the movie's opening conflict begins with one completely motionless spaceship facing another completely motionless spaceship\\, stock still in space - how undynamic. The movie's climax is heralded by a row of more motionless vehicles\\, standing completely still facing a wall\\, while the main \\\"thrust\\\" of the story concerns the resistance not exactly being chased through space\\, so much as being leisurely followed from a distance. It seems baffling to me that a writer\/director would actively WANT to construct a Star Wars movie around such a lack of visual thrill. As a Star Wars movie\\, this is an unfortunate misdirection of the franchise in my view.","true":true}
