Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing film. After all the goodwill that The Force Awakens brought back to Star Wars\\, this movie basically ignores everything established and does its own thing. There are good parts\\, but the middle drags forever with the pointless casino subplot. The ending somewhat makes up for it\\, but overall it left a bad taste in my mouth. I just hope Episode IX can redeem the series.","true":true}
