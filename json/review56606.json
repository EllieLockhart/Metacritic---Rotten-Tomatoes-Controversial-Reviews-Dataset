Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film played more like a critique of Star Wars than a genuine Star Wars movie\\, and while I understand that a film could be both\\, I don't believe Last Jedi succeeds.  Like most modern superhero movies\\, anything can be destroyed and anyone can be killed with little fanfare or emotional impact.  Things blow up and the cast moves on without really looking back.  Nothing is ever really at stake.  This felt more like a Harry Potter or Hunger Games movie than Star Wars.  The story effectively killed any interest I have in where these characters are going\\, and I may very well not see any subsequent installments.","true":true}
