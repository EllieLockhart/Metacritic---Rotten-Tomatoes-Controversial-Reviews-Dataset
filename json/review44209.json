Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tons of plotholes\\, bad setup\\, useless plot archs that don't deilver and characters that are inconsistent about well-known and stablished characters in the series. Will entertain kids that still see Disney Channel. For Star Wars lovers\\, Star Wars ended in Epsiode VI.","true":true}
