Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been watching star wars since i was 5 and this was god awful. Plot hokes everywgere. The actors for fin and the asian chick were horrible. Leia was horrible\\, leia's death and coming back was ridiculius. Snoke had no backstpry. None kf the plot fits at all. A complete atrocity of a movie.","true":true}
