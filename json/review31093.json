Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I was extra disappointed with the new Star Wars flick. SPOILER ALERT: they made Chewbacca vegan. That\\, and many other eye rolling moments had me looking at everyone else like \u0093fam\\, what is this shit??\u0094 and then folks looking back like ????????????????????????????. Nobody had the answers Sway. But I was hyped since all the critic reviews were positive and fellow online nerds were pleased. Which further reinforces my belief\/fact that people really just recycle popular opinion. The feeling in the theater was odd like only one person clapped at the end. I remember experiencing something like this for the third Christopher Nolan Batman flick.","true":true}
