Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see this opening night in the UK yesterday - been looking forward to this ever since The Force Awakens. In the trailers it was claimed \\\"This will not go the way you think\\\" and they were right. Sadly.\\n\\nCharacterisation for pretty much all the characters was way off what has gone before - I felt that Mark Hamill did the best job he could with what he had. There were too few scenes with Luke and Rey\\, the latter yet again being written as the character-who-can-do-anything-because-she's-just-that-good which kills any sort of tension or drama. There were also far too many jokes\\, which made some characters like General Hux little more than comic relief.\\n\\nFor me\\, TLJ trampled on so much without paying any heed or respect for what has gone before - that's not drama\\, it's bad writing and plotting. The film as a whole felt kind of empty\\, sometimes pointless\\, which I had to reflect in the score. The set-up done by The Force Awakens was wasted here\\, which is a shame.","true":true}
