Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has moments so cringe-worthy that it makes Jar Jar look like Daniel Day Lewis in the prequels. \\n\\nI honestly couldn't believe what I was watching\\, besides two or three well-crafted sequences near the middle\/end\\, this movie was a scrambled mess. \\n\\nRian wouldn't let a single moment of drama sink in without immediately ruining it with a cheap joke. There was no room suspense and no depth or character development\\, just lazy writing and terrible structure.\\n\\nUnfortunately it's not just a bad Star Wars movie; it's a legitimately poorly made film.\\n\\nIt came off more as a parody of star wars than an actual star wars...I'm still letting it all sink in.\\n\\nI feel bad posting negative comments online as I know what \\\"troll\\\" culture has become...but\\, I mean\\, this is just bad.","true":true}
