Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**Free of Spoilers**.\\nThe magic is gone. Long gone..I consider myself a fan of Star Wars\\, not a hardcore\\, zealot-like \\\"fan\\\" who can tolerate no criticism of anything that has the name Star Wars on it but as someone who realy loved this sci-fi saga and its heroes. After being somewhat dissapointed with TFA but rather satisfied with Rogue One I went to the movies without realy knowing what to expect. But such a dissapointment I certainly did not. \\n\\nSomeone should tell the Disney people-if they actually care about producing films that classify as art and not as mindless entertainment for the masses meant to be forgotten in a few weeks time-that the art of filmaking is much more than good special effects. \\n\\nShowing respect to the material is paramount when delaing with a story that spans for generations-in real life as well as in the fictional setting of SW. Showing respect to the characters\\, having them act in a way consistent with their nature\\, is essential to any good form of storytelling. Plot holes can be tolerated-unless of course it is only them that consitute what passes as a plot. \\n\\nThis movie lacks a soul-and for any work of art that is the greatest anathema.\\n\\nTo sum up-DO NOT SEE THIS if you have any respect to what remotely good filmaking is or you loved Star Wars at any point in your life.","true":true}
