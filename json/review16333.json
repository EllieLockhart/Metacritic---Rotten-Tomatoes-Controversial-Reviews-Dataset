Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not surprised the 'nutters' have slagged this latest episode off.  By nutters\\, I mean those that genuinely believe the Star Wars film franchise is akin to a religion and its sacred texts cannot be violated.\\nThis film moves the series on and provides the opportunity for a believeable next step.  It moves at pace\\, great action sequences\\, some good light hearted sections and yes\\, there are some confused moments and some that are difficult to reason.  However\\, it is called science FICTION for a reason people.  Whenever one steps over the threshold of the cinema or theatre\\, one is required to have a willing sense of disbelief to make any story work.  This is no more so true than in a film series such as this. Greatly entertained and am laughing at those poor souls who are outraged.","true":true}
