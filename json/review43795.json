Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars yet the only thing that kept it alive was Chewbacca and the Porgs other then that they butchered Luke Skywalker and had way to many loop holes that didn\u2019t make sense. Also there were to many weird awkward jokes that just popped up out of no where at serious moments. Please don\u2019t let this director make another Star Wars movie again. apparently you can\u2019t trust the critics they must be getting payed off by Disney to be giving this movie such great reviews verses the users which are pooping on this movie. If you don\u2019t care about the past Star Wars movies then you should go see this\\, other then that you would be better off watching YouTube videos of people reacting Star Wars fan fiction.","true":true}
