Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I take it all back\\, George Lucas. The prequels are better. I would rather sit through a Jar Jar Binks movie than watch this steaming pile of crap again.\\n\\nThe editing of the movie is horrible. It felt like 15 different movies spliced together. Many times I thought the film was drawing to an end only to have it NOT end. CGI is wonky and took me out of the film several times. Such a shame because ILM's work is usually top-notch.","true":true}
