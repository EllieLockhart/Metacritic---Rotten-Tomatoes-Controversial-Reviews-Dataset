Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics got this one over the fans. I don't get what all the complains are about. I'm a Star Wars fan who completely enjoyed the movie. Just expected better fight scenes\\, but there are a few I can't forget about. Story of Luke Skywalker and the focus on new characters are well done. It's just excitement all around. I'm just looking forward to watch it again and  you get a new dimension to Kylo Ren's character\\, and it was quite remarkable.","true":true}
