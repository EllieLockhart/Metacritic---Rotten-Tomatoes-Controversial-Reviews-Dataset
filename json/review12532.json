Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe how bad this movie was. I've been a huge Star Wars fan since I was 6\\, and this movie was horrible. The characters we've come to love are exploited in what is essentially creative expression gone wild. It ignores established character traits\\, and attempts to create emotionally charged connections with new characters we don't even hear speak. Creating very awkward distractions. Star Wars has always tweaked the laws of physics to a certain extent\\, but the opening battle is ridiculously over the top. Not to mention the first orders ridiculously poor performance. Worst yet the plot try's to reference today's political atmosphere in not so subtle references to feminism\\, racism\\, and Marxist references to social inequality. An all to familiar pattern now of the bad white men was quite oblivious. The only exception (Poe) essentially acting like a child who won't listen to his mothers. That is when he wasn't killing everyone by himself. Seriously it was like watching someone play Mario cart at times. I'm going to try and forget this movie was ever made.","true":true}
