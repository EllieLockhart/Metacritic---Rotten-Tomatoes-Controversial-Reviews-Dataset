Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film honestly. Long time fan of the franchise and all the petty things the \\\"fans\\\" complain about make me love it even more. Maybe 1 or 2 scenes I disliked but overall in my top Star Wars movies. Very unexpected and breathtaking.","true":true}
