Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson demolished the Star Wars legacy in a manner\\, I never thought possible! What a terrible take on one of the most precious franchises and a true killer of fond childhood memories. Worst Star Wars movie in any possible sense. Wont watch anything Rian Johnson touches in the future.","true":true}
