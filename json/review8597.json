{"101487":121360,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off it took two years for them to put this 2 1\/2 hrs space chase together... First 15 mins awesome. Then an hour of drag and useless story which could have been Luke and Rey but no. Then 15 mins with Luke good. Then 15 mins of WTF NO back story on SNOKE. The mutiny was cool then so much wasted time. Did I really check my watch again to see how much longer is left then 10 mins of pure awesomeness at the end. JJ ABRAMS is ruining Star Wars and the way he did this new Star Trek timeline. If the ninth movie sucks the way this one and seven did. In my mind it will only be 1-6. Hope Disney listens to there fans when we say this was a pile of nerf crap. ","true":true}
