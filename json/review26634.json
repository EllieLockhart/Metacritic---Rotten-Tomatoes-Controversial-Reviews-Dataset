{"101487":158995,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-28","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, where to start?\\n1.\tThe first 1  1\/2 hours felt like they tried to fit 2 Hours of Spaceballs into the movie: to many jokes that that\\, to many stupid punch lines. Anoying\\n2.\tScore: uh was that bad.\\n3.\tStory: where to begin?\\na.\tThat stupid and useless sideplot destroyed the only decent Character (Finn) for TFA\\nb.\tLeia flying in Space without a Spacesuit\\, what dit the secreenwriter smoke? She should have died. Making force users able to live and move in Space is a stupid idea!\\nc.\tHyperspacing into Ships: cool effect\\, but why did the Rebellion didn't do that with the Death Stars? Droid controlled Frigate hyperspacing into Death Star(s) and not one Rebel life is endangered. Deus ex machina Screenwriting? Alway a bat thing\\nd.\tLuke Skywalker giving up his complete ideology and leaving the galaxy high and dry? Who wrote that crap?\\ne.\tWhy does the Resistance exist in the first place? Why weren't all oft hem part oft he new Republic (which actually existed) ... okay\\, that is mainly a dumb thing of TFA\\, but it contuinued to this movie\\nf.\tSlow speed chase: why didn't the Empir... ah ... New Order just call for more ships to cut into the Resistances way? Or just jumped in front oft them? Instead they chased them for weeks (remember: Finn and Rose went t that lenghty\\, useless sidequest)\\n4.\tCharacters\\na.\tKylo Ren: still as intimidating as Lord Dark Helmet. And\\, by the way: Ben ist he Name oft he son of Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker\\, the Kinds of Han and Leia are Jacen\\, Jaina and Anakin!\\nb.\tGeneral Hux: still a bad Josef G\u00f6bbels Joke\\nc.\tChewbacca: he should have eaten all of those anoyying furballs ... what purpose did they have in that movie (except for merchandise)\\nd.\tBalldroid: still a stupid and anoyying idea ... by the way: why does it have a coinslot and how many coins can he store? And who came tot he idea repairing something punching ist head into a wiring board and causing a whole bunch of shorts? Hte whole damn X-Wing should have explodet after that stupid droid did that (sorry\\, electrical engineer speaking ... tha whole thing was stupid)\\n5.\tOriginal Trilogy: everything that happened in the original trilogy has been made irrelevant with Last Jedi (and TFA)\\, except fort he meeting of Han and Leia \\n\\nI believe\\, that I forgot stuff (a lot)\\, but this covers the most stupid things.\\nI like Disney\\, I love what Marvel does under the cover of Disney\\, but Lucasfilm ... sorry\\, Luicasfilm went for me from one oft he best studios to one oft he worse:\\n-\tBad Characters\\n-\tBad Continuity\\n-\tBad (and lazy) Screenwriting\\n-\tBad Story\\nAll in all: Last Jedi is in my opinion the second worse Star Wars Movie\\,the only one worse ist he force awakens (Yes\\, I thing\\, that A Phantom Menance\\\" was much\\, much better than Ep VII and Ep. VIII copmbined ..\\, and Ep.I wasn't even a good movie)","true":true}
