Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a piece of crap. Saw it a few times\\, it keeps getting worse. Should have hired silent Bob. Watch his reweiw on youtube.  Kathleen Kennedy i hate you. I can't believe how bad this movie is and what they did to the legend of Luke Skywalker.  I think Disney should fire these idiots and say just kidding and start over","true":true}
