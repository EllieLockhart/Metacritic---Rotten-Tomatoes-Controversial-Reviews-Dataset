Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is for those who love to be divided on a topic. If you watch this movie after watching every other Star Wars movie\\, you will feel polarised. This whole movie was a subversion of the feel of Star Wars. This movie's greatest flaw\\, is not following it's source( The Force Awakens) and not setting up the future( The Rise of Skywalker). As a result\\, this movie in a bubble is excellent\\, but when it's shown to be the centre of a trilogy\\, it does a terrible job.","true":true}
