Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson crushed this out of the park.  He's the first director since Irvin Kershner to take Star Wars seriously\\, and try to take it somewhere new and relevant.  This movie has fantastic action setpieces (the final battle at the end\\, with the plumes of red soil and the white salt\\, is the most beautiful action sequence I've ever seen in Star Wars).\\n\\nThe movie doesn't go where you expect it to\\, and I love it for that.  It pays homage to the spirit of the original trilogy while refusing to cater to it.  \\n\\n*SPOILER WARNING BELOW*\\n\\n*SPOILER WARNING BELOW*\\n\\n*SPOILER WARNING BELOW*\\n\\nThere are a lot of people who feel disappointed there wasn't more fan service in the film\\, and I empathize.  I think they were expecting something a bit more predictable.  And the need for Luke Skywalker to do \\\"the force unleashed\\\" moment on the First Order - while I get the impulse\\, I really do - that's not who Luke is. That's not what the movie was about. The movie was about navigating the grey area between good and evil\\, and getting over one's preconceived (and perhaps idyllic) ideas of what it means to be a hero\\, or a legend. The movie - in Poe Dameron's arc - flat out says\\, \\\"Going in guns blazing is stupid and it gets people killed. It doesn't help.\\\"\\n\\nWhat I liked about TLJ is - maybe for the first time since ANH - it was a myth that attempted to speak to how we live\\, and how we see ourselves. That was Lucas's original intention with his focus on Joseph Campbell's work\\, and I think Rian Johnson did a masterful job of carrying on that idea into the 21st century.\\n\\nA myth shouldn't be about fan service. It should be about life.\\n\\nHUGE congratulations to the entire team\\, and to Rian Johnson for having the talent and the sheer gumption to helm a monster franchise like this and still do the unexpected.","true":true}
