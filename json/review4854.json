Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Confusing mess. No emotion. No joy whatsoever. Just endless political ideology. The other reviewers have covered things better than I can. Let me just add in the opening sequence they took what could have been a stirring battle and turned it into a prank call skit so dumb and hackneyed and out of place it could have singlehandedly ruined the movie\\, if not for the fact that the rest of the movie was even worse.","true":true}
