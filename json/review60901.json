We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"[SPOILER ALERT]\r\rHonestly having played the first last of us game\\, it was such a fun and enticing game\\, with an amazing storyline. It was both fun and harrowing experience playing.\r\rBut with this sequel\\, the only redeeming factor is the soundtrack and graphics. And that is all I can be amazed of\\, the gameplay hasn't changed much with a few tweaks and kinks being fixed from the first game\\, the characters aren't invested enough for me to be attached to and especially how the game just brush of the history of the first game for a cliche revenge story. Naughty dog definitely screwed up with this game\\, they could have delivered an amazing game even with just using Ellie as the only main character but no\\, they have to screw it up by bringing in a new character(Abby) which we the fans of the first game have no emotional value towards\\, so many flaws here and there\\, oh and I couldn't care less about using female characters\\, but at least make them likeable for us the players. The ending could also have been more impactful for us if it justified the death of Joel\\, it's hard seeing him die a dog's death with no reason.\r\rThis game took 7 years for them to make\\, it could have been better especially that storyline. Fans are already accustomed to the dark tone and are ready for anything Naughty dog could have given them\\, but this is just a complete mess\\, the amount of dark tone in this game isn't even justifiable. Seriously disappointed as a long time fan of both Naughty dog and the TLOU franchise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
