Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really wanted to like this movie.  However\\, this TLJ was the biggest let down in the history of the Star Wars franchise\\, and was a slap in the face to every fan.\\n\\nThe plot was incoherent and inconsistent\\, a complete cluster of nonsensical stupidity that completely deviated from everything good about the Star Wars universe.  Half of the (2 and a half hour long) movie was spent on a useless side-plot (Finn\/Rose in Canto Bight) that contributed nothing to the story.  The stupidity of Leia's Mary Poppins antics in the vacuum of space were downright mind boggling.  The lack of resolution of every question posed in The Force Awakens is a cop out and is downright abysmal.  Most disappointing of all\\, the destruction and complete misunderstanding of the Luke character was inexcusable.  The one true optimist through the original trilogy\\, who would go to the ends of the galaxy to save his father from the dark side\\, the 2nd most evil person in the universe\\, even if it cost him his own life\\, suddenly becomes a weak-minded fool who would kill his own nephew because he simply sensed the dark side in him?  This along with the plethora of other plot holes (don't even get me started on how illogical and ridiculous Luke's death was\\, or how killing off Snoke with no explanation behind his backstory\\, character\\, or motives left much to be desired) make TLJ quite possibly the WORST installment in Star Wars.  Yep\\, we're talking several rungs below even The Phantom Menace here.\\n\\nOf course it'd never happen\\, but it would be great if this movie was burned with fire\\, if they pretend it never happened\\, and if they re-released a second installment for the new trilogy in its place (one NOT directed by Rian Johnson).  Yes\\, it's that bad.","true":true}
