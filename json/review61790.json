The ending is terrible\\, there's no multiplayer like in the first game\\, and playing the game from start to finish feels like a chore. I had to intersperse my play through with intentionally killing the new ma'am at every opportunity just to get some satisfaction over this. Spare yourself the $60 and just watch spoilers online if you're really curious. But you're better off just enjoying the first game and pretending like this one doesn't exist.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
