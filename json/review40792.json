Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, although not perfect\\, has a great story\\, great characters and leaves us with a whole new set of questions. It has a little bit of dragging with the Finn and Rose arc\\, but I think it could be a set up for something really strong (the fact that there are other menacing things apart from the first order and that anyone can bring hope (refering to the final scene)). Aside from that and the phasma character\\, I think there are plenty of twists and surprises in this movie that do not feel forced.\\nPeople are saying it is a departure from the original saga and that is totally correct\\, and I value that as something good and brave because it is really difficult with a 40 year old franchise and they did greatly. Some (or many) may not agree with me (obviously) but I would say it is mainly because this movie is unexpected since for me the story and the direction of it makes total sense. And it is epic.","true":true}
