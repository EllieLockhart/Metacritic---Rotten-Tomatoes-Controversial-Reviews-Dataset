Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS*  This was not a great entry for the SW franchise. Structurally\\, it's a bit of a mess. They seemed to make a conscious effort to unceremoniously dump things set up in TFA\\, like Snoke's history\/identity and Rey's parentage. There are plot holes you could fly a Star Destroyer through. Sideways. Is it different than any other SW? Absolutely. But purely for the sake of being different. They didn't subvert audience expectations\\, they went so left-field that they left the ball park. No one predicted anything in this movie because they made it literally impossible to do so by being so ridiculous. Fathom this: the longest SW movie has no lightsaber fight. No\\, the Rey\/Kylo vs the Praetorian Guards does not count. It wasn't lightsaber vs lightsaber\\, Jedi vs Sith. And last\\, but possibly most significantly\\, Luke Skywalker's journey ends here\\, not with the all-powerful-Force-master bang we all wanted\\, but with a red herring whimper. Luke\\, and Mark Hamill\\, deserved much\\, much better. Don't believe the hype\\, folks.","true":true}
