Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Movie\\, not sure what all the bitching is about. Went with my daughters and when we walked out none of us could understand why anyone would not love it. Visually fantastc\\, great story progression\\, amazing action\\, wonderful twists. You can nit pick issues\\, just like any Star Wars movie\\, but I can't wait to watch it again.","true":true}
