Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a very hit and miss film\\, some parts of it are the best in the saga\\, and some of it only makes you scratch your head. The fact that Rian Johnson tried to expand the borders of star wars was a very nice idea\\, but it could've been done in a more elegant way.","true":true}
