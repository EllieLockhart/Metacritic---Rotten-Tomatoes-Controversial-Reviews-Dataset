Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's honestly a 3\/10 movie. It's a 0\/10 Star Wars movie. I don't mind the changes; I like change\\, I liked The Force Awakens\\, I like the new cast. I don't like the terrible writing\\, I don't like the various\\, unnecessary plot lines\\, I don't like the butchering of certain characters\\, I don't like Rian Johnson's incredibly questionable decision to turn it into a pseudo-comedy every 4 minutes. The film has absolutely no substance at all\\, and falls into tiny\\, undisgestible chunks upon any scrutiny whatsoever. Avoid this garbage fire like your life depends on it.","true":true}
