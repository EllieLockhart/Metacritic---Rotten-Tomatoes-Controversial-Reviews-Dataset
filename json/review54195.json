Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if there's every been a movie in RT history that got this much love\\, instead of taking the fact that FANS hated this movie\\, instead of honesty you see that they've reseat Audience score more than once now. this movie is god awful and its breaks so much of the star wars that we know and love. why this man was chosen and his decisions made it to the cutting room floor boggle my mind.","true":true}
