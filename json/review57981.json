Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When viewing this movie\\, I was yawning. I looked at the time and thought to myself\\, how is this not even half way through yet? At the end of the movie\\, I thought to myself\\, well that was a royal waste of time\\, I want my 2 and a half hour and money back! The plot was full of plot holes with so many conveniences that just blow my mind how stupid the writers think the audiences are. There are so many in-your-face political viewpoints: don't die a hero but follow orders without question\\, it is ok to protect your love one even at the cost of hundreds of others\\, capitalism drives the war (I was ok with this and thought it was a nice side of war we never thought about in star wars\\, but what is the point of introducing it? if it is so bad\\, can the characters do anything to stop capitalism? are they changing their focus on not space battle but political warfare now? if not then why even bother talking about it?)\\, slavery and animal abuse is both bad but let's just save the animals\\, and those kids? who cares if they are being forced into child labor and will probably have to clean up the mess we just made. There are good moments as well I'm sure\\, and the film has a lot of budget to spend on making it visually acceptable. However\\, the movie is just so overflown with plot holes\\, bad writing\\, bad characterization and out of place humor\\, that I cannot recall any of the good stuff. They tried so hard to make female lead a thing\\, but as a Vietnamese female\\, I never hated a female character in a movie more than Rose Tico. The actress did a great job\\, but too bad she had to play the most pointless character ever. The last scene with her and Finn\\, I cringed so hard I had to look away. Just\\, why? They met literally a few hours ago\\, she was doubtful of him most of the time\\, and now she loves him\\, and willing to sacrifice the last hope of the galaxy that her sister died trying to protect\\, for him. Wow\\, just wow.  Then I went to see Infinity Wars\\, not even once did I checked my watch\\, and the 2h40m went by like a flash. Like The Last Jedi\\, Infinity War was also tasked with bringing together the series' beloved characters and setting up the big bad villain for a grand finale\\, and it has done it without shitting on its characters\\, while respecting its fans and viewers. The Last Jedi should be ashamed of itself.","true":true}
