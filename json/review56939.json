Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The thing people don't get\\, and the way SW fans are being treated by criticizing this film because of it\\, is they think we are hating it because we're just fanboys who wanted to see the Legends stories used or we're just nitpicking. That is so far from the truth. Look\\, the movie\\, as a movie was great. Great acting\\, great cinematography\\, good humor. I love Kylo and Rey. But as a SW movie\\, it sucks. They are casually tossing out everything that came before it\\, in ways that are not cohesive to the established characters. They aren't even doing some new ones right\\, Finn has accomplished nothing with the screen time he has gotten\\, and in this movie his character arc REGRESSED instead of moving upwards. That's just horrible. I could say more but I won't be able to fit it all here.","true":true}
