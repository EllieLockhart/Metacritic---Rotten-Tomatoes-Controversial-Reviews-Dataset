Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gave me everything I wanted with Luke's story while introducing new mysteries in the force. Rian Johnson's vision is a game changer in the saga.I had a blast\\, don't expect all your questions to be answered in the second installment of the new trilogy relax!
