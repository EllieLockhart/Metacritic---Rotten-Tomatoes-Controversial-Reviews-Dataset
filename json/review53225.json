{"101487":110356,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold Again\\n\\nFinally\\, a worthy successor to Empire\\, far better than Jedi\\, the Prequels and the derivative Force Awakens. This one has the juice and bravery worth of young Lucas. Rian Johnson makes his own Star Wars and it is very good indeed. It is also flawed in certain ways - but let me give you the good news first.\\n\\nThe film is entertaining throughout\\, even in the slightly muddled middle\\, and is dramatically superior to any of the other Star Wars\\, even including Empire. It features genuine star performances from Hamill and Driver as Luke and Kylo Ren. It may be all over for Hamill\\, his great creation run its course. But not Driver\\, who will emerge a genuine star from this one. The action is strong\\, the FX are top notch and there are a few genuinely inspired plot and story surprises that come off brilliantly. \\n\\nThe story is about the tussle between the ying\/yang Kylo and Rey\\, and is full of ambiguity and genuine uncertainty. Ridley holds her own with Driver despite the incredibility of her character (which even Snoke comments upon). Given the dark nature of this chapter\\, it is plain who is going to get the upper hand\\, at least in the short term. Hamill is the monk(ey) in the middle and his Luke acts as the balance in the Force\\, figuratively and literally. \\n\\nNow for the bad stuff. The film is overlong\\, and it has some absurd complexity that makes it longer than it should be (the flabby middle is baffling but fun). The rampant feminism of Kennedy hurts the film. Not only Rey is incredible\\, but so is Leia (one gobsmacking Mary Sue moment). Carrie Fisher looks like they lifted her from the embalmer's table. Her performance is even worse than in the Force Awakens. Kennedy insists on having incredible female action heroes and generals throughout the film. In the entire history of the world\\, women have never been men's equals in war -but not in the feminist re-write of human nature seen here. It is a minor\\, unnecessary distraction in an otherwise thrilling romp. But it does not auger well for the future.\\n\\nThere are other decent performances - Boyega\\, Isaac and Tran are all good\\, and BB-8 is lots of fun. There is a decent sense of humour too. The Porgs are ridiculous\\, Chewy is superfluous\\, and there is a stunning CGI chase that lifts the sagging middle. Andy Serkis - the CGI Snoke - is great but should have been real not CGI.\\n\\nI am not a nerd and I'm not going to let my reservations hold me back - this is the best Star Wars since Empire. It lacks the simplicity and story arc of Empire\\, but makes up for it with an emotionally charged\\, character driven SF spectacular the likes of which we've never seen. Nearly great. Maybe next time\\, if Rian\\, not JJ writes Episode 9.","true":true}
