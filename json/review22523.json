Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's cut to the chase here; I loathed the Last Jedi.\\nI expected a downer movie\\, like Empire strikes back.  I didn't expect a bloated  2 hr 20 min of cheap emotional manipulation that was beyond depressing.\\nThe pacing was horrible and the plot weaker than weak - what WAS the point of the movie?  Besides battering the audience and providing the opportunity for lots of flashy CGI and cool special effects?  Please.\\nDon't waste your money!  Oh\\, and I will NEVER see a film involving JJ Abrams again.  Never.  Star Trek was pretty much destroyed by Rick Berman but he drove the last nails into the coffin\\, and now he's finished what Lucas started with the weak prequel trilogy.","true":true}
