Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined star wars for me.  I have never been so upset with a film. Lacks story entirely - breaks star wars with hyperspace ram (let's go back and hyperspace shoot things at the death star?)\\, spends half the film writing in 2 irrelevant side characters who turn out to be useless for the film story\\, Luke - the hero who never gives up and always sees the good in people has a complete personality swap to bitter old man who considers  killing his family?\\, Rey blinks and becomes more power than Yoda\\, not one of the baddies is believeable as an actual leader of an order\\, and really one of your dozen space ships can't Lightspeed around and catch the rebel ship? Really? Or hell one of the rebels can't turn one of the less important ships around to blast that at them? Instead they just allow all the ships to die...I just...who thought this made sense...who?","true":true}
