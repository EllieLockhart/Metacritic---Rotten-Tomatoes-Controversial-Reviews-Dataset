Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie I have ever seen in my life!!! It's upsetting. I was angry after watching this. Rian Johnson\\, the director\\, literally spit on all our faces making this movie. It's filled with awful surprises that make no sense whatsoever. Worst movie ever. I would give it -5 stars if allowed.","true":true}
