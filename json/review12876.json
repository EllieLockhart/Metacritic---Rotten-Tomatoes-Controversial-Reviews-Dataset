Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didnt' like the fact that the questions raised in the Force Awakens were ignored.  This presented a lot of issues going into the next film.  I really didn't like how the character of Luke Skywalker was portrayed in this movie\\, it just didn't fit.  Would have also liked to see more interaction between the trio of Finn\\, Rey\\, and Poe\\, or at least Finn and Poe as their relationship was very interesting in the previous film\\, but almost non-existent in this one.","true":true}
