Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, Galore.\\nVeRy little respect paid to the original Trilogy characters. The movie tries too hard to make you foRget about all the Star Wars Movies and characters that came before it.\\n\\nHorrible Casino scene mid way through\\, that feels like it should be in a different movie series. \\n\\nThis is not up to the level of Force Awakens. Too many plot points from Force awakens\\, are completely ignored. Some entertaining battle scenes make it barely worth watching.","true":true}
