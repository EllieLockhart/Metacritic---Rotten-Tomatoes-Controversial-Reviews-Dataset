Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent cinematography. Kylo Ren is an interesting and fleshed out character and...That's pretty much all. \\nThis movie is all about inclusiveness. Yet\\, at the same time\\, it tries to cast away the old fans by spitting on the myth and the universe.  \\n\\nA few points: although\\, as a woman\\, I am more than welcoming the new female characters\\, would it be too much to ask for better fleshed out women? Being a woman does not make one a flawless\\, invincible \\\"badass\\\". Women are as diverse as men and deserve to be treated as such. The old EU and the current cannon provide multiple examples of compelling\\, \\\"strong\\\" women\\, yet flawed and\\, consequently\\, interesting (Ahsoka\\, Kreia\\, Barriss\\, Ventress...)\\n\\nWhere the hell is Anakin Skywalker? How do you explain that the main character of the 6 previous movies do not even make an appearance? Where is his force ghost? Why using other characters whose story is entirely closed and not Anakin who still has strong ties with the current characters? \\n\\nLuke. Luke's descent into abyss is poorly written and badly explained. Consequently\\, it simply destroys one of the most iconic character ever created. Episode IX would have to do something to TRULY redeem Luke. \\n\\nThe humour. The humour is really bad in this movie and contrasts with the clever\\, more \\\"British\\\" humour of the two previous trilogies (nothing as witty\\, fun and meme worthy as \\\"hello there\\\"\\, \\\"so uncivilized\\\" or \\\"aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\\\" \\n\\nAfter TFA\\, who was flawed yet really intriguing\\, I was expecting much better from TLJ and have been seriously disappointed. I hope episode 9 will be able to salvage the saga while there is still time.","true":true}
