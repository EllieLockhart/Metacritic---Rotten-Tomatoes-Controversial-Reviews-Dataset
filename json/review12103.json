Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a 30-year fan who went in without expectations. This movie blew me away. It takes risks\\, but they are great choices. The movie shakes up the mythology and rights some of the more repetitive plot points of its predecessor. It keeps you on your feet and kills a lot of the over used tropes of the franchise. That may be why some dislike it\\, however\\, it really is not worth the hate. It's a stellar movie with amazing performances all around. A brilliant addition to the saga. Well done\\, Rian Johnson!","true":true}
