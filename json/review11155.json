Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy Crap. Star Wars The Last Jedi was an awesome experience. Has some of my favorite Star Wars experiences in the saga. However\\, I will need time to understand all the little details. One of my favorite movies of the year and if you don't see it this weekend you're a fool. My main problems with the last jedi is that in key moments it shifts tone and takes me out of the story - not the movie because you are entranced in the Star Wars world that has been set by the first moments of the film. Mark Hamill has an outstanding performance. Every moment Kylo Ren is on screen the movie is perfect. Certain characters do not get a proper story making them not have a full impact.  Overall the the moments that are great in this movie far out weigh the negatives.  If you cannot except the way the movie starts then when it get going it may be hard to except the way it counties to grow.","true":true}
