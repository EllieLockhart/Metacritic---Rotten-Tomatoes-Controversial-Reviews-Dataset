Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining and fun. I laughed out loud a few times. I get that some die-hard fans have some negative things to say\\, but you are never going to get them to like anything!! There is no Jar-Jar to hate\\, a few times there were something reflective of the good'ole series... but overall\\, it was 2 1\/2 hours of a sci-fi adventure that made you believe in the good of people and the unbelievable magic that is Star Wars.","true":true}
