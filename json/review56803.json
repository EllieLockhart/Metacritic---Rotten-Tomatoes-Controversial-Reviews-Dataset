Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was\\, certainly\\, surprising but was still a very enjoyable watch! I'd like to keep this spoiler free so I'll say that 'The Last Jedi' was a stick of dynamite in its' divisive choices and its' release of the old storyline and characters. It seems like a movie for\\, relatively\\, newer fans vs older ones in that I would imagine that many fans that have any major attachment to the original characters might take some issue with some of the plot twists. If you find that you can walk into the theatre with a willingness to release the old and embrace the new\\, I think this movie could surprise you in the best way. If not\\, re-runs of the original trilogy might you prefer.","true":true}
