Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rather than re-iterate the astute observations of those of us who disliked\/hated this poor excuse of a movie. It should be pointed out that The Last Jedi seemed like a bloated\\, fragmented assortment of poorly connected scenes and little else. Furthermore\\, the ham-handed? attempt at diversity and inclusion was so poorly executed and serves only to saddle TLJ as a movie that wanted to make a statement about social justice and not tell a good story. If Johnson's vision was to kill the past then he has indeed succeeded. The deconstructed script effectively cut any ties to the episodes that came before and it was helped along by Disney's filmmaking by committee\\, which appeared more interested in marketability and not in character and story development. If this were a relay race then Kathleen Kennedy\\, J. J. Abrams\\, Rian Johnson et. al. have dropped the baton.","true":true}
