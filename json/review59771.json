Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a joke. There literally is no meaning to the story. It's all about REVENGE and pointless violence. A lot of characters get killed off\\, just like that. Completely randomly by some random passerby. No real mourning or buld up. The characters get killed so much\\, that there are hardly any characters to even like left\\, although there isn't that much to like from the very beginning.This game is a joke.

Also what's really upsetting and makes no sense is\\, that no matter where you go\\, you get attacked by a horde of humans\\, that you mow down like some trashmobs. What's even the reason for most humans to directly murder each other?! There is no reason\\, but it's more a war between humans\\, than it is vs infected abominations. Also what about the immunity?! Nothing at all. This game didn't include any plot or quality\\, it merely tried to abuse exploitation methods like horror and violence. 7 years for something like that. It also really seems like a lot of the positive reviews were fake or paid off. In all twitch chats I have seen so far\\, there was COMPLETE consensus that people didn't like the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
