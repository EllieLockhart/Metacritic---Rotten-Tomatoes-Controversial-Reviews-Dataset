Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was the best star wars movie in my opinion. Everyone who complains about rule breaking or bad character decisions is missing the point. All of the scenes with the force are meant to expand the force\\, none of them are unbelievable\\, and they are meant to show you that the force is \\\"more than just lifting rocks\\\". The Leia scene is not that bad\\, she is near death\\, of course the force is going to become strong for her\\, the force is plot armour in a sense and it always has been. The visuals were amazing\\, just incredible. The milk scene...whats wrong with people\\, they are showing Luke's routine on the island\\, its just milk\\, also if anything people should look at it as an homage to Blue milk. There was a plot\\, it was to save the resistance....thats been the plot in both new movies and the OT\\, its all about saving the galaxy.\\n\\nPeople are complaining about insignificant things\\, IMO its from not understanding certain things.","true":true}
