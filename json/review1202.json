Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pleasant surprise from beginning to end and the best film of the franchise since the first one. The visuals\\, sound and effects were all amazing but what made this stand out was how quickly those 150 minutes flew: it's packed with both action and character insight\/ growth and rarely puts a foot wrong. Nothing's black-and-white\\, the motives of everyone are thought-out\\, all action scenes range from great to fucking amazing and although there's so much going on it never feels rushed or overloaded.","true":true}
