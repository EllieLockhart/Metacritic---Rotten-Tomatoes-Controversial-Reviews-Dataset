Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a pretty big star wars fan\\, have been for a long time. I did not like this movie though. For the same reasons other have mentioned. I expected greater plot depth and character development\\, Luke to do more with a light saber\\, and no people flying in space without spaceships. For a Star Wars fan\\, this is like your favorite sports team having a bad season. I hope the next one is better.","true":true}
