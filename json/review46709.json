Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We all understand what he was trying to do with this film.I get it. I love beautiful artistic films\\, and I really think that this one wasn't thought through. In the process of trying to create something different\\, they destroyed Luke Skywalker\\, and insulted all the fans of Luke in the process. Yoda was a fake version of himself\\, insulting people who actually read. I understand why some people think it is great\\, just because it subverts your expectations\\, but it tries to hard\\, and as a result\\, none of the characters deserve our sympathy\\, or empathy. They don't deserve anything\\, because none of them are likable.","true":true}
