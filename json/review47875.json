Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While a few things in the movie did throw me off (le\u00eda flying)\\, it still had many great moments in it. It's hard to see the changing of the guard in Star Wars\\, but it is something that has to happen to keep the series moving forward and fresh\\, and bring in new and younger fans. In the end I really enjoyed it\\, Luke went out like a champ!!!","true":true}
