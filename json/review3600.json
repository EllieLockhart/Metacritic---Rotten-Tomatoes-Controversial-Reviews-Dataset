Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy. I laughed\\, I cried. I laughed some more\\, then I cried some more. Excellence in all technical aspects from sfx to sound to acting and directing. Truly outstanding. Those giving it bad ratings apparently didn\u2019t see the same movie as I did!!! ","true":true}
