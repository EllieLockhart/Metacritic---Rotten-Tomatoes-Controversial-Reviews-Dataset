Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens ended with Luke Skywalker meditating while lifting huge boulders above the cliffs of Achoo-Gesundheit.\\n\\nThen Rian Johnson happened. \\n\\nHe loved the idea of Luke throwing away the lightsaber so much he set his film immediately after the remake of A New Hope. That's the only reason. A sight gag.\\n\\nThat decision left no room for character development between movies. \\n\\nAnd left nothing for them to do in this one.\\n\\nThe ending of The Farce Awakens had to be changed from an epic reveal to Luke using the infamous Joey Tribbiani 'Smell the Fart' acting technique. \\n\\nIn short\\, the people making these movies are a bunch of numpties.","true":true}
