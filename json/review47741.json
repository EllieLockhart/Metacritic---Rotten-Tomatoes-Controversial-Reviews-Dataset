Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When you read the expanded universe books and saw the way the Luke character was treated and then see him reduced to this you just feel your dreams being mocked\\, I am happy if people can find happiness with this movie and i don't intend to try and believe me not liking it means I should protest for it to be changed but I cannot enjoy it as much as I tried.","true":true}
