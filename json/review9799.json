Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gravity in space\\, no shields on dreadnoughts\\, dumb enemies\\, a new Jarjar in the Rose character\\, Luke is wasted\\, floating Lea\\, nonsensical motivations and the worst admiral in Star Wars history. .......and mush more. Luke said it in episode IV \\\"What a piece of junk\\\".","true":true}
