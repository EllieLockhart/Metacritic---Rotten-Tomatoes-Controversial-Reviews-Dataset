Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Changing the writer made it inconsistent\\, messy\\, and feel very contrived. The jokes were completely the wrong tone for Star Wars\\, definitely giving in to the trend of self-referential humor\\, instead of something more in line with\\, well\\, essentially a story about war. It seems such a waste not to use all of the material from the novels instead! Still not as bad as the prequels\\, but does that really need to be the bar we lower it to? Can we at least scrap this and start over from where Force Awakens left off? Help us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope! Or Zahn... I don't care\\, just someone\\, anyone help fix it!","true":true}
