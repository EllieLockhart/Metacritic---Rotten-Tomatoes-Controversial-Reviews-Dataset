Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disaster of a movie. They completely ignored not only the character development from the original Star Wars films cut also the continuity from the force awakens. They ruined there characters and Luke Skywalker. I don't know what kind of an idiot you have to be to fail this bad at making a film from a series this popular\\, not even the prequels are bad. If you like star wars of are incapable of \\\"just shutting your brain off\\\" then don't watch this terrible movie.","true":true}
