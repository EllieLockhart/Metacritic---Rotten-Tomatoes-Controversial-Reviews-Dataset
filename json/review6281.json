Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is trying to use friendly media outlets to claim there's an online conspiracy to reduce the film's score on Rotten Tomatoes - no\\, sorry\\, there are really good reasons to have been underwhelmed by this not-awful but not-great film. Unnecessarily long given sub-plots that go nowhere at all; utterly unfocused; so little time with any character that it's near impossible to feel anything for any of what occurs; cutesy CGI animals sprayed over the top; nudge-nudge-wink-to-camera lines and moments breaking the mood... This film needed a lot of flab trimming. Still\\, it was diverting\\, fun\\, had the core of something good in the middle of it.","true":true}
