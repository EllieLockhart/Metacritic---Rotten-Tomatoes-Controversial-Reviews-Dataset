Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not a Star Wars movie. Rian went out of his way to disrespect fans with this film\\, and then coupled that with a PR campaign to bully fans who did not enjoy his take. Huge miss for Disney and Lucasfilm.","true":true}
