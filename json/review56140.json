Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler Free Review!)\\nAs a long time Star Wars fan\\, I just absolutely loved this movie.  I haven't been that taken up with the excitement of action scenes\\, haven't laughed that hard\\, and overall haven't enjoyed myself that much in many years at the theater.  The last movie I saw that I enjoyed this much was probably Return of the King (Lord of the Rings).\\n\\nThe performances are all stellar\\, particularly from John Boyega\\, Hamill\\, and Fisher.  The writing was both interesting\\, thoughtful\\, intricately winding\\, and at times very light.  But we're not talking Jar Jar light\\, I mean actually funny (not for 4 year olds only) light.  I can't wait to see it again\\, and I absolutely loved it.\\n\\nOn a related note\\, I'm very confused about the \\\"negative reviews\\\".  It seems like RT is having an issue reporting correctly on this for Audience Score\\, as there are thousands of reviews from users whose profile pages no longer exist.  Rumor online is that there's a push from some groups to purposely drive down the rating of this movie with spam reviews (not sure the cause\\, Disney's political moves can certainly be questioned).  And while I do get some of the motivation\\, I'm hoping RT cleans this up so we can get a genuine Audience Score.  Everyone in the theater I saw it with was overjoyed\\, all of my friends (some of whom are very discerning as I feel like I tend to be) enjoyed it thoroughly also.","true":true}
