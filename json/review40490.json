Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most fun I've had watching a Star Wars film since 1983. I love being surprised at the movies and I got exactly that. I was not prepared for what I saw at all and I think that is why I enjoyed it so much. Saw it 3 nights running and can't wait to see it again. Rian Johnson has blown a breathe of fresh air into the franchise. Hamills performance of a broken man was nothing short of amazing. Absolutely loved the humour too. Bravo.","true":true}
