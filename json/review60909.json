You then are FORCED to play as Abby for TEN HOURS and you have to FIGHT ELLIE. Later on as Ellie you have a farm with Dina and you have Jessie\u2019s baby. Tommy shows up and shows Ellie where Abby is. She travels all the way from Wyoming to Southern California just to beat the **** out of Abby but let her live because apparently killing the person who beat Joel to death with a golf club in front of you is wrong (the game tries to justify Abby\u2019s actions by making the doctor you killed as Joel at the end of the first game her father but that\u2019s just lazy writing). Ellie then goes back home to find that Dina and the baby are gone and then the game just ends. You really couldn\u2019t have tried harder to ruin a great game franchise Neil. Have you not learned that inserting politics and forced inclusion into your game damns it? You deserve to be fired for your idiocy and never show your face in the gaming world again. In the end I\u2019m both upset and angry about the amount of time we waited for this game but just to receive a terrible story full of forced inclusion and identity politics. If you haven\u2019t yet I strongly recommend DO NOT buy this game and DO NOT give Naughty Dog and more money to make anymore trash like this. Great gameplay terrible story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
