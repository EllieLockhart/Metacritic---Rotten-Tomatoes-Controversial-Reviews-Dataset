Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An uneven mess of a movie.  There is so much ridiculous stuff in this movie that it really cancels out the great things that it gets right.  The Leia scene is the dumbest thing that's ever happened in all of Star Wars.  \\n\\nThis was  a great movie if you focus on only Rey\/Ren\/Luke.  Unfortunately\\, that would have resulted in a 45 minute movie.  The whole Finn\/Rose storyline is rushed and pointless.  The whole Poe Dameron storyline is contrived and boring.  The movie outside of the Jedi\/Sith dynamics is a very straight forward and paper thin plot.  \\n\\nSnoke is completely wasted.  He only gets one real scene in the movie and then he is out of the series.  \\n\\nThey wasted Captain Phasma for the second consecutive movie.  That character is beyond meaningless in the scope of the franchise.  She's literally less important than Nute Gunray\\, which is a tragedy. \\n\\nThe pacing is terrible.  The jokes are largely unfunny.  The plot ping pongs back and forth between different characters so much that it never gains momentum.\\n\\nJust an uneven mess.","true":true}
