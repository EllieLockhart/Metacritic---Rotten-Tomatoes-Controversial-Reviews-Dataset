{"101487":169998,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: Last Jedi\\n\\n\\\"Move over Episode I\\,II\\, you sadly have unexpected company\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\nMaking a Star Wars movie is no easy task\\, J.J. Abrams agonized over his decision to say yes to Episode VII\\, no to Episode VIII\\, and yes again for the next installment.  Right now \\\"The Last Jedi is making hundreds of millions at the box office and I'm sure Disney executives are patting themselves on the back\\, job well done.  The critics amazingly and curiously seem to love it\\, though with those same hundreds of millions at stake\\, who knows\\, modern day payola? The loss of net neutrality? Its hard to say\\, but the fans have started to congeal and their opinion\\, which I'm hoping is based on what they saw in the context of what has come before it is starting to mount and it is not good.  This movie will fall in the bottom pantheon of Star Wars efforts\\, as time goes on it will not age well and I can envision the boxed sets that hopefully see a solid ninth installment allowing fans to skip The Last Jedi.\\n\\nWhen you are making a Space Odyssey on this scale the creation of tension\\, suspension of disbelief\\, are hard things to over come.  But the fans have already bought in to this fable; all you need to do is come up with a story that is plausible in a world where the amazing is possible.  The creation of this tension is what seems to separate the Episode III\\, IV\\, V\\, VI and VII (a good run there) from the rest.  The main problem with The Last Jedi is that it seems to intertwine awkward nods to the franchise with widely inconsistent plot tangents.  If you can't achieve tension in your story ideas\\, how about striving for a little consistency?  \\n\\nSPOLIERS (duh).  Luke as the reluctant hero?  Ok it's a premise\\, but from the first scene\\, I'm sure to be the much panned\\, slap stick chucking of the light saber over his back after Rey hands it to him\\, Rian Johnson is seemingly staking his territory by peeing on Star Wars artifacts along the way.  How about Princess Leah?  Well there is some nice tension as Kylo Ren attacks her Star Cruiser but fails to deliver the final blow; she gets blown into space anyway (taking Admiral Ackbar with her)\\, but she doesn't die.  Instead Leah uses the force in a way she never even hinted at before\\, gaining consciousness in space and using the force to propel to safety without a space suit? I'm all for new = Cool\\, but this is \\\"insert eye roll emoji\\\" all the way.\\n\\nHow about the much anticipated and hyped\\, Rey = student\\, Luke=Master portion of the movie? Well he never actually teaches her anything! The movie trailers of her lifting pebbles and him saying \\\"breath\\\" are about it.  Rey hops around the island trying to convince Luke to help\\, and even after the one scene he has with R2 D2 (nice nod to Episode IV) leading to his willingness to train her\\, he never actually does\\, they fight\\, she wins and then leaves to confront Snoke and turn Kylo Ren? For someone who never really receives any Jedi training\\, Rey becomes this great Jedi with all these skills?  Even when they set up her ability to have a realistic progression to a Jedi it gets botched.  How about her scene in the Dark Side of the Force Cave? (an obvious nod to Luke in the Cave on Yoda's planet in Episode V) Nothing really happens in the cave\\, well she established this pseudo link to Kylo Ren (who is really Snoke manipulating them both?)\\n\\nHow about Finn? It seems as if Rian Johnson really had no plan for Finn.  He goes on some quest to find a code breaker that really is a waste of 45 mins of screen time\\, really doesn't accomplish anything and despite a lot of action and introducing Benecio Del Toro (I always knew a movie was a clunker when a great actor seems ordinary or out of place in a movie because their star power easily overwhelms the script; In Last Jedi that feat is accomplished not once\\, BUT TWICE with Del Toro and Laura Dern) as a anti-hero who later betrays him does little for Finn's character development.  I'm not even going to deal with Rose (Finn's new companion) she's fine as a character\\, but is not memorable\\, that said at least there's an attempt at character development.  \\n\\nAnd then there are the cameos.  I understand Johnson inherited a lot of plot items from Abrams\\, however his solutions fall into three categories\\, dismiss them (the Skywalker lightsaber; make then frustratingly awkward (Luke and Rey\\, Finn and everyone); or resolves them in 1-2 minutes of screen time in cameos (Maz Kanata\\, Phasma\\, or Leah in what is essentially an extended cameo).  Even minor items that must have taken Abrams hours of planning and decisions to subtlety integrate as creative decisions are awkwardly discarded.  Take Kylo Ren's mask\\, an obvious homage to Darth Vader.  The design the usage\\, his voice inside all subtle victories for Episode VII\\, quickly and awkwardly discarded early in the movie as Kylo is belittled by Snoke and destroys it in a tantrum.  I suppose you could argue that once the mask was off at the end of the previous installment it had completed its usefulness\\, but it usage here seems so trivial.  I will save you from the Maz Kanata and Yoda cameos which are clunky\\, again awkward and do little to serve the story\\, it would have been well and good to just leave well enough alone.\\n\\nAnd the ending ..... I'm sure the cat is out of the bag\\, Luke dies.  Yep\\, he follows his friend Han Solo into the realm of casualties\\, but while the shock value and tension of Han's demise made for this memorable scene and the build up to it made sense.  Sure we were upset\\, its Han Solo for $($(% sake\\, but his death launched so much emotion.  Here Luke goes out with a whimper\\, Johnson's huge plot twist\\, that he was a projection and not really there to face off against Kylo Ren is\\, in of itself all you need to know\\, HE WASN'T ACTUALLY EVEN THERE.  I'm sure the Episode VII team is all smile with all the Easter Eggs (his light saber never touched the salt ground\\, he slid rather that blocked Kylo Ren's Saber et.) but their internal triumph is also boils down to an inside joke that is revealed to no one laughing.  The point being\\, HE WASN'T ACTUALLY EVEN THERE FOR his big Death scene!!!! Nope he dies alone\\, on an island\\, without training Rey\\, without reveling much\\, having an awkward scene with Yoda\\, poof the end (though there is a nice nod to his epic scene looking out towards the setting of two suns) but those little elements are glossed over as trite and too few.\\n\\nIn the end The Last Jedi will make hundreds of millions\\, people will see it just to see it.  For the spectacle\\, the nostalgia and all those things that make Star Wars part of the pop culture fabric.  But it's a middling effort\\, at best a tad better than Episode I and II (and I'm tempted to go back and watch those just to make sure).  And that's the real point\\, the real test is will fans watch it over and over again?  The tide of NO is already mounting.  The post theater release sales\\, I'm pretty sure they will be in decline from Force Awakens.  It takes a real deft hand to venture into this water as I said\\, Johnson I'm told moved to San Francisco and had regular meetings with the Star Wars brass so maybe this doesn't all fall to him\\, but the first closing credit is\\, \\\"written and directed by Rian Johnson\\\" so most of the buck stops there.  I really wanted to like this movie\\, but it inserts flash for story substances\\, is awkward and delivers too many unbelievable plot twists in the ultimate unbelievable world\\, not an easy feat.  I guess the streak had to stop sometime.  So for those keeping score at home\\, Episode III through VII\\, have the fast forward button ready through Last Jedi and hold out hope JJ Abrams can redeem this trilogy arc in Episode IX.  May the force be with him\\, he has a lot of cleaning up to do.","true":true}
