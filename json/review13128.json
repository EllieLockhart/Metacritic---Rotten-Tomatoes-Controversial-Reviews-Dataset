Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know whether to cry or scream in anger over how much I hated this movie. Star Wars has been officially ruined. Characters were killed off ridiculously while others lived that should have died. The force apparently has new rules. Screen time was hogged by characters no one gives a shit about. I won't be wasting money seeing the third installment. I'd rather pretend Star Wars ended with George Lucas. The only exception of this would be Rogue One because it felt like an actual Star Wars movie. Too bad there aren't more installments of that story line.","true":true}
