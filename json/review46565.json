Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching this movie for the first time\\, I left the theater like I had just witnessed a 42 car wreck\\, something so horrible and painful to watch yet your eyes keep your gaze transfixed on it. \\n\\nThis movie was awful. Absolutely and simply awful. Do not trust the critics who are foaming at the mouth for this movie and shouting \\\"Yippee! Rian Johnson made Star Wars progressive!\\\" Rian Johnson has essentially turned a beloved series of films into a shell of the original films\\, the only things left to let the audience know that this is a Star Wars film is the title\\, Mark Hamill\\, and lightsabers\\, because the rest of Star Wars has been pushed aside in order to cram the most corny and contrived political messages about love down our poor throats.\\n\\nAnd this is besides the fact that not a single damn thing makes any sense! I'll go over the word limit telling you everything that makes no sense\\, like:\\nWhy all the sudden do the AT-ATs look like silverback gorillas?!\\nWhy in the hell can Princess Leia magically gain the powers of the force after she has been suffocating in space for ten minutes just to superman fly back onto her ship which is being attacked\\, only to go into a coma despite 45th century medical technology failing to bring her out of it?\\nWhy does Kyle Ren go from bad\\, to good\\, to bad?\\nWho is Snoke\\, why is he dressed up like Goldmember from Austin powers\\, and how does he get iced by Kyle if he is able to manipulate him so easily and see everything he thinks? \\nWhat happened to the original storm trooper designs and why do they all look like Japanese samurai now?\\nWhat was with the Dark Force cavern in the island and what in the hell kind of purpose did it serve other than to slow the pace of the story down and solve nothing\\, or any questions that we had about Rey's path or destiny or past\\, just to give us more questions?\\nWhy does Mark Hamill have to moan the entire movie. \\\"Oh\\, woe is me! Woe is me! I can't do anything right and I'm a failure!\\\" Even Yoda comes in half way through to tell him to cut that crap out!\\nWhy do we have to be bombarded with half-assed attempts at humor and political messages about evil rich people and animal rights and love? It's a freaking Star Wars movie! Talk about the balance between good and evil\\, what sacrifices it takes to be a rebel\\, or something? Please?\\nWhy does Admiral Holdo look like a chronic smoker wearing grey curtain drapes and purple hair? Seriously? God forbid the admiral of a rebel space fleet wear military attire!\\n\\nThe only real redeeming qualities of the movie are the performances by Rey\\, Poe\\, and Hux\\, and the light saber battles. Extremely disappointed\\, don't listen to the critics and DO NOT see this movie!","true":true}
