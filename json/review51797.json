Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adventure\\, Excitement\\, plenty of both! Defiantly a visual epic worth seeing\\, its drawback was a convoluted number of storylines and some ham and cheese. Other than that the suspense was hair raising\\, the stakes seemed real and the laughs were out loud. Both Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher had memorable performances. Critics love it\\, Audiences have had a much more lukewarm response\\, I side more with the critics on this one. Hard to say more without spoilers. See it on the biggest screen you can.","true":true}
