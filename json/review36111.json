Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a great script kept me off guard  the entire film. The action sequences were any fanboys dream. It really leaves a lot to look forward to in future films. So if you searching for an epic battle In space sprinkled with a little Force action in between this is the one!","true":true}
