Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie needs to be digested first before being rated in my honest opinion. When first finishing this movie I did not feel the childhood glee that the Force Awakens left me with nor the incredible hype it did. Rather\\, this movie left me solemn and morose. It was not until I slept and really thought about the movie that my perception changed and I actually really enjoyed this film. I completely understand the negative perception of this film and why people did not like it (however\\, the ratings are almost putting this in Attack of the Clones bad which is untrue - rewatch that movie if you disagree). However\\, this film was very enjoyable and much like the story of this film\\, it is far from perfect. Yes\\, this film suffers from some slugged pacing\\, some of the characters did not live up to fan's expectation\\, Leia's infamous scene felt strange\\, and this film took some radical turns for a sequel to a trilogy. \\n\\nHowever\\, the things this film does right it hits right. The performances from all the cast are great (the performances\\, not their arcs)\\, the expansion of the lore\\, and the way in which Johnson took our expectations and flipped them. The thing that really moved this movie from a \\\"meh\\\" to a \\\"great\\\" for me is the fact that this film took risks and removed us from the trodden path that J.J. was more than happy to take us down. This film threw away the ideas of black & white in the world\\, showed us that heroes fail\\, and that the galactic conflict between the now First Order and Resistance is not on a moral high ground - parties prosper from conflict. If you wanted another comfortable Star Wars movie this film will disappoint you. You may find during your second viewing that the things you did not like during the first viewing become less egregious. May the force be with you all.","true":true}
