Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who\u2019s idea was it to turn Luke into a whining child who picks up his toys and goes home? This just isn\u2019t a plot twist that makes any sense at all!","true":true}
