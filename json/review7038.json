Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easy to hate for those that dislike straying away from the norm\\, but for someone who simply enjoys these movies (but hated the prequals) it was a much needed breath of fresh air for a franchise that\\, untill now\\, I've never been very interested in. I loved it.","true":true}
