Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rating: 35\/100\\, 35% Grade: F Let me start by saying I\u2019ve been a huge Star Wars fan since childhood. \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d does not get bad ratings due to sour grape fans or any type of outrage. Simply put\\, it is a bad Star Wars movie. Which means\\, it\u2019s a very bad movie overall. The film is unrecognizable compared to any other Star Wars film\\, the dialogue is beyond cheesy and you will wonder if actors are reading from cue cards during filming. Rian Johnson singlehandedly did his best to ruin Luke Skywalker\u2019s legacy\\, made a complete joke of The Force\\, and destroyed every set up JJ Abraham\u2019s stacked up for him. The Last Jedi is one of the worst films of the 2010s\\, and if you haven\u2019t seen it yet\\, I am envious. ","true":true}
