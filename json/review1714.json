Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a relatively new Star Wars fan I went into this movie with pretty much no expectations. Yes\\, there was excitement but after the Force Awakens I pretty much put this franchise on the backburner. However\\, I loved the movie\\, so much so that I went to see it two days in a row. The plot had some issues with pacing\\, but the movie was interesting and fresh and definitely made me crave more. Since I've seen the movie there hasn't been a day that I haven't watched at least one video related to Star Wars and because of that\\, I would like to thank Rian Johnson for giving me that crazy rush and a borderline obsession with the new franchise.","true":true}
