Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an incoherent\\, inconsistent\\, stupid movie. I really don't understand what Rian Johnson is trying to do : destroying all coherence with the 8 previous movies (including Rogue one) ? Leia flying\\, Rey and Ben jedi skyping\\, Luke not even fighting... In addition to this massacre\\, the jokes are mocking the design of the space ships (like the flatiron one\\, come on)... A scenario that leads to no real evolution\\, no charisma from any character. Very disappointing.","true":true}
