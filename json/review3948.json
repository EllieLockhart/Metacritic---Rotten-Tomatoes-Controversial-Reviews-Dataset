Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring characters which are played by boring perfect looking actors. It has not got any deeper meaning and it does not send any deeper message to audience. It shows a big disrespect to previous movies and it does not take us anywhere. It shows us some big contradictions and its colored by SJW politics. Honestly\\, just a movie for 12 years old kids.","true":true}
