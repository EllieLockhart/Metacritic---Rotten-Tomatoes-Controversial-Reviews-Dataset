Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the force awakens had opened 2 years ago I was super excited and had a lot of anticipation for episode 8. I left the theatre after watching episode 8 very torn. This was not the movie I had been waiting for for 2 years. There were so many things that were rushed and they spent too much time trying to develop a couple new characters. This movie does not even seem like it is supposed to follow episode 7. If you watch these back to back they will feel like exact opposites. This movie does not feel like a Star Wars movie\\, that allure is not there. It is a good movie\\, sure\\, but a disappointment would be an understatement.","true":true}
