Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was a good movie. mix of funny and action. there was good CGI and a lot of shockers. the movie as a lot of sadness but is worth it. Luke dieing was sad and shocker.","true":true}
