Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How anyone let this film to be made should be fired and should never be allowed to come anywhere near another movie being made. We all should demand that ever copy is removed from theaters and burned rid us all from the pain torment and agony this film has caused.","true":true}
