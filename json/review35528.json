{"101487":175092,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has some really fantastic moments\\, but fails in its entirety to be a solid Star Wars film. While the acting from all the main characters is excellent\\, including a painful and poignant scene between Luke and Leia\\, some of the directions the characters took were confusing and some characters were just plain useless. The return of Yoda was perhaps my favorite part along with any scene that contained Rey. Again\\, this is an enjoyable movie but it has many problems in the context of Star Wars.\\nProblem 1: The movie has no context. Moviegoers were ushered into the world of The Force Awakens with excitement and left with numerous questions about how all of this world fit together and what did the force have in mind as a destiny for our heroes. In this movie\\, all those questions were swept off the table because either they didn't matter or the answers were unsatisfying. I find the revelation that Rey's parents were nobody buy scoundrels who were looking for some money acceptable\\, although I believe that Kylo Ren could have been misled in his vision or deliberately lying to Rey in order to entice her to the dark side. Its unacceptable\\, however\\, to set up the mysterious villain Snoke only to kill him off with no backstory whatsoever. I thought they would have learned from Darth Maul that a good villain needs to have a history and some importance to the story other than a place holder so that Kylo can become leader of the First Order. Another scene that throws out all context of the movies that came before was when Luke tossed away his lightsaber. In TFA\\, we see the lightsaber calling out to Rey telling her to seek her destiny\\, suggesting she has ties to the lightsaber if not to Luke himself. All this subplot is thrown out for a cheap joke\\, not to mention the memories that his lightsaber should bring back of Obi Wan and his early adventures.\\nProblem 2: Characters are out of character. I don't buy that Luke Skywalker would give up on his nephew so quickly to consider killing him so he wouldn't be driven to the dark side. In the original trilogy\\, Luke Skywalker wasn't afraid of Darth Vader or the Emperor\\, why would he be so afraid of his own pupil. This leads to Luke refusing to help Rey which is a lost moment to show Luke as a mentoring figure. Secondly\\, the new leader of the resistance is so adamant in not sharing her plan that it leads to a failed side mission and a mutiny. In previous films\\, the rebels were very much more democratic in their planning and used to sit round in large meetings to share their plans. This felt like another plot element to just serve itself in extending the movie and to show how much Poe needs to grow as a leader. \\nProblem 3: The side mission was pointless. In a Star Wars story\\, (any story really) when you have characters split to accomplish separate goals\\, each mission should be just as important as the other. This was true in A New Hope when Obi Wan turned off the power and Luke and Han freed Princess Leia. It was true in Empire when Luke went off to seek out Yoda and the crew had to dock at Cloud City. It was also true in Return of the Jedi when the rebels were working hard to take out the shield while Luke went to confront his father and the emperor. In this movie however\\, while the initial reason for the mission seems important\\, in the end it didn't matter if Rose and Finn failed or succeeded which leads the viewer to realize they've just wasted half an hour or so of story watching something irrelevant. If the two were doomed to fail\\, then that failure should mean something to the whole of the story other than an excuse for Poe to mutiny\\, the story to introduce us to the poor force sensitive kid\\, and for Finn to fight Phasma. It is this that leads me to my final frustration with this movie.\\nProblem 4: Plot holes. If you can destroy huge ships just by plowing through them while going to hyperspace\\, then why couldn't the rebels have done this throughout the war? It wouldn't be hard to create a drone ship capable of going to hyperspace to take out any number of death stars and capital ships. How does a rebel capital ship out run a star destroyer when even the Millennium Falcon could not outrun one? If you hire a scoundrel that you don't know and don't trust\\, why would you tell him anything that he doesn't need to know? If Luke truly wanted to separate himself from the force and hide why was there a map pointing to Ach Tu and why did he choose the first Jedi temple to live? That doesn't seem like a place you would go if you wanted to abandon the force and all your Jedi teaching. \\nIn conclusion\\, I think this movies serves the audience who just wants to watch a space movie\\, but does not serve those who are looking for a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
