Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not like the humor in this film\\, Star Wars is not supposed to humorous. The back story on Snoke is non to speak of. The way Luke Skywalker is portrayed is awful. This was my least favorite Star Wars film of the eight.","true":true}
