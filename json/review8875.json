Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the \\\"middle movie\\\"- pretty awesome. what you think should happen? Maybe it won't... maybe it did. Unexpected outcomes\\, unexpected characters\\, old story lines and archetypal ingredients that came across as new... twists that flip your ego on its head...  And finally\\, unexpected underlying themes that leave wide open new horizons for the Star Wars storyline. Bottom line\\, I cried\\, I laughed\\, I held my breath. I'm just a little fan since a girl and I need to see this one again.","true":true}
