Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awful. They've killed off all the.original characters in horrible ways and the new cast is soulless and have no real our explainable motivations. \\nIve seen every Star Wars movie in theaters on opening day. Disney has made me not care about Star Wars.\\n\\nStupid C3P0 has more personality and is more likeable and compelling than all of the new characters. I cared more about his outcome when he was in pieces being carried around on Chewie's back in ESB. And C3P0 is just a dumb talking Nintendo that can't make facial expressions. The idiot can't even blink and hes a better character than any of the new cast.\\n\\nThis movie is hollow and completely devoid of feeling.","true":true}
