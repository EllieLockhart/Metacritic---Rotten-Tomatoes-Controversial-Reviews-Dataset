Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers: Rian Johnson is hands down the worst thing ever to happen to the Star Wars franchise. It's from the Star Trek Discovery school of entertainment. If you approach it as generic sci fi channel production it's actually fairly enjoyable. But it's when you try to approach it as a Star Wars property it does literally nothing with what it has available to it. It takes Luke\\, a much loved character and turns him into a bitter old hermit\\, throwing out decades of character development for the sake of a cheap twist that adds nothing while being completely unbelievable and out of character. It's not Luke you'll be watching. It's the body snatcher version of Luke. I want to know what they did with the optimistic young man who would bet his life that the good he saw in his father could bring him back from the darkness. Then there are the new characters. They are all great characters who deserve better than what they've been given. The Last Jedi should have been called Attack of the Author Avatars. There's not a single believable character among them. And that's incredibly frustrating\\, because I like the characters\\, their background\\, I like the actors\\, I want to see them become compelling and interesting characters\\, but right now they basically breeze through whatever is thrown at them. At this point Star Wars is the most expensive fan fic ever made. Each of the new characters gets the typical heroes journey\\, but they are fast tracked so hard it makes it completely unbelievable. Instead of having to work to get better at things they immediately get whatever they need thrown at them with little rhyme nor reason. When they make mistakes\\, Deus Ex Machina plot conveniences appear to save them from having to deal with the realities of thier mistakes. When they meet an Antagonist\\, well lets just say that any Antagonist who directly confronts a protagonist in this movie either folds like a cheap suit\\, or gets punked. The writer has also forgotten all the things that were teased\\, set up\\, or built up in the first movie. Knights of Ren\\, not mentioned\\, who Snoke is\\, well if you thought you were getting answers\\, hah... who Rey's parents are gets about three sentences of casual dialogue. It's the most anticlimactic sequel I've watched since Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I'm going to say it again\\, because I don't think this can be stated enough\\, Rian Johnson is hands down the worst thing ever to happen to the Star Wars franchise. And the reason the critic reviews differ from user reviews is because critics these days are just a bunch of sheep who seem to be absolutely terrified of deviating from the collective in their views of what's good or bad.","true":true}
