Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most definitely the worst star wars movie I have ever seen. It filled with countless plot holes\\, pointless side story\\, Terrible charcters\/character development\\, far too much political views and most importantly it disrespects the Source material and the fans. If you love Star Wars\\, like I have all my life\\, don't see this movie spare your self the heart ache and disappointment.","true":true}
