Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm only giving this a review as a futile battle against the barrage of self-righteous \\\"fans.\\\" This movie is fine. Does it have problems? Yes. It's too long by like an hour\\, Snoke is poorly handled for the most part and there are some glaring plot problems. But it's gorgeous\\, I actually loved the Luke and Rey choices\\, and Kylo Ren is probably the second best Star Wars villain behind Vader (and no\\, Darth Maul was not a good villain\\, he was a good design). So it's fine. It didn't ruin your childhood. It's just a story and Rian Johnson is just a person. So chill. Stop with the hate mail and the insults and the poorly written curses. Let go of your anger - anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side. Please Star Wars fans\\, don't let me down. Because honestly\\, right now\\, I'm ashamed to be one of you.","true":true}
