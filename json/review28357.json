Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"POSSIBLE SPOILERS\\nIt had moments but mostly diravative. I have seen the battle on a snow world vs at-at (sorry salt world). I remember luke being taken to see the emporer in hand cuffs and felling the conflict in vader  (this time is rey being taken to snoke). \\n\\nwasted characters.... I can't get emotional about laura Derns sacrafice when the character was introduced 1 hour before.\\n\\nLukes big battle was great. Few funny moments. Rey still sucks.","true":true}
