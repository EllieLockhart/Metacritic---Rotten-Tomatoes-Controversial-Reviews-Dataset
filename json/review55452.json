Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite Star Wars movie besides Empire. Loved the performances of all the actors involved in the film. The story was interesting and very well directed. The mystery between the connection of Kylo Ren and Rey kept me very intrigued and I loved the bit with the green milk the Luke drank; it made me laugh! Don't understand all the hate?!","true":true}
