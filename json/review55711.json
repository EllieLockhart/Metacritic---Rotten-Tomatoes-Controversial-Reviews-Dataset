Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most important elements of a film within a trilogy\\, and more importantly a saga\\, is the acknowledgment of previous films and characters that came before it. This film not only subverts the characters that have been developed and understood over decades\\, but even worse - it completely subverts the film that came before it within the same trilogy! All questions of plot and character development\\, that were set up in the previous film\\, were either ignored\\, unanswered or contradicted.\\n\\nAs a stand alone film\\, this would be somewhat understandable\\, despite the unnecessary plot diversions (canto bight scenes). But that's exactly where this film fails. It is not a stand alone film and should not have been treated as such by the director. The weaponising of hyperspace is one example that completely undermines all logic of previous space battles\\, and dangerously challenges the existing understanding of how the Star Wars universe works on multiple levels. There are also many examples where important characters were discarded into subplots and\/or narratively mistreated in comparison to their representation in previous films (Luke\\, Snoke\\, Fin\\, Chewbacca\\, Leia\\, Yoda\\, Admiral Akbar and Phasma to name a few). Of these\\, sadly Luke was the most contradicted character.\\n\\nAside from all this - the cinematography was great\\, sound design excellent as always\\, VFX and SFX were very good- as you would expect from a large budget film. The location settings were interesting visually\\, but somewhat unimaginative in comparison to previous Star Wars films. \\n\\nIt breaks my heart to see such a beloved franchise treated this way by a director who clearly had little care for the Star Wars Universe\\, and the worst part is that the overseers at Disney let this movie into cinemas. For such a large organisation\\, I'm surprised by the extreme lack of quality control by Disney. I'm sure they will recover from this\\, and that important lessons have been learned\\, so I'm not worried about the franchise overall. However I do hope that future Star Wars films are written and produced with more thought and care.","true":true}
