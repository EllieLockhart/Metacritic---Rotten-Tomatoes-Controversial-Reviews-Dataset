Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just rewatched in preparation of Rise of Skywalker\\, and it is still the worst Star Wars ever made. Everything set up in Force Awakens is thrown out the window just for the sake of subverting expectations. Unlikeable characters\\, few and terrible action sequences\\, a lot of sitting around waiting for fuel to run out\\, and the dumbest side quest to Canto Bight that goes nowhere. The worst part is the betrayal of Luke's character. We are supposed to believe that the same Luke who was willing to die in order to bring his father back from the dark side would now be so quick to murder another family member merely for the possibility that he might be influenced by Snoke? Rian Johnson obviously is not a Star Wars fan and should stay far\\, far away from this galaxy. The Mandalorian stands in stark contrast to this abomination and feels like the true Star Wars we all know and love.","true":true}
