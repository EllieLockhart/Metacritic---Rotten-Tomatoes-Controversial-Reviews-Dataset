Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just crap. First half is not as bad (I can even pass flying Leia)\\, but the moment I realized Finn's and Rose mission is useless and pointless and Holdo's or whatever her name was didn't have ANY reason to not tell Poe about the plan things went straight to the gutter. Notice how starting there the movie just falls on its face with every frame. The fucking movie is filled with plot holes and the script its just horrible. I fucking laughed out loud at the cinema when Rose saves Finn (which is terrible because she could have died or he could have died anyway) and tells him \\\"love will saves us all\\\" or some crap\\, gives him a kiss and then faints. That alone will give you a good idea of what kind of shitfest this movie is. The jokes are bad\\, they didn't land at all. The porgs suck. Characters have no actual development. Many things setup in Force Awakens were straight up ignored here. RIan Johnson just destroyed Luke's character entirely and so on. Just so many things wrong. I didn't went to the theaters to see Solo and I won't be seeing Episode 9. I already made a decision I won't keep following this franchise or contributing to it in any way with my wallet until this shitfest is declared non canon. No matter how decent Epidode 9 turns out it won't save this crap. Star Wars is dead to me as it is. Congrats Rian Johnson! You made it! You were able to destroy a whole franchise years in the making by one of your turds. That's quite an accomplishment.","true":true}
