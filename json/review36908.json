Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was fantastic and deserves more than some of those half stars on the site. The acting was perfect and the development of the new and old characters really moved the story in a new direction that Lucas would never have the guts to move it to. The Last Jedi is really something special and unique and I believe is one of the best Star Wars films I have seen. It makes me happy that they didn\u2019t reuse the Death Star plot that they have done it 1\/3 of the movies. It\u2019s fresh and bold in the direction that it moves the series. ","true":true}
