Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fits perfectly in the Star Wars Canon Universe. It is fresh\\, with unexpected twists and some of the most amazing scenes ever filmed for a Star Wars movie. The few nitpicked issues I identified in the movie\\, should not take away any of the enjoyment; even from the most fervent Star Wars fans.","true":true}
