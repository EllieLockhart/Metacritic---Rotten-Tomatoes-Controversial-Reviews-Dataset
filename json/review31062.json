Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I just got home from watching this and I am very disappointed\\, my complaints are about the same complaints I had with ep7 and also the same complaints I had with most movies over the last few years Hollywood is to busy with it's head up it's own ass to actually see and hear what would make fans happy. It's really sad and they end making shit tons of money before it hits the streets with what a nothing burger this movie was.","true":true}
