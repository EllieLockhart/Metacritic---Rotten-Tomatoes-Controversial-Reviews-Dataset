Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks good sounds good and if you dont care about plot or substance its ok. not a starwars movie in my mind. so many plot holes and frustrating scenes. what they have done to luke skywalker is unforgivable. Also leave the political agenda bs out of star wars please. doubt i will pay to watch another star wars film again.","true":true}
