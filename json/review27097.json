Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the three most exciting Star Wars films I've ever seen\\, and truly the most daring and reverent of them. I don't know that anyone has made a Star Wars film since A New Hope who has loved this world more than Rion Johnson. And the throne room scene has the greatest fight scene in all of Star Wars.","true":true}
