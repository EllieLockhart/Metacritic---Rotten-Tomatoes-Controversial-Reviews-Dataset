Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the theater feeling betrayed.... thanks. I can't understand how this film is sitting at a 46% audience score. I got six pages into audience reviews and noted the majority were .5 to 2 stars. Something has to be done to improve things at Lucas films.","true":true}
