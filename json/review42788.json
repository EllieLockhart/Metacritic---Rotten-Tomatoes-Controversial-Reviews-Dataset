Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was long\\, a mess and defiled what Star Wars is\/was. The prequels with some of the bad choices it had\\, still had a point and a good story. This movie made no sense and was all over the place. Pathetic excuse for a Star Wars movie and a middle finger to any Star Wars faithful who grew up watching the Original Trilogy when it first came out. A large percentage of Star Wars die hards will be angry\\, bummed\\, depressed and shocked by this pile of garbage. This movie will not be a part of my collection.","true":true}
