Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I both loved and hated this movie. I had to see it twice to make sure I understood what happened. There are scenes that are brilliant and full of emotion beyond what is in previous Star Wars films. I think Adam Driver\\n and Daisy Ridley are phenomenal in this film. That being said\\, There are some major plot holes and silliness that could have been cut out. Finn and Rose were sent on a ridiculous wild goose chase. Poe's character development was stupid and would have landed him in the brig. I still think it was an overall ok film. I hope that some more backstory will be explained in next film and hope that Kylo RENs character will develop more fully. It's not the worst Star Wars movie but it's not the best either\\, which is a shame because it really could have been without some of the weird side plots. It felt like it just had too much going on. I think they should have taken longer to make the film. Finn and Poe on a mission would have made more sense. I don't really understand what they were trying to do with the weird side mission. I think I know where that are headed in the next one with Rey and Kylo and it could be great. I just hope they don't screw it up","true":true}
