Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was everything I hoped it would be and more I have seen it three times already and like it even more each time. I love the different takes on the Star Wars universe and the opening it leaves for greatness to come from anywhere. I\u2019m so excited about having new material for the future of the franchise!!","true":true}
