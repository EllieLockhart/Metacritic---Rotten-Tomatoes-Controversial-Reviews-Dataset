Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The films cinematography is beautiful and the writing continues to demonstrate a higher quality since Disney took the helm.  The film was a little long in the middle\\, and scenes like Luke milking a water donkey were probably superfluous.  It will also likely irk the rare fanboy who considers themselves a Star Wars expert\\, particularly the way snoke dies.  However\\, those same individuals like Jar Jar Binks and probably still have a VHS recording of the 1980s holiday special and actually think it's good... I found snokes death satisfying and true to spirit of the Sith.  \\nThe balance of Action and Story was in harmony and I was thoroughly entertained by the latest release\\, and already waiting for the next chapter.","true":true}
