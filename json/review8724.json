Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a Disney Sci-Fi flick it is pretty fun to watch. But as the 8th installment of the Star Wars saga\\, it is utterly confusing. I've been a fan of Star Wars my entire life. I saw the phantom menace in theaters when I was 9. Watching episode 5 on vhs\\, I remember the feeling when Vader told Luke the infamous line \\\"...I am your father\\\". This goes against everything in the lore. It almost seems the writers and directors knew nothing about the saga and quite frankly\\, don't give a damn. \\\"Let it die\\\" was something everyone was uttering during the whole movie. I believe that is what Rian J was doing when he signed off on this movie. \\n\\nBottom line is when you are in charge of a movie franchise\\, it is your responsibility to know the entire lore of something before you decide to create an addition. Not just burn books of the past in order to save some time and money researching just to do your own thing. This was the worst excuse of a Star Wars film yet.","true":true}
