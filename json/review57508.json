Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disappointment.  The character of Luke Skywalker was completely destroyed.  In Episodes IV\\, V and VI\\, Luke was never scared or afraid and he never gave up on his friends and loved ones.  This is also the first Star Wars Episode to NOT feature a light VS dark lightsaber duel.  They swung their lightsabers around\\, but they never once crossed.  \\n\\nAdditionally\\, it's like everything from the first movie was completely thrown out.  Many questions from The Force Awakens were left unanswered and the one that was answered was done in the most underwhelming way possible.  Even the nice set up at the end of Force Awakens where Rey hands Luke his lightsaber was destroyed by Rian Johnson by having Luke toss it over his shoulder in a slap stick manner.  They try to trick you into thinking it was a good movie by throwing a lot of action and humor at you\\, but when you stop and process the movie as a whole\\, you realize that it's actually pretty terrible.  Here's hoping JJ fixes these issues in Episode IX.","true":true}
