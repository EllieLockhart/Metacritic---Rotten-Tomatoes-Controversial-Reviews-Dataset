Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead.  How disappointing it ended this way.  Good luck to the new Star J Wars.  I'm sure it will make tons of money and have EPIC graphics.  However with Luke's cowardly death I'm thinking now is probably a good time to bow out.","true":true}
