Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing this opening night\\, I'm still not sure which is worse....The Last Jedi or November 8th\\, 2016?   This movie is a far cry from Rogue One!  WAY too many cheesy comedy one-liners.  Star Wars movies should be epic classics that you want to watch over and over\\, but when it's littered with bad comedy\\, watching it a 2nd or 3rd time just becomes annoying.  I hope Episode 9 is better...","true":true}
