Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies ever crafted. Unpredictable. Star Wars fans\\, you are not movie directors. You are not the writer. Or the cinematographer. When you complain that episode 7 was just a rehash of 4\\, then complain that 8 is too different... what you want is a theoretical perfect circle. Aka the perfect Star Wars movie. Hindsight is easy. Create a film\\, of this magnitude\\, with as much love as Rian put in\\, and watch as everyone becomes armchair directors. This is miles ahead of episodes 1-3. We have depth. Growth. A slow burn opening. For those that think it is too slow of a start\\, go back to our ADHD riddled culture of instant gratification. Not every movie is about giving you an instant rush. Let it sink in\\, change your opinions. Don\u2019t have hard hearts. This movie isn\u2019t perfect. Yeah\\, the Leia scene was awkward. Some dialogue was a bit cheesy. But it had more heart\\, more soul\\, than most movies. Amazing color and cinematography. Great twists. Kyle Ren was perfect. He is the fanboy of Vader that falls short. His mixed emotions are amazing. People want perfect people in their movies. Perfect villains. Perfect heroes. No. Give me flawed characters. People that feel real\\, with mixed emotions that pull them everywhere. Peace and love. ","true":true}
