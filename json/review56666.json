Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a movie that had it's faults\\, but I though was the overall a good movie. I wish certain things had been done\\, such as a reworking the code breaker subplot and possibly less abrupt cuts between scene\\, but i found that for the most part the humor and tension worked well. And the code breaker subplot is fine with me\\, considering we need something a little more upbeat (mostly) to break up the tension and stress of the rest of the movie for kids. The best parts about this movie are undoubtedly any scene with Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren. My only regret is that there wasn't a long scene with all three of them together. There were plenty of interactions and twists that I saw coming and still enjoyed\\, and quite a few I didn't expect. \\n\\nThe main ones coming to mind being how the 'bond' between Rey and Kylo Ren was shown (cinematic genius\\, and perfectly illustrates how jarring a connection like that is for them)\\, Luke's grand Reappearance(!!)\\, Luke and You-know-who(!!!!!) having a chat over a campfire\\, and the affection between Rey and Finn\\, which I hope we'll see more of. There are a few other scenes I liked\\, but I can't really describe them without spoiling the movie.\\n\\nI'll also admit that I enjoyed seeing Poe sufferer and grow as a person\\, but for different reasons to why I liked the other scenes. It's nice to occasionally see the good guys realize that they can't be as reckless as they want to be\\, and grow from that . And that happened a lot in this movie: character growth. My biggest worry moving forward is that the next movie doesn't follow up on this growth\\, but I guess I'll just have to wait and see.\\n\\nSo overall a movie I enjoyed\\, and one that I recommend you go see before passing judgement on. It won't please everyone\\, but it sure pleased me.","true":true}
