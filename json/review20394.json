Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand that someone hacked RT.....stupid....\\n\\nI've seen every Star Wars many times...I'm a true fan\\, and this latest is the best of all of them...to me.\\n\\nRay steels the show and the ending was a pleasant surprise for everyone.. Daisy Ridley gives a memorable performance....so much so that this is now my favorite Star Wars Rendition.","true":true}
