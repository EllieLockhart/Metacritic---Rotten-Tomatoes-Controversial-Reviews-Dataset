Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed. Don\u2019t trust fake profile reviews. Mostly with how they portrayed Luke. For someone who was excited for his return it was painful and disappointing to see him milk a nipple and basically be crazy the entire movie and SERIOUSLY the Luke who never gave up on Vader is going to kill his nephew!! Sorry Mark Hamil. You ruined Luke Disney. Also the humor was painful at times and seemed like a marvel movie rather than true Star Wars. Saddest thing is this can\u2019t be undone. ","true":true}
