Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This soulless cash grab -I mean movie- almost ruined Star Wars for me. If you want to watch Star Wars watch the original trilogy and even the prequels. I wish more care had been taken when attempting to add one of the most globally beloved franchises ever. This movie was no only a waste of time but was an insult to Star Wars.","true":true}
