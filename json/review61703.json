Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I unterstand why people are pissed. They don\u2018t like how the game killed off Joel and say that the story doesn\u2018t make sense. In my opinion it does. Of course\\, the fact that the doctor\\, Joel killed at the end of TLOU 1\\, hat a daughter that would hunt down her dads killer seems kinda random. In my opinion the story still makes sense. In the world of the Last of Us\\, people don\u2019t die like heroes they just get shot or whatever and that\u2019s it. The enemies you kill are just getting shot or stabbed and die without much drama and so do our protagonists. Joel\\, who forgot how to trust while living in his peaceful little town Jackson\\, Jesse surprisingly getting shot in the face by Abby and so on.Also\\, Ellie is not better than Abby. They both kill with no regrets\\, the only reason you hate Abby and love Ellie is\\, that you know her from the first game.At first I hated Abby as well but playing her backstory made me like her more and more.The only thing that really pissed me off is the ending.From the point on\\, where Ellie and Dina live on the farm\\, with Jessie\u2019s Baby etc. the game felt kinda weird. Ellie looked weird\\, Abby looked like a totally different person\\, the whole thing just felt like a different game in the last few ours.The Gameplay is not the best but actually improved a lot and is way more extensive and better to control then in the first game.All in all I think that\\, even though the fame gets way too much hate\\, its a masterpiece and next to Part 1\\, one of naughty dogs best games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
