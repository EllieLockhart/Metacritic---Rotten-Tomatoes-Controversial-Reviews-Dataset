Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor story line and a remake of episode 5. We were promised so much more than the light and and the dark side\\, but in the end that's all we got from this movie. Adding nothing interesting to bring back customers for the next movie. Rain Johnson and Disney are not passionate about Star Wars and will slowly kill the franchise. If this were to be an actual book it should be rejected for lack of a congruent story line. The cartoon series \\\"the clone wars\\\" is the only thing Disney can do right. Where was the promised reveal of where did snoke come from how is he so powerful. Why did you make the most powerful Jedi\\, Luke\\, into a crazy lunatic. The ship that snoke piloted was just another Death Star and a lame story.","true":true}
