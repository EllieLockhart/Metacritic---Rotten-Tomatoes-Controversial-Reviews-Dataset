Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it.  It's hard to review this without spoilers\\, but they did everything right in this movie.  They addressed many of my frustrations from the 7th movie\\, and put a cork in a couple of the \\\"flaws\\\" others saw in that movie.\\n\\n****SPOILERS BELOW******\\n\\n\\nWe finally get to see Leia use the force - which was satisfying\\, as in almost all of the literature she is one of the most powerful Jedi in the Universe.\\n\\nLuke gets a completely fitting ending.\\n\\nI don't get Kylo's head on a pike\\, but it looks like he stays a villain - so my Christmas wish just might come true in the future\\, and as a bonus - I get a dead Snoke.\\n\\nANYWAY\\, it is a fantastic addition to the series\\, and really rises above episode 7 (in my mind).  \\n\\nAlso\\, they don't blow up a big circular death machine at the end.  Here's to hoping that also doesn't happen in episode 9.","true":true}
