Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am never watching this movie again. It disrespects its characters\\, and it is a insult to the original trilogy. The writer\/director destroys characters at the expense of a joke. This is a good example of not understanding\\, the source material\\, the characters or the universe. Such a missed opportunity\\, and unfortunate that Disney did not invest themselves in this franchise. It is clear Disney only used our beloved characters as bait\\, to have us watch this movie. Poor story telling\\, boring sequences\\, and it violates all the world building of previous movies.","true":true}
