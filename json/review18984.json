Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's by no means a flawless film\\, scenes that I don't like and some scenes that I feel Disney insisted be included are littered in places through the film. However for the first time in years a Star Wars film has been clever\\, surprising\\, bold in its risk taking and at the same time expertly directed and filmed. Cinematography is amazing\\, despite it's problems I couldn't be happier with this film being what it is\\, after the very safe movies Disney has done so far. It's a departure from the vapid cookie cutter movie format that Marvel has stormed to success with and I pray it's a departure that is here to stay.","true":true}
