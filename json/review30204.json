Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it on Blu Ray\\, and found myself bored to death. The new characters don't seem to belong and I cared little about the scenes given to them. Had moments watching it thinking \\\"when is this horror show going to end\\\"\\n\\nI came into this movie hopeful that Luke Skywalker would have a great role in this film. Turns out he's a pathetic and cowardly old man\\, honestly this did not even feel like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
