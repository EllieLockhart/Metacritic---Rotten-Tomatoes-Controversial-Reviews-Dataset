Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was a fan of the previous films but did not prejudice this work with the plotlines and characters from the other films. Luke is much older and as show been through much more. His character reflected that. \\nThe special effects were outstanding. New characters were believable and had real personalities. I really enjoyed this movie.","true":true}
