{"101487":133297,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had a lot to say about this fllm\\, but most of it has already been said. \\n\\nAt the end of the day\\, your enjoyment of this film just depends on the kind of person you are. If you are going to get mad that they new things with the force\\, despite almost every Star Wars doing new things with the force (Empire expanded the Jedi abilities significantly\\, Jedi expanded the Sith abilities\\, the prequels ruined the force altogether). If you're going to get upset with anything\\, be mad at Rebels\\, which introduced the Force feature most are complaining about. \\n\\nIf you're going to get upset with bombs \\\"falling\\\" in space\\, then you might as well get upset with the gravity on ships (if they fall in the ship\\, out into zero gravity\\, guess what they keep doing). I mean\\, if you get upset with the Star Wars universe not working with how you want it to work\\, then you probably won't enjoy this movie that much.\\n\\nIf you want the Empire version of the Force Awakens\\, then you'll be really disappointed.\\n\\nAfter the Force Awakens I had a good idea of what to expect from the rest of the trilogy. I imagine most did. People weren't coming up with theories on how the overall play of the trilogy might differ from the other trilogies. They were coming up with theories on who was this person or that person or who might change sides\\, etc. The same stuff we've been speculating about since Empire (which just adds to its credit). Coming out of the Last Jedi I can honestly say I have no idea what the heck is going to happen in Episode 9! And that's a good thing!\\n\\nThe Last Jedi essentially picks up where The Force Awakens left off\\, and ends about 24 hours later. Its an examination of one of the most critical moments in a war. Where one side can finish it once and for all. Obviously\\, the First Order doesn't wipe everyone out in the end\\, and despite a huge setback\\, there's hope on the horizon. So\\, in the big picture\\, the film doesn't \\\"move\\\" the plot along\\, as some love to complain. That doesn't mean there isn't a point.  That's like saying there was no point to Dunkirk because at the end the war hadn't moved along.\\n\\nSo really\\, it just depends on the kind of person you are. That's why its such a great film. If you're racist or sexist and only enjoy films where white men are the heroes\\, you'll be disappointed to know that there's only 2 or 3 white men main characters who are epic. Yea\\, you'll hate this film. \\n\\nYea\\, there's a few weird things we can universally agree upon are kind of odd\\, or they don't make sense. I dare you to point me to a Star Wars (or any film really) that doesn't have things that don't make sense (so you're leaving Hoth and there's literally an entire planet you can fly out of\\, why the heck would you fly right next to the ships that shoot at you? How long can a tan-tan's guts stay warm? So\\, if Boba Fett follows Han to cloud city\\, and he reports to the empire where the Falcon is going\\, how did they arrive before our heroes\\, as Lando explains later? Why is there gravity like\\, literally everywhere\\, even inside the asteroid monster? Why doesn't all the contents of the Falcon get sucked out when they leave the door open? Etc\\, etc) I mean\\, if you can't suspend your disbelief for this film\\, despite having to do it for all other Star Wars films\\, then you'll hate what they do here.\\n\\nWhere was I? Oh yea\\, we all agree there's some stuff that falls flat\\, like the casino\\, or the milk scene for some (some thought it was the best scene in the film). Yes\\, a lot of it can be considered a big F.U. to the earlier films. Or it can be considered taking us step by step through the process of letting go of the earlier conventions so that we can move on to a new story\\, with new ideas\\, and a new overall plot. Just depends on how you look at it\\, or you can say\\, from a certain point of view.\\n\\nPersonally\\, I loved it. There's definitely some valid arguments for why things don't make sense\\, and if you want to let that ruin the Star Wars universe for you\\, that's on you. I am going to watch it many times over\\, put up 5 stars\\, and debate its quality with friends\\, like I did with the prequels\\, but on the other side of the fight this time. I thinks its worth it. \\n\\nJust remember\\, when you're writing up a response to someone (or me)\\, all mad that they disagree with you and think this film didn't ruin Star Wars completely\\, and completely mad and pissed off and start calling people names like idiots\\, and such. Remember what anger leads to. Remember that these films honor the light side of the force. Take a moment\\, take a breath\\, and let the force be with you. If that doesn't help\\, then maybe Star Wars was lost upon you long before The Last Jedi.\\n\\n(speaking of\\, why don't the Sith say \\\"May be the Force be with you\\\" as well? It doesn't quantify the light side of the force\\, just \\\"the force\\\" being with you. The Sith want the force to be with them as well\\, right? Anyway\\, just a thought.)","true":true}
