Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's face it: The new trilogy is not so much a continuation of the old movies\\, it's a more of a reboot. It's admittedly an awkward one because the old characters could not be ignored. Disney had to insert the old characters to please the fans but they really weren't necessary. It would have been better that way. It would have been a clean cut.\\nI've got to admit that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" has its moments. But they don't fit together to a satisfying whole. It has its laughs. But because of them\\, the movie is somehow tone-deaf. We see the dramatic\\, if not tragic\\, decimation of the Resistance\\, All that's left of the Resistance at the end of the movie can be rescued with the Millennium Falcon which is not a very big ship to begin with. And Leiy shrugs the tragedy away with\\, like\\, \\\"We have everything we need\\\". Really? Add the cheap laughs about Chewbacca going vegetarian and Luke tossing away his light-saber and you'll get a very unbalanced picture. And let's not mention the Canto Bight sequence. \\n I can see that Rian Johnson didn't want to become too repetitive. He re-used some stuff from episodes VI and V but where the original trilogy went straight ahead\\, he decided to do sharp left turns. There is an element of surprise here\\, no doubt about it\\, but that way those parts don't fit into the greater whole. Snoke is dispatched very quickly by Kylo\\, good riddance\\, but that way all the buildup that has been done in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" goes south. His origin story isn't important anymore (by the way: The original trilogy wasn't also very keen to explain the background of e.g. Palpatine\\, AFAIK his name isn't even mentioned in all three original films\\, you have to read the novelization to learn a bot more of his origin). \\nAfter I left the theater\\, I had to chew quite a few days about the movie. And then I decided not to watch it again and not to care anymore about Episode IX.","true":true}
