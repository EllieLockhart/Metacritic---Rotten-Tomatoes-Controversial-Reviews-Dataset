Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of \\\"The Skywalker Saga\\\"\\, The Last Jedi is my favorite. It really did breath fresh air into Star Wars (for me). It was different. It was character driven. It set up the potential for something so much more than what The Rise of Skywalker was. I was excited to see a movie wherein the legend of Luke Skywalker was the spark to lit the fire that would be the Resistance: a heartfelt story of how the Force united a galaxy to come together in its darkest hour. That's the story The Last Jedi set up\\, and it set it up very well. I enjoyed Luke's character in TLJ. He's human\\, like the rest of us. I was discouraged to hear Mark Hamill's thoughts on Luke in TLJ. Here I am\\, having thoroughly enjoyed the movie\\, and all I can read about is the actors distancing themselves from their own movie. Apparently I think more highly of TLJ than its own actors. I am disappointed we didn't get to see a payoff to Rian Johnson's tee up. Maybe if we're patient\\, in 30 years\\, Disney will make another sequel trilogy and we'll get a proper sequel to TLJ. Although I fear the Emperor will somehow still be alive...again...for no apparent reason... Anyway\\, long story short: The Last Jedi was a great movie!","true":true}
