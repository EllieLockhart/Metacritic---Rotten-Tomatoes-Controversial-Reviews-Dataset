Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete disgrace to the Star Wars fan base. It makes a complete mockery out of the Star Wars mythology and universe. All of the questions raised by JJ Abrams in the previous movie was trashed and left unanswered. Truly I have never felt more disappointed in a film's work. Neither the storyline\\, cinematography\\, character development\\, or set design seemed to come together at any point in the film. Even if you took away everything that the Star Wars universe revolves around\\, this film was poorly made and is a shameful iteration of the Star Wars saga. I'm not sure how you could possibly make a sequel to the next film and I'm actually glad carrie fisher isn't here to witness any of these poor reviews. I wish I would have left in the middle of the movie and demanded a refund for this preposterous film. (And just so you know I've never taken the time to actually leave a review for any film on rotten tomatoes\\, but I feel a moral obligation to warn anyone with any inkling of interest in the Star Wars films to avoid watching this movie completely).","true":true}
