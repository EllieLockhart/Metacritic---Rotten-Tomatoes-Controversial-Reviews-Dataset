Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is ruining Star Wars. They basically killed off all the characters that made Star Wars great in the first place. They made a terrible choice in Lea's story\\, they should have killed her off. Now they have to come up with a way to explain her death\\, off screen. Luke's death was completely meaningless and was a complete waste of his character. The Rose-Finn arc made no sense and didn't contribute anything to the overall story. Rey's character doesn't make any sense\\, she just happens to be incredibly strong in the force with no training what so ever. Snoke was another completely wasted character. Hopefully Disney thinks about what they have done with this once great universe\\, and make amends with the true Star Wars fans.","true":true}
