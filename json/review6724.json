Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't let the bad parts ruin your experience. Every movie had bad parts (in particular The Force Awakens) and the diehard fans won't like it because in comparison to The Force Awakens\\, the bad parts don't work out into a \\\"Star Wars feeling\\\". I am a diehard fan too but I understood that this is the only way to save the franchise. If they would have made a movie that was exactly like The Empire Strikes Back\\, which ep VIII was totally going to become after what The Force Awakens set up\\, even the fans that loved The Force Awakens would have been really mad. Ryan Johnson understood that too and tried to make the best out of what The Force Awakens gave him. \\nOther than that\\, you must think about the other work he has done and that if you look at The Last Jedi really good you'll see that most of the bad parts are Disney's fault. I'm excited for a trilogy writen and directed by him because he obviously listens to what the fans think about the movies and he improves on it. Maybe next time he won't let Disney change the script so that they'll sell more toys.\\nThe Last Jedi is a wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe and a very interesting movie.","true":true}
