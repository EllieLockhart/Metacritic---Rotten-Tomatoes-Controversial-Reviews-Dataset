Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Last Jedi delivers some incredibly awesome visuals\\, the movie itself is very lack luster. A poor script\\, essentially stolen from the other movies\\, while the actual new lines are nearly similar to childish banter. Nothing about this movie is surprising as it was easily the most predictable\\, more so than the prequels when people knew how it would end. In all\\, this movie truly makes one appreciate the masterpiece that was the prequel trilogy.","true":true}
