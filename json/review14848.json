Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly can't believe that I'm saying this but The Last Jedi is even worse than the Force Awakens.\\nSwinging from the ridiculous to the obnoxious\\, the movie is a symposium of failure. Every character is thoroughly unlikeable\\, every scene a rabbit hole they just fall through\\, effecting nothing\\, as clods of fan service and god awful gags tumble them this way and that.\\nGaping plot holes\\, hokey logic\\, heroes who are idiots and ill conceived set pieces made this an eye rolling watch.\\n\\\"Kill the past\\, let it die\\\" Kylo Ren exclaims and I agree\\, if only I could kill the memory of the last 2hrs.","true":true}
