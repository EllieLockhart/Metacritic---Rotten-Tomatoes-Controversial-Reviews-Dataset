Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The few decent parts of this movie weren\u2019t enough to save it from being without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie possibly conceivable.","true":true}
