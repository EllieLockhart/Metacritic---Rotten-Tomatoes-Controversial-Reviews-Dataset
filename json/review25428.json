Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No one is perfect.  Accepting the fact Luke is flawed was an inspired creation.  Excellent movie.  The only truth is change happens\\, the Jedi may be gone\\, but are they really gone when the Force is always there.","true":true}
