Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What else can be said about this movie? I don't REALLY care what gender \/ race the characters are\\, just make the audience care about them. I don't feel anything towards the new characters\\, they can all trip and fall into a sarlac pit gor all i care. \\nmay the forced humor be with you","true":true}
