Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the force awakens had lots of problems with the story plot and characters and I hoped the next movie would fix them. instead they either ignored the problems or made them worse. what's more they proceeded to create more plot holes and problems. They decided to make a movie that was \\\"original\\\" .. ha.. instead of\\n something that had depth. it's a fail and now that this movie has failed to answer all the questions from the first I am doubtful that the third will redeem anything else. it's a sad sad day when the prequels are less destructive to star wars lore then the new movies.","true":true}
