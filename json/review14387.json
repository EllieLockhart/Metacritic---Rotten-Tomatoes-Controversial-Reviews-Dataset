Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high expectations for The Last Jedi and watched it with few spoilers but fan theories. I don't see the complaints viewers are leaving and it's all very silly fan boy disappointments they didn't get it exactly what they wanted. The writing\\, acting\\, directing and editing was A+. Every scene and tempo thoroughly thought through. I enjoyed the unexpected and trilogy diversion. Force Awakens was a safe production by JJ while RJ made bold moves. Go see it with an open mind and take in this well made gorgeous science fantasy. By the way Mark Hamil kills it in his roll!","true":true}
