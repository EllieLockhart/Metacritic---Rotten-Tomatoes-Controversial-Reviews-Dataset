Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down\\, the worst movie in the franchise. JUST. PLAIN. TERRIBLE. The acting is so brutal\\, I kept hoping the main characters would get killed so I wouldn't have to endure their pathetic acting. The characters just aren't likeable. Everything just seems so forced (pardon the pun). Please don't watch this movie!","true":true}
