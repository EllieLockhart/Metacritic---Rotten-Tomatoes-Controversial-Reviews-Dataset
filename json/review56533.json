Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi completely destroyed the basic storytelling technique of a hero's journey inspired by Joseph Campbell in the original Star Wars and pre-sequels. The Last Jedi threw out the basic stages which a hero or heroine must undergo to overcome challenges and gain self-awareness for the greater good. The original Star Wars' themes of loyalty to friends and mentors\\, the struggle to gain self-awareness\\, the struggle between good vs. evil\\, and the redemption of an evil father are powerful themes found in a hero's journey. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a muddle-ridden plot with characters I no longer care about and can even remember their names. There was an opportunity for the new characters to carry forward the torch with their own unique journeys\\, but instead the audience has to endure the horrible send-off of Luke and his legacy. Also thrown-out was the concept that insight and wisdom are gained from understanding the past and learning from wise mentors and teachers. \\n\\nAccording to this movie\\, you might as well destroy museums\\, historical accounts\\, mythology and legends\\, literature\\, and archaeological findings because it is no longer relevant to the present. What a misconception because the same basic issues keep repeating throughout history. That is why mythology has stood the test of time because it provides guidance and lessons to future generations who struggle to find their destiny. The movie completely lost sight of this. Needless to say\\, I'll never pay to see another Walt Disney Star Wars movie.","true":true}
