Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best looking Star Wars film to date and makes for an entertaining roller coaster ride filled with action. Unfortunately\\, the positives of this film is dragged down by the many plot holes\\, dropped storylines from The Force Awakens\\, and the disregard towards the established Star Wars lore.","true":true}
