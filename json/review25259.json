Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No character development\\, pointless subplots\\, terrible script. Oh and did any of y'all catch the flying toaster? This was worse than any of the prequels. \\nMaybe Disney could bring in a new writer and director and redo this film to set things right.","true":true}
