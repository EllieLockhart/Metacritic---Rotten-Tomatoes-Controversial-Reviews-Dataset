Some come really in hand.\r\rSubtitles - you can have subtitles yellow.\r\rTrophies - as a casual player this is very welcome\\, but can understand some people getting upset\\, there are no more trophies for completing the game on each difficulty\\, you get only one for completing the game\\, and now there are less stupid ones\\, like finding every audio interaction with npcs (thank god).\r\rGameplay time SPOILER FOR SOME PEOPLE--------------------------------------------------------------------------\rI played almost twenty five hours for the first play through (for a linear game.... oh boy)\\, the game seems to never and\\, and trying to play in one go can and probably will make you sick\\, so I recommend playing a In game day or so per real day (just an personal recommendation)\\, as it will also help in getting that intense story more spaced.\r\rFinal Thoughts - With this kind of direction I would play even if the main character was a schizophrenic clown\\, that in reality was a dead cat's nightmare\r\rhope we can have a tlou p3 or a Joel prequel some day\u2026 Expand","true":true}
