Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly rubbish. No part of this movie was good\\, there were cheesy disco-esque light saber fights but other than that\\, killed the trilogy and franchise. This is what happens when you hire a director who focuses on agenda and admittedly hates the original material. He forgot to make a sensical movie that conforms to the established SW universe.. I walked out of the opening night theater with friends and we were all angry and started tearing the movie to shreds scene by scene in disgust. Good luck turning over the ship JJ. This one is flushable.","true":true}
