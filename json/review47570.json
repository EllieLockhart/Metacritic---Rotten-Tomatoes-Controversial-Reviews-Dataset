Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the heck did I just watch? Definitely wasn't a Star Wars movies...more like a space movie with sprinkles of cheesy comedy\\, useless social justice characters and a whole mess of other irrelevant takes compared to the previous movie by JJ Abrams. Would not recommend. Hopefully episode 9 can spin this trilogy in the right direction. Meaning the complete opposite of this movie.","true":true}
