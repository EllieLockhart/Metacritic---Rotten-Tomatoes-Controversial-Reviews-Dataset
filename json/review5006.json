Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couple of good scenes... but a lot of garbage and a hollow film.  Portrayal of luke is rubbish.  Hire some actual writers of substance\\, so we can actually get a story experience vs. just a cgi setup for further installments\\, or you are going to kill your star wars cash cow.","true":true}
