Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was absolutely abysmal and provided no depth into the characters' backstories or traits. The entire plot was the same start to finish and did not progress at all\\, and overall was full of gaping holes. Why was the First Order not capable of destroying the Resistance for the entire movie when they're literally within range of them if they just sent TIE fighters out to destroy a practically defenseless ship. (We saw what Kylo Ren and other TIE fighters were able to do to the ship.) I saw this movie as an incredible opportunity to enrich the lore of Star Wars and give us a great story that\\, at times\\, does mirror the original saga. Nobody can lie\\, the parallels to the original saga in TFA\\, though extremely apparent\\, made the movie fail-proof but this movie went off in its own direction and because of that I regard this movie as a children's movie directed at very casual Star Wars fans as well as the most stereotypical happy ending movie ever. Not that happy endings are not great and imperative but in the case of this movie\\, the bad guys not getting the job done is extremely unrealistic\\, just like Leia somehow surviving the bridge of the resistance ship exploding leading her out into space\\, and makes the villains petty and hard to take seriously. Hopefully\\, JJ Abrams is able to salvage the saga\\, which seems possible if he takes episode 9 in the direction everyone thought TLJ would go. Final point\\, is wtf happened with the character of Snoke. It seemed like Rian Johnson did not want to deal with the character so he ousted him but only after Snoke is made to seem like an extremely powerful being\\, only to be undone by something so unfitting and unbelievable. Giving Snoke a rich backstory would've provided motivation for the entire entity that is the First Order other than they're just bad guys and it would've enriched the character\\, ultimately making the movie more immersive with developed characters. The movie could've been worse\\, but not by much. Man oh man\\, what TLJ could've been.","true":true}
