Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just signed up so I can say not to see Star Wars. Wait for red box release cause it's all it's really paying to see. I bought  tickets when they went on sale took off from work. When I walked out of theater I felt so empty. First star wars movie ever I truly hated.  The only emotion I have for this movie.  Whoever wrote this movie never saw a movie\\, talked to a fan\\,  and doesn't care about staying true to the genre.  My heart is broken.","true":true}
