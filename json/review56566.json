Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is a fun movie\\, it entertains you. But this is not the movie most star wars fans were hoping for\\, I think anyway. This movie doesn't fail to shock and keep you on the edge of your seat. But the most mysterious figures and their stories like Luke and Snoke are not done justice. We watch Snoke an entire one and a half episode for him to be cut down\\, not knowing anything about him. Why introduce a villian\\, make him have no impact in the films and tell nothing about him for 2 episodes? \\nEverything in the force awakens was about finding Luke and in this movie we get to see him. Not the way I was hoping for. The scene he first sees Rey and gets handed his and his father's lightsaber\\, sums up the movie in a nutshell. This is supposed to be a big moment\\, but it turns out so lackluster when Luke just flips the relic away like trash. The director wants to shock the audience so much\\, it ignores the feelings of the fans. Doing so\\, it will leave true star wars fans hopeless for the conclusion of the sequel trilogy.","true":true}
