Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review and likely to be my only one until the next Star Wars movie comes out\\, although after watching TLJ I'm not sure I will ever go to the cinema to see another SW movie again. I'm still sad and bitterly disappointed over what has been done to Star Wars. I had such high hopes for Luke to go out like the Jedi Hero he is\\, not to be destroyed by left wing\\, socialist\\, feminists who made every white male character either weak or evil\\, or as in Han and Luke's case\\, kill them off. I hope over time that revenue from merchandising\\, and future films\\, destroys Disney for what you have done to such a treasured franchise. The plot is non-existent\\, the jokes are poor\\, the new characters introduced were hollow and part of the new age agenda we have to have rammed down our throats every day. This is NOT Star Wars! You should be ashamed Rian and Disney. Why? Why? Why?","true":true}
