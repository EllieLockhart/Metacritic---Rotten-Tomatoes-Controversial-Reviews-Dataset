Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Might not be the best of the franchise but SW:TLJ definitely a damn good Star Wars movie. It doesn't hesitate to take the lore\/saga to a new route. It also showcased one of the best Luke and Leia moments and how bad-ass the Skywalkers are. In the end\\, SW8 never disappoints me and brings a new flavor to the saga.","true":true}
