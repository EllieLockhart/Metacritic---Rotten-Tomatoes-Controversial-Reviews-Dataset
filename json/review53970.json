Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am aware that many will disagree with me on this\\, and I understand why\\, but I absolutely love The Last Jedi for many of the same reasons I expect some will hate it\\, it is unquestionably a Star Wars film while at the same time being a very different animal when compared to everything that has come before it. the treatment of the mysteries put forth in the last one made the universe feel so much bigger to me\\, and while The Force Awakens played it mostly safe\\, The Last Jedi does everything but. \\n\\nthe cast all bring their A-game\\, Mark Hamill is great every time he's on-screen as is the late Carrie Fisher\\, who gets a much bigger part than I was expecting. Daisy Ridley\\, John Boyega and Oscar Issac are fast cementing themselves as the new \\\"big three\\\" of the Star Wars universe and Adam Driver\\, who I wasn't sure about last time\\, really comes into his own\\, I am fully on-board with Kylo Ren as a character now.\\n\\nThe story is what I will expect will divide most people\\, as mentioned\\, in stark contrast to The Force Awakens and its somewhat fan-filmy\\, safe attitude\\, there are risks aplenty taken here. but for now suffice it to say\\, that the part you hated? Yeah I fucking loved that bit (probably.) \\n\\nThe soundtrack is still great and familiar\\, although it felt a little underused in places. and the sheer amount of story packed into this film was easily enough for at least one of those two-part finales that studios seem so keen on doing these days\\, the criticisms I do have are that because of this\\, some characters are a little underutilized and feel like they get lost in the shuffle. But it all culminates in one of the best climaxes in the franchise and an epilogue that leaves me very excited for Episode IX and also for Rian Johnson's upcoming trilogy.\\n\\nSpeaking of...is it too late to get Rian Johnson to direct Episode IX? No disrespect to JJ Abrams but I just don't see him living up to this. \\nactually y'know what? I will do a ranking list for Star Wars\\, after all\\, I was gonna talk spoilers after this review\\, but I'll do it there instead.\\n\\nIn Summary The Last Jedi is a familiar\\, yet refreshingly different take on the universe\\, I love it for the same reasons some of you will hate it\\, and I think you should definitely see this one without being spoiled if you can.","true":true}
