Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"All I care here is the story. The first game gave us an amazing story and experience\\, where you are part of the bonding process of Ellie and Joel. You learn how to love both of the characters\\, and the Left Behind adds to that. TLOU2? It's ridiculous compared to the first one. Joel's character was severely brain damaged by the writers to do what he does. The story unfolds with a promise of something you never achieve\\, nor Ellie. Not to mention the trailer where Joel first appears was nothing but a big fat lie\\, misleading us to the bad written plot Naugthy Dog had come up. I don't feel like I wasted money buying this game\\, instead I like to think I bought a little bit of wisdom in not falling for hype and critics pre-analysis or critics analysis at all. That's my first and I hope\\, only\\, review. I'm heartbroken with this game. If Naughty Dog still has one functional neuron on their collective mind\\, they would rearrange the game\\, placing it chronologically. The flash backs between Ellie and Joel would happen first\\, and then we would be dragged to the \\\"present\\\" it wouldn't fix the poorly written story\\, but it would give a decent pace to the narrative and it would show a small appreciation and respect for the fans of the first installment of the franchise. 1\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
