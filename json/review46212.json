{"101487":193222,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning - Contains Spoilers!!\\n\\nBefore I watched this film I was aware of a disturbance in the force. Critics loved the film\\, but some fans were showing their displeasure. I had no idea why\\, so I went in feeling a bit nervous\\, wondering what I was about to experience.\\n\\nThe last thing I expected to happen in the opening scene was that I'd laugh. But when Poe stalled for time and made General Hux look like the incompetent fool he is; I was taken nicely by surprise. The opening battle was intense\\, loved it\\, what a ride!\\n\\nI did wonder how the First Order had managed to recover from the loss of their Starkiller base so quickly but then I realised they did the same in Empire after the Death Star was destroyed. I also realised that the First Order had wiped out the entire Republic before their base was destroyed and was now throwing everything they had to finish off the resistance. It could be what we are witnessing is the last of the First Order's resources\\, they just have substantially more than the resistance at this point. If they wipe the resistance out\\, there literally is no-one left in the galaxy to stand in their way. This gives the whole move a dark\\, desperate edge.\\n\\nWe then switched to 'Jedi Island'. I'd been dreading this part. I expected Luke had turned into an Obi-Wan-Kanobi role and we'd be in for quite a dreary series of training scenes. When he tossed aside the light sabre\\, I laughed unexpectedly again.\\n\\nAt this point\\, I think I decided I loved what was going on\\, sat back and enjoyed the ride. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was being so unpredictable. I think that mental acceptance helped all the pieces of the movie fall into place. From the reviews and comments I've read\\, if you don't buy into it\\, the opposite seems to happen.  This was quite a risky approach from Johnson and I do applaud such a bold decision.\\n\\nWe soon learn that Luke has turned into a bitter old man\\, full of anger and resentment at his perceived failures. His believes his moment of weakness created Kylo Ren\\, but Ben was already lost. Luke can't see this.  He's not only isolated himself from the rest of the galaxy\\, but from the force itself. His concept of the Jedi is that they were a flawed concept. After watching the prequels\\, this was a conclusion I came to a long time ago\\, it was nice to hear this echoed. There should not be an elite select few chosen as guardians of the galaxy\\, there's no balance in such a concept. The fact that one Sith took down the entire Jedi proves this. The force should be there for everyone.  That's the balance. The Last Jedi rips up this overworked Chosen One narrative and the notion that the Force should belong to only a certain elite sect.\\n\\n\\nMark Hamill was initially dead set against the script. I follow him on twitter and he even said he disagreed with every single aspect of Luke but did the job anyway. However since then he's said\\, \\\"It took me a while to get around to his way of thinking. But once I was there\\, it was a thrilling experience.\\\" I think some fans will eventually get to that point as well once the shock wears off.\\n\\n\\nAnd the dark side. I loved how the dark side tempted Rey\\, promising her answers to her parent's identity. But in the end\\, it simply showed her reflection. The dark side promises answers but it's all a lie. The dark sides isolates you until all you have left is yourself; which it then consumes.\\n\\n\\nBack with the resistance\\, we basically have one long desperate race followed by one desperate last stand.  Every small victory comes with a bitter price and not every daring plan works. This really raised the stakes.What heightened the tension here for me was the desperate plans kept on failing. Finn's unauthorised mission to retrieve the codebreaker\\, while noble and courageous\\, failed spectacularly. The Vice-Admiral's plan to sneak the transports to the base failed. The attempt to take out the Death Star cannon failed. Each failure cost lives. Each loss reduced the dwindling hope that the resistance would survive at all. We started off with hundreds of resistance personal\\, by the end there was about twenty.\\n\\n\\nAnd then Luke performed that amazing Force Projection bluff. That totally fooled me\\, even though I should have guessed it from his new appearance. In Luke's final act\\, not only did he save the last remanence of the resistance\\, but in single-handily standing up to the armed might of the New Order and making Kylo Ren look like a fool\\, he reignited the Skywalker legend to a whole new generation of people throughout the galaxy. He's inspired those gifted with force powers and no doubt his sacrifice will result in many more recruits for the resistance.\\n \\n\\nThe showdown between Ben\\, Rey and Snoke also was unexpected. If Snoke had turned out to be the Emperor's clone\\, or Luke's Dark side\\, or any other predictable fan theories that's been banded around for the past year\\, it would have been disappointing. Similarly\\, if Rey was Ben's sister then we'd now be discussing how much of an Empire clone we just watched.\\n\\n\\nSure\\, these types of reveals are classic Star Wars\\, but yet again we would have found that important characters are all conveniently connected yet  are totally unaware of it. Instead\\, Snoke is just another Sith vying for power. I love how we've gone from the Empire with powerful figures like Palpatine\\, Vader and Tarkin\\, to less competent people who've taken advantage of a legacy and are desperately scrambling to maintain their position. Snoke is no Emperor and Kylo Ren really is a poor man's Vader;  Snoke even admitted as such. He's been using him. Ben is trying so desperately to be Vader but he's a terrified little boy and yet he is growing and learning. He fooled Snoke. He thinks if he can kill the past he can define his own future. He's not redeemable\\, as Rey discovered. If this had been just a re-hash of the Luke\/Vader confrontation in ROTJ I would have been disappointed. Ben now has the potential to grow into something far more dangerous than Vader ever was.\\n\\n\\nAnd Rey is a nobody\\, her parents just junkers who sold her for a quick fix! I really like that. It feels far more natural than her being the long lost granddaughter of Obi-Wan or something.\\n\\n\\nJohnson wasn't following a trilogy arc or a story arc at all\\, he had free reign. Yes\\, what he's done is kill the past in effect and severed ties with the classic star wars. In doing so he's left it wide open for a new one. I for one applaud that plus the way he did it. I think The Force Awakens didn't really do anyone any favours. We all complained about it being a New Hope Reboot but middle-aged fans loved the nostalgia of being an 8 year old all over again. Everyone was expecting a similar Empire reboot. While it did tread some similar ground of Empire and RoTJ\\, it flipped all expectations and did something new. I think it is remarkable. It was such a swan song for Carrie Fisher\\, all her scenes were so powerful. I went cold all over when she used the force\\, the first time we've ever seen her do so on-screen.\\n\\n\\nI have no idea what will happen next\\, no-one does. Rather than us all expecting a RoTJ remake next\\, the Star Wars universe is open for new stories\\, new adventure and new characters.\\n\\nBTW - I don't think the movie was perfect by far. It felt too long\\, I think they could cut 20 mins easy. I was disappointed that Ackbar was killed off-screen. I felt he should have been the one to do the light speed manoeuvre. I think too much effort and focus was made on Rose. She seemed likable enough but didn't quite work for me. For so much effort\\, I didn't feel anything at all when she sacrificed herself or that her love for Finn was real. Del Torro's character was also way off. He was underused and just weird. I really did like the fact that he raised the aspect of the blur between good and evil. Some folks are not evil\\, they are just doing business\\, or they switch allegiances simply to survive. I did like that point he made but it felt forced\\, as was his character.\\n\\nHowever\\, overall I thought it was awesome.","true":true}
