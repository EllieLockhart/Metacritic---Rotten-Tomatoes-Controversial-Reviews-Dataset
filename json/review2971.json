Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad dialogue\\, forced jokes and pointless plot lines combine to make this a very disappointing film that throws away all build up from the Force Awakens and doesn\u2019t bother having any build up of it\u2019s own. It feels like the movie tries to provide quantity over quality for just about every aspect of the film. Visuals were ok but not enough to sway my disappointment. ","true":true}
