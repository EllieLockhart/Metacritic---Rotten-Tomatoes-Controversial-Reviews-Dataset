Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move suked and was complete troll of movie fans in general and star Wars fans in particular. The social justice warriors have now infected Star wars. The ironic thing is as a man\\, I was fine with a female lead character\\, from the last movie\\, but they even ruined that\\, she's just a Mary Sue now. Let's not even talk about what they did to the Luke Character\\, his legacy was trashed\\, on purpose. That's just the beginning of why I say the whole thing is a troll. Some good cinematography\\, but story suked.","true":true}
