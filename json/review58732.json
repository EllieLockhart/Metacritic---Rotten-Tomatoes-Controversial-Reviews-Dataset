Another strange thing is that the creators decided to significantly limit the number of black opponents\\, rly? the creators assumed that during such an apocalypse there are definitely more white people than black people?! pathological... and this is exactly political correctness....When it comes to the AI \u200b\u200b(people) often is wrong\/bugs\\, when it comes to zombies it is just like in the first part\\, nothing new\\, only a new interface\\, if the opponent notices us constantly we receive notifications that we have been detected and we are threatened\\, it is really annoying and you can't turn it off.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
