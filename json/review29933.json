Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined 30 years of story\\, and made Luke a loser old hermit for the sake of making the legacy of the jedi a story for the new characters.  I gladly signed the petition to remove this one more story from canon.","true":true}
