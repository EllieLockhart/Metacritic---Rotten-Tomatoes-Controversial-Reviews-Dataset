Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually breathtaking scenes\\, uneven tones\\, offkey humour\\, all the character set ups since Force Awakens have been dismantled into one-dimensional figures. Such immense scope but little depth. Such a shame as there's only one more film left to sort out Rian Johnsons mess.","true":true}
