Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will be one of the most divisive movies in the entire franchise to date. The first movie in the new trilogy was criticised for its lack of change. Now people argue that The Last Jedi wasn't enough like Star Wars. I have never been a hardcore fan of star wars but I have seen all of the movies and consider myself a fan. \\n\\nStar Wars is changing whether people like it or not. It is just like the band that you used to love but now dislike because they \\\"changed\\\" in the last album. With such a large audience people will never agree on what makes a \\\"good\\\" Star Wars movie. Often the loudest voices are those that are angry or disappointed. \\n\\nFrom my point of view the movie was good. It was extremely long and that was what some people complained about (really?). If you get bored super easily then dont watch this movie. Personally\\, I thought there was a very good mix of storytelling and action that kept me engaged. \\n\\nFurthermore\\, the franchise is moving in a new direction. The evidence is right in the title The \\\"Last\\\" Jedi. Some people will like it and others won't.","true":true}
