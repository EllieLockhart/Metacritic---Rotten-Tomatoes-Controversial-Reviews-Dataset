Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe this film has made it one of the most diverse\\, most diffrent\\, and most daring changed in Star Wars history. But man in my openion did I love it\\, and it's understood from both sides of the reviews that it has its fair share of problems from many peoples eyes. But being a Star Wars finatic! It's hard to not love it. But not only that\\, but it accels in what it was meant to do... be different\\, it was never supposed to be similar and play it safe\\, if it was it would be more Luke warm rather than diverse! And man did I love it! Go check it out if you havent and you'll be supprised on eiether ways!","true":true}
