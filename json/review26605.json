Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay I get it\\, woman can be strong\\, men can be wrong\\, and you took a philosophy class your freshman year of college. Now\\, can I please have my Star Wars back. I'm not asking for much\\, just an interesting well developed lead character\\, a thought-out story\\, and at least one epic lightsaber battle. Really\\, you don't need to use Star Wars to push your views anymore.","true":true}
