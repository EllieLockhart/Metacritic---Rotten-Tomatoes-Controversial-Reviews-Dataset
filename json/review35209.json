Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force was not strong with this one. Star Wars: The Last Jedi gets a 4.2\/10 from The Cinema-Fan. As a fan of every Star Wars movie since A New Hope\\, this was a surprisingly big letdown. The visuals are absolutely fantastic\\, the cinematography is dope\\, and the acting by Adam Driver is great. However\\, The Last Jedi is a film that makes more sense the less you think about it.\\n\\n If you look at TLJ as a whole\\, you will see unnecessary plot twists\\, a severe lack of character development\\, weird dialogue\\, bad humor\\, an absence of depth\\, and completely pointless subplots. Very little is accomplished in the entire 2+ hours of the film. Almost everything before the concluding 25-30 minutes is inconsequential and ends up not mattering in the slightest. \\n\\nTLJ feels completely out of sync with The Force Awakens and this trilogy is beginning to feel like a battle between two directors who have 2 completely different visions. I don't necessarily view TLJ as a bad Star Wars movie as much as I view it as a bad movie in general.","true":true}
