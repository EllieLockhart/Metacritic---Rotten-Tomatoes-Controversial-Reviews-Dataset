Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was fantastic gameplay wise. I played and completed it in the first week of release so of course there was 1 or 2 glitches\\, but for a game this huge that is to be expected. The gameplay was perfect\\, they took everything from part 1 and just improved upon it. I just wanted the game to last forever because the gameplay was that satisfying (especially if you enjoy gore). TheThis game was fantastic gameplay wise. I played and completed it in the first week of release so of course there was 1 or 2 glitches\\, but for a game this huge that is to be expected. The gameplay was perfect\\, they took everything from part 1 and just improved upon it. I just wanted the game to last forever because the gameplay was that satisfying (especially if you enjoy gore). The story... It's rare for a game to make you feel something... But just like the first game\\, this story makes you feel a lot of things\\, and due to the alternate perspective element of this story you end up feeling even more. I will be playing this game again soon.(Why only 9\/10?) I feel that the story could have given me more in terms of answers. Anyone who has played the first game will know about Ellie's arm\\, this was mentioned\/referenced maybe 3 times throughout. This story is not about a cure at all\\, this story is about living in this new world and deciding what you want to fight for and when you decide to fight for it or let it go. But this story never really climaxed\\, rather it just kept building up to not much and then hanging back a bit before building up again and then taking its foot off the gas. Don't get me wrong\\, there were a lot of emotional scenes\\, but despite the fact it is made like a fantastic film\\, this is still a game and we do need a story which gives us satisfaction through that gameplay (I.e pulling the trigger that finally kills the protagonist\\, or making the final decision to do the thing you were trying to do the whole game\\, or even choosing to walk away). Most of the important moments were just a cutscene\\, then we went back to the same (fantastic) gameplay.I would not want anything from the story to be removed\\, rather I'd want some of that story to be gameplay rather than a cut scene and some additional character development\/backstory added for the unanswered questions.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
