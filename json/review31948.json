Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER!!! One of the worst Star Wars movies! Very Disney like jokes throughout the film\\, the made Luke look like dumb dad from a Nickelodeon tv show. The questions people have been asking for the past two years got an answer in the way of rays parents don\u2019t matter cause they were just som drunks and Snoke\\, even though he is the strongest character we have made and has the most mystery behind his character\\, let\u2019s not tell anyone who he is or where he came from and let\u2019s just kill him off. I\u2019m so disappointed! I love Star Wars so much but this movie almost ruined the whole Star Wars universe for me.","true":true}
