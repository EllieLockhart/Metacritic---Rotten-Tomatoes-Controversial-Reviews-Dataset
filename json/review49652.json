Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow to think people say Bobba fett died like a punk in Return of the Jedi\\, this is even worse. Dont listen to Disney and this movie message kids\\, blowing yourselves for any cause is not heroic or cool in any way","true":true}
