Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(SPOILERS AHEAD) I realize many people do not enjoy this film\\, many times because of Luke's character development. However that was what I liked most about the movie. Luke was old and had lost hope because guess what? It's not his story anymore and those complaining that they feel \\\"it's not your Star Wars and Disney isn't listening to life long fans\\\"? You're right. Because it's NOT just your Star Wars. Disney is bringing in New people. My girlfriend has NEVER liked Star wars but this movie is one that she LOVES. She's seen it 3 times already and as a lifetime Star Wars fan\\, it fills my heart with joy\\, seeing her have the same reaction I had to previous movies. \\nThe new Star wars movies are no longer just for life long fans and I love that. \\nFurthermore\\, Luke as a grumpy\\, tired old man who just feels done\\, I don't blame him and I'M in the same boat. It was relatable. \\nAnd Yes\\, your perfect Luke made a mistake and wanted to kill Ben. But he was scared. He realized his mistake\\, but even great heroes are allowed to make mistakes. But if you had lost everything and the thing you had fought hardest to protect (Jedi Order) and the hardest to destroy (Empire) had been destroyed and was now again in full power\\, I would be depressed\\, suicidal\\, and frankly done.\\n\\nI actually felt the worst thing in the movie was Admiral Holdo not telling Poe the plan. Yes he had been dropped down to a Captain\\, but if you don't tell a hot headed crewman (who is essentially a Commander\\, like come on) who has loads of influence on the crew\\, then you can't blame him for what he did. \\nI thought Rose was cute and The Casino planet was important for the further characterization of Finn. It wasn't amazing but I enjoyed it.\\n\\nOverall\\, i absolutely loved the movie. It felt more like a Star wars movie and was original\\, funny\\, stayed true to the characters\\, and while I would have loved some more Finn and Poe interaction\\, I feel this ranks quite high in the franchise\\, at least for me.","true":true}
