Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most disappointed with Luke's portrayal. 40 years since Luke's return to the big screen and it's unfortunate how dismal and crotchety the character has been turned into in The Last Jedi... The new series lacks continuity with the previous Star Wars movies. If you're hoping for a Star Wars that builds upon what was already previously built\\, \\\"this isn't the [movie] you're looking for.\\\"","true":true}
