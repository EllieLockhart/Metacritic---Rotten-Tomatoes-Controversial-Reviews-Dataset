I would rather have burned myself with a fire made of 60 dollars than have bought this game.\r\rThis game deserves and has earned every bit of hate and every bad review. People call it review bombing because they desperately need to have a \\\"progressive\\\" game to look at and feel represented by. Make something good and if it happens to have gay characters and such then great\\, you know like the first game. Just another case of politics and thirst for lib-clout ruining something else.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
