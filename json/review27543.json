Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall one of my favorite movies but all of the metaphors make the story a bit hard to follow for the average viewer. That CGI Yoda was pretty cool though. The way that Luke dies is a bit stupid though. I feel like if he was chopped in half by Kylo Ren\\, it would have been a more emotional\\, tear raising moments in Star Wars history. Again\\, one of my favorite movies\\, has it's flaws.","true":true}
