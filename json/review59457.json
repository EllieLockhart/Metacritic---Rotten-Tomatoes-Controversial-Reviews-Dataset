Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Outstanding game. First off\\, ignore the fake reviews on here\\, theres a lot. You can tell as the date on them is the same day the game released. The game took me just under a week to finish (29hrs) then I went back for the platinum (extra 20 hrs). Had an amazing time with this game. The graphics and gameplay are phenomenal.

If you aren't fan of one or the other\\, you can literally skip it one way or another. For example\\, most of the combat encounters can be skipped by stealthily crossing and escaping through a door. Should you go guns blazing\\,  it can get very brutal\\, some of the most over the top but realistic gore I have ever seen in a game. People are bashing this game because of the story not living up to their expectations\\,  I new the leaks but never watched any clips.  I was a little shocked at the direction\\, but not as upset as some fans of the original. I still went and pre ordered and was not disappointed. I didnt find the story or writing bad\\, maybe the way certain things played out could have been different\\,  but they are what they are and I can live with that. If you're open minded about the story telling\\,  you'll really enjoy this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
