{"101487":138739,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I realise I am bit late to the party\\, but I feel the need to have my say on this movie. I watched this just after its release\\, and have pondered on it for a while before deciding to write my feelings down. I have never written a review on here before. I will try to minimise spoilers.\\n\\n \\n\\nFirst things first\\, I am a 41 yr. old Star Wars fan. I was at the right age when the original trilogy was current and had the toys every Christmas for years. I have seen every episode at the flicks\\, catching the original trilogy when the special editions were released; in fact Empire was the first movie we ever rented when we had our first VHS back in the 80's. I have enjoyed them immensely\\, having formed the majority of my early childhood. I even liked the unfairly hated prequels for the most part. The point being I was genuinely excited to watch this movie\\, and I wanted to enjoy it. I gain nothing from a Star Wars movie being poor.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHowever\\, this love of the franchise must not affect our ability to judge this movie objectively and on its own merit. To be fair to these newer films\\, the original trilogy has been raised to an almost mythical status to which all new films are judged\\, which isn't really fair. We must bear this in mind\\, as for some fans no new Star Wars movies will ever be better than the originals no matter how good they are. However on the flip side just because it says Star Wars on the ticket stub\\, it doesn't make it a masterpiece by default.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMuch has been said of Disney's effect on the franchise\\, good or bad. We can probably expect a Star Wars movie every year until it is no longer profitable to do so\\, much the same as the Marvel MCU. Whether this causes any long term damage to the legacy of the franchise will be irrelevant to Disney if there is profit to be made. Focus has also been drawn to Disney's unnecessary social justice and feminist agenda's displayed in the movie\\, and an argument can be made for this. Whether or not these issues ruin your enjoyment of the film is a personal choice.\\n\\n \\n\\nHowever for my part\\, the real issues with this movie centre on problems all good movies must avoid\\, irrespective of the franchise. Poor plot and pacing\\, poor character development\\, poor continuity\\, inappropriate tone and perhaps most importantly for older fans\\, poor treatment of legacy characters. To delve too deeply into these issues would take to long for my intended purpose. Many excellent analyses have already been done elsewhere\\, and I would urge you to seek these out if you are so inclined and haven't already.\\n\\nTo be direct\\, the plot is terrible. To make matters worse there are gaping plot holes\\, they are obvious and some contradict already established rules of the franchise. This negatively affects continuity\\, as well as character motivations and actions in previous episodes. One good example would be the weaponization of Hyperspace. One would be correct in thinking that if this were possible\\, why has no one tried it in any previous episode. This could have worked on the Death Stars\\, which in turn would have made Rogue One pointless. Come to think of it\\, it makes the Deathstars pointless. Furthermore\\, this will now need to happen in every major space battle going forward or it will require an explanation as to why it is not.\\n\\nCharacters have little development\\, do stupid things without reason and are discarded without a moment's notice. Sub plots are inserted for no reason or purpose other than giving pointless characters something to do. Plot twists seem forced\\, there to pull the rug from under us seemingly only to defy fans theories and expectations.\\n\\nThe continuity is also a major problem when you realise the events in this movie seemingly take place only days after the last movie. There is no decent explanation for any questions raised in The Force Awakens. No explanation for The First Order's sudden rise to power despite the Empire being defeated in The Return of the Jedi. Nothing on the New Republic and the society that was built following the fall of the Empire. Nothing on The Knights of Ren\\, Snoke\\, Luke's academy\\, Rey's power... Just for the record\\, I was genuinely happy to see a female protagonist and found Rey to be a likable character in The Force Awakens. However\\, the uproar from the feminist fraternity that fans were criticising her as a 'Mary Sue' never stemmed from Rey being female\\, simply that her power and abilities have not been earned as a character. This is what the term 'Mary Sue' means. That no satisfactory explanation is for this power is provided in this movie compounds the problem further.\\n\\n \\n\\nI feel the real reason this film has angered a large portion of the fan base\\, other than being a genuinely poor movie is the characterisation issues\\, particularly with Luke. What Disney has seemingly failed to realise is to the extent the original fans hold these characters dear to their hearts. It's these fans who kept this franchise relevant\\, writing novels and such for the 'extended universe' during the lean years between the trilogies. When Disney bought Lucasfilm and ruled anything not movie as 'non-cannon' this understandably riled a lot of fans up. To be fair to Disney\\, this made some sense. Disney needed a cleaner\\, more uncluttered slate to make movies going forward. Not everybody has read a lot of this work\\, and to try to keep on top this is quite an undertaking. Disney wanted to tell its own story. However the fans needed something in return and they didn't get it. What they got was a total disregard for the mythology of the franchise and a character assassination of its most important asset.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAs of the time of writing\\, the Rotten Tomatoes score is sitting at a 91% critical score compared to a 49% viewer rating. Clearly many of the professional critics got something very wrong. I doubt anyone was bribed but some were certainly spooked\\, afraid to publically criticise such a large studio. Some were possible afraid to alienate themselves with a huge fan base\\, assuming that the fans would love the movie regardless. Or maybe\\, some were swept away with being treated like royalty at the lavish premieres.\\n\\nSome on the other hand may genuinely have enjoyed it\\, but I have seen far better movies than this ruthlessly dissected by the same 'professional' critics that I find it hard to see why they hold it in such high regard. This is certainly not the one of the best in the franchise\\, and it may well be the worst. That we are now seeing articles from various websites and  critics almost daily on how we have misunderstood The Last Jedi\\, desperate to convince us that we should enjoy it\\, makes me think they know we have rumbled them.\\n\\nIt's also no use explaining that plot holes are to be tied up in video games\\, graphic novels or other third party media. Although these can certainly flesh stories out\\, they must not be used to plug holes in a poor movie. Many people will only watch the movies; therefore the core story arc and rules must be coherent and consistent across this platform first and foremost. The newly expanded Jedi powers are a good example. When challenged on why new characters portray powers superior to older characters in previous movies\\, writer \/ director Rian Johnson indicated on Twitter he had found these new abilities in a Star Wars book. However the problem is there is no precedent in the movies for these abilities\\, and again as many wouldn't have read these books it seems jarring when seen in this movie.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThere seems nowhere to take this trilogy now\\, and such is the direction these new movies are taking I have no desire to see episode 9\\, or for that matter any further Disney additions. Maybe Star Wars isn't for my generation anymore. Trends such as music and movies change over time\\, and it's not unusual for people to cling to what they enjoyed when they were younger. The people who seem to like The Last Jedi the most seem to be the younger audience which I suspect was always Disney's intention. Some of these people and critics believe this is how it should be\\, passing the mantle from the old to the new. There are ways to do this however\\, and if in the future the Harry Potter franchise is rejuvenated with movies that depict Harry as a bitter old hermit who abandons his friends at the first sign of trouble\\, then you will feel our pain.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen all is said and done\\, I'm not here to tell you what to enjoy. This is therapy of sorts to vent my frustrations. I left the cinema empty and feeling worried for the future of my most treasured of franchises. Say what you will of the prequels\\, but they told a good story. They expanded on the mythology already established and made the Star Wars universe huge. Yes the script was a little clunky and some of the acting was a little poor\\, but the originals weren't perfect. They also had many more memorable scenes than we have seen thus far in this new trilogy. Taken as a whole\\, watching the first six episodes tells a much more satisfactory story with a proper conclusion.\\n\\n \\n\\nNo further story is required...","true":true}
