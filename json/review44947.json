Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh\\, saw it today\\, the whole storyline for Rey is laughable. When Luke was young\\, he was trained by Kenobi and Yoda\\, and then had months of self-training -- yet still lost a hand to Vader. Throughout the movie\\, Rey is never trained by anyone. No training. No effort. No rigor. Zero. Zilch. And yet Rey can somehow defeat Luke Freaking Skywalker when they're sparring. And then she goes on to defeat three Emperor's Guard in combat. It reeks of immaturity & entitlement.","true":true}
