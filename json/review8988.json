{"101487":122099,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-14","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the moment the title of the latest installment of the on-going Star Wars saga was finally announced\\, 11 months before the films release\\, it was clear something wasn't right.  The Last Jedi  - I liked it.  It had an air of finality about it that confused me\\, but the title itself wasn't the problem.  The beloved Star Wars logo - the lettering that had accompanied every Star Wars film since the beginning way back in '77 had always been yellow.  Not so here.  Too much of a departure to have been an arbitrary decision\\, this was the first clue that Episode VIII was going to dare to be its own thing.  And in the months that followed the advertising campaign would push this new aesthetic further\\, emphasising a deep royal red against the more familiar juxtaposition of black and white - light and dark.  It is fair to say that The Last Jedi has a unique visual identity - and it looks glorious.\\n\\nThough stunning to look at\\, this bold colour palette is not the most striking thing about this film.  Though many have complained about the apparent lack of any coherent plot\\, the narrative arc in The Last Jedi is all about character - and everything that transpires is about developing this element.  Every one of the key players must undergo some kind of transformation to understand themselves or the world around them - and to a greater or lesser extent\\, every one of them is changed come the final act.\\n\\nWith Finn (John Boyega)\\, it's about realising that war is not as black and white as it appears\\, and that in a more ambiguous reality it shouldn't be about \\\"Fighting what we hate\\\" but \\\"saving what we love\\\" \\n\\nWith Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) it's about realising he can't solve all his problems by \\\"jumping in an X-wing and blowing stuff up\\\" - That he has to learn to think more laterally if he is to become someone people will follow.  Emphasised neatly with one of Leia's closing lines \\\"what are you looking at me for?  Follow him.\\\"\\nFor Leia herself (Carrie Fisher)\\, it's about saying goodbye.  To Han (her decision to leave the dice from the Falcon in the abandoned Resistance base)\\, to any hope that her son might return\\, and lastly\\, to her brother\\, Luke.\\n\\nThough the plight of each of the major characters is more complicated\\, one thing all their journeys share in common is a sense that they need to evolve - to specifically not cling to the past - to let it go and to move forward.\\n\\nAfter 2015s The Force Awakens\\, one of the things some fans were frantically speculating about was who Rey's (Daisy Ridley) parents were - like it would have made some colossal difference to the story moving forwards.  It would have felt contrived and unnecessary\\, but it would also have harmed one of the most important implications of The Last Jedi\\, something writer\/director Rian Johnson\\, his heart worn plainly on his sleeve\\, was keen to make clear:  We are not defined by our past - our future is the sum of the decisions we make\\, and the actions we choose\\, in the present.  You don't need to come from strength to be strong.  \\nFrom the film's most surreal scene (no too unlike the cave scene on Degobah from The Empire Strikes Back) where Rey confronts a darkened mirror only to discover an infinite number of herself reflected back at her\\, to the announcement by Kylo Ren that \\\"your parents were no-bodies\\\" - Johnson is simply asking you to believe\\, not necessarily in his film\\, but in yourself and your own capabilities.\\n\\nOf all the characters in The Last Jedi Kylo Ren (played by the always impressive Adam Driver) is the most conflicted.  Unlike Rey\\, who is seeking a past she thinks she needs\\, he seeks to destroy his and any attachment he has to it\\, afraid that he will never reach his aspirations otherwise.  One of the things that has always struck me about Star Wars is that the Rebels\\, though united by their common cause\\, are also friends.  The Imperials on the other hand\\, and now The First Order\\, also united by their cause\\, are alone; and no-one is more so than Kylo Ren.  Estranged from Mother\\, Father and Mentor - abandoned by them all in a sense\\, it is little wonder that he is so lost.  Felt most keenly when he holds out his hand to Rey\\, after what was one the entire franchises most standout moments where he and Rey face Snoke's guards together\\, and says simply \\\"Please.\\\"  \\n\\nHis arc closes with every opportunity around him for redemption fading away\\, symbolised by his Father's dice\\, that his Mother left in the abandoned base\\, disappearing before his eyes - just as his old mentor had moments before\\, and just as Rey does moments later\\, as they look at each other through The Force for the last time.\\n\\nSo what has become of Luke Skywalker (a career best Mark Hamill)?  Jedi Knight - hero of the Rebellion against the Empire - Legend.  This is one of the aspects of the film that has polarised its audience the most.  He is broken - consumed by failure - bitter and lost.  I wanted a Luke Skywalker that still had something to aspire to\\, something more than simply the passing of a torch.  He is honest concerning the history of his religion and its multiple failings\\, the dangers of hubris\\, in particularly his own.   His ruminations on The Force\\, though damning of the Jedi assumption of ownership\\, are in keeping with Johnson's message of self-belief\\, and frankly\\, help to restore some of the magic surrounding it before the prequels ditched the child-like pseudo philosophy in favour of unnecessarily technical and physical explanations.  \\nThough some may struggle with the idea that Luke would have resigned himself internally to his despair\\, it makes for a new lesson to be learned for the ageing Jedi - and in heeding the words of his former master\\, he becomes the embodiment of the franchise itself\\, accepting his failures\\, embracing them even\\, before paving the way to what is now an unpredictable and unknown future.  \\n\\nEveryone in The Last Jedi has to let go of something in order to move forward\\, but the hardest task by far\\, is ours.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStandout moments for me were the killing of Snoke (it wasn't his story and It's great that he hasn't followed the same path as his original trilogy counterpart\\, The Emperor.  I also never felt the need to have who he was explained to me) - The rendition of the Force theme heard here as Rey catches Luke's ignited blue lightsaber\\, and stands with Kylo Ren to face Snoke's guards\\, before a flawlessly choreographed scene of genuine menace\\,  was the highlight of the entire film for me.\\n\\nAnother moment that makes great use of the colour scheme is where Ren raises his arms\\, lightsaber in hand\\, ready to strike down his former mentor\\, only for the camera to cut to his feet\\, as his black boots slice through the salty surface of the planet Crait\\, to reveal a dusty red streak of the planets mineral in his wake as he skids past him - gore without any gore.\\n\\nThe most tender moment is Luke's apology and goodbye to his sister.  Two characters that haven't appeared together on screen since 1983s Return of the Jedi accompanied by a theme that hasn't been heard since the moment Luke first revealed their connection to each other.  It's made all the more poignant by the fact it feels like witnessing Mark Hamill's real life goodbye to his life-long friend and co-star\\, the late Carrie Fisher.\\n\\nThe John Williams score warrants a review all of its own.  There are some wonderful evocations of characters long gone with the use of their leitmotivs from earlier films.  Rey's theme\\, once timid and unassuming (at least until the moment she cuts down Kylo Ren at the end of The Force Awakens) is bold and assertive throughout here.  The same can be said for Rose's theme (one of the new characters\\, played by Kelly Marie Tran) in a film that in general celebrates very strong female lead characters throughout.  \\\"The March of the Resistance\\\"\\, one of the standout themes of The Force Awakens is back in all its glory here.  And there is a fantastic re-orchestration of a piece originally heard in Star Wars (I still can't bring myself to call it A New Hope - those of a certain age will understand why) first heard as the Millennium Falcon is under attack from a small band of Tie-fighters upon escaping the Death Star with Princess Leia.  Heard here towards the end of the film as the Falcon flies though the crevices and under the surface of Crait\\, again pursued by Tie-fighters.  There are so many other noteworthy aspects of the score.  I desperately hope John Williams is able to return for Episode IX.\\n\\nI didn't think it was a perfect film.  I loved the practical aesthetic established by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens and grew a little tired of some of the excessive use of CGI in The Last Jedi (especially the look of Canto Bight).  The world of TLJ in general didn't feel as organic or as open to me as TFA\\, and the humour didn't feel as natural either.  Though\\, having recently re-watched TFA it is fair to say they are very different beasts in more ways than one.\\n\\nA couple of moments did have me wondering if they were perhaps a little too on the nose\\, even for Star Wars.  Though with strong performances throughout\\, genuine surprises\\, and some fantastically iconic Star Wars moments (\\\"I want every gun we have to fire on that man\\\") Star Wars - The Last Jedi more than lived up to my own personal expectations.  \\n\\nEveryone out there has their own idea about how Star Wars is supposed to go - I'm just glad that Rian Johnson's vision is the one I got to see.  \\n\\nAnd if you were also confused about the air of finality surrounding the title all those months back\\, just remember Luke Skywalker\\, Jedi Knight - saviour of the Resistance - Legend - as he spoke his final words in the Star Wars universe.\\n\\n\\\"I will not be The Last Jedi\\\"","true":true}
