Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was okay.  It passed the time.  Luke Skywalkers portrayal was disappointing.  Daisy Ridley is nice to look at but Rai is kind of boring.  She's good at everything.  There's no suspense when you see her.  You know she will defeat anything.  Kylo Ren is no Darth Vader.  Snoke was worthless.  Hux was stupid.  Holdo and Rose were terrible.  Poe besides his stupid joke in the beginning was the only good thing.  I like Fin too but this movie ruined him. ","true":true}
