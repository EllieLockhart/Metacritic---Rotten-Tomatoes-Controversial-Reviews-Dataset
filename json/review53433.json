Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney: Hey Rian\\, what's the plot for Episode VIII? \\n\\nRian: Aww man\\, super cool stuff. The First Order is going to chase the Resistance through space for 2 1\/2 hours while the Resistance ship slowly runs out of gas. And\\, Leia is going to float through space after her ship is destroyed. I'm also going to be extra lazy and make no attempt to address the visions Rey had in the Force Awakens. Also\\, the other sub plots will be boring and really useless. Oh and I think Luke will commit suicide or just vanish off a rock or something. \\n\\nDisney: Sounds good Rian\\, we'll just mash up the trailers to make it look good.","true":true}
