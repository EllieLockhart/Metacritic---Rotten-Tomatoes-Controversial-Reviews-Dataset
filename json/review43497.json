Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was basically a perfect Star Wars film.\\n\\nIt did things that no other film before it could do\\, specifically because you'd have to be in the position this film is in to do it within the overall stories timeline.  I won't go into detail\\, but this film sets the floor for every film to come in the future brilliantly and I can't wait to take the ride again <3","true":true}
