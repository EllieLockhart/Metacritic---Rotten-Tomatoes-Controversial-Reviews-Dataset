Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have played bad games before\\, but I've never played a game that left me so insulted and disgusted before.Like what most people have said\\, the graphics are beautiful\\, as is the sound design and the level layouts.But that can't save this game.The characters are unlikeable\\, not to mention any character from the previous games are GROSSLY out of character to shoehorn in certain plot points or lessons that make no sense in the first place.I never once felt any sympathy for Abby after she killed Joel.That death was not dignified in the slightest.If you are going to kill off one of the most beloved characters in all gaming\\, you damn well better do it right\\, and not only did they fail on every level to achieve that\\, they instead killed him in the most disgusting\\, out of character\\, despicable way I've ever seen in a game.As if that wasn't the end of it\\, they then FORCE YOU to play as his killer for almost half of the entirety of the game.These scenes are supposed to garner her sympathy to show her background.The ONLY reason I finished this game was to kill her\\, and in the end\\, the game doesn't even let you do that.tldr; They killed Joel in the worst way possible\\, in a way that made no sense for the character\\, had a character literally SPIT on his dead body\\, then force you to play as his killer\\, and in the end you don't even get to kill her.The makers of this game should be ashamed.R.i.p Joel\\, you deserved better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
