Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an AMAZING movie! Personally it was the best new Star Wars movie to come out. The reason for all the backlash is because the theories that the die hard Star Wars fans had were proven wrong but the way they were proven wrong gave a deeper meaning to the movie. You should defiantly see the movie if you are debating about it. You will not be let down.","true":true}
