Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really hard to explain my rating without spoilers\\, but here is my best attempt. I had really high expectations of this movie as a Star Wars fan\\, and when I found out critics were mostly giving it great reviews\\, those expectations became even higher. Unfortunately\\, Star Wars fans and viewers are more torn than Kylo Ren is between the dark and light side of the force. This movie did not hold up to my expectations as a Star Wars fan\\, but it was a very impressive film nonetheless. Some of the plotting was a little choppy and some scenes really dragged. I wasn't a fan of Rose and absolutely hated the side quest she and Finn went on (Don't worry\\, that's not much of a spoiler). And while the movie gave some great nostalgic nods toward the original trilogy\\, some of the things Star Wars fans thought they knew were completely changed. It's almost hard to accept some of what happens as Star Wars canon for how out-of character Luke behaves or certain revelations that turn the franchise on its head. It sounds like I'm giving a lot of negatives\\, but really the positives stand out more. Even though I can't give this movie a perfect score\\, it was damn awesome to watch. Some of these scenes were visually beautiful and dynamic with images that are extremely memorable and will surely give you goosebumps. And the music is flat-out epic\\, especially when it contains famous snippets of the original trilogy soundtrack. There are plenty of comedic moments that give the film a lighthearted touch (even though some of the humor seems a little off for the franchise). And finally\\, this film makes you reconsider and think about everything you thought you know about Star Wars. I don't think fans will hold this movie on a pedestal like the original trilogy\\, but I think it will be remembered (and easily more fondly than the prequel trilogy at least).","true":true}
