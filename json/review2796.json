Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie I guess the fans still like anything with a light saber but this movie was bad. I couldn't even get thru the last 25% of the movie. The part where Princess Leia magically flew back to the ship in space was so cheesy and awful. This movie was as bad as the ones made in the 90s.","true":true}
