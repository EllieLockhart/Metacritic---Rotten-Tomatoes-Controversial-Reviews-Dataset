Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was trash. Complete and utter trash. The John Williams score and beautiful visuals can't redeem the the this film.\\n\\nThe brain dead plot. The uninspiring and underdeveloped characters. The destruction of the beloved OT characters. It pretty much got everything wrong.\\n\\nThe thing that annoyed me the most about the film though is the buying off of the so called professional critics.","true":true}
