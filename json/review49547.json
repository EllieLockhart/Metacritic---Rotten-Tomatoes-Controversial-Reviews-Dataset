Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow is all I have to say at the extreme lack of effort put into these films.  Leah can fly?  Luke drinks milk from this aliens breast that even gives Rey a look that says \\\"Yup Disney just got your money\\, continue sucking from the Teet\\\".  Oh yea back to Leah flying\\, all the while surviving the vacuum of space! She then proceeds to return to the ship and they open a door for her\\, yet magically no-one is sucked outside?  Rey's parents are revealed to be a bunch of nobodies\\, given one line in the film.  She continues to use force powers at an unbelievable skill level despite still no training whatsoever.  The whole movie literally feels \\\"forced\\\" lol.  Either too much coke on the table or not enough when they wrote this one.  I feel like they just plan out the toys and marketing\\, making the film last.","true":true}
