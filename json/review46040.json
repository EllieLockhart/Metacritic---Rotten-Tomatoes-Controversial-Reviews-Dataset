Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning; but I had problems with the storyline\\, the directing; the screenplay. It was distracting and half assed. Won't be seeing it again like I did with Rogue One or other Star Wars films.","true":true}
