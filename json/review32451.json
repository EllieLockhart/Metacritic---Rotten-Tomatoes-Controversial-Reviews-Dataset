{"101487":169994,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars just seems to get better and better nowadays\\, especially coming after a 15-year hiatus and the two terrible prequels from the early 2000s (don't let your childhood nostalgia cloud your judgment-The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones SUCKED).  The franchise's comeback wasn't exactly an immediate one\\, but rather slow-building.  Revenge of the Sith was a step up from the first two prequels\\, but it unfortunately carried over many of the same flaws.  The Force Awakens was a good return to form\\, and Rogue One was by far the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. It only makes sense that The Last Jedi would continue the franchise's ongoing hot streak\\, which it thankfully does.\\n\\nEpisode 8 already has an edge over Episode 7 because it is not a loose remake of The Empire Strikes Back (Attack of the Clones felt a lot more like that).  Without giving away any more spoilers\\, I can confirm there is no city floating above a non-solid state of matter (though there is a seaport city)\\, and Rey does not lose her hand.  But that is not to say the poetry doesn't rhyme anymore.  The Last Jedi takes it up a notch in that it seems to have more parallels with the classic SW video game Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords.  Director Rian Johnson must've taken some notes from Chris Avellone\\, because like KOTOR 2\\, TLJ delves into the themes of the moral implications of the Light and the Dark\\, whether or not the Jedi and the Sith are inherently good or evil\\, and the grayness of their actions.  Nevertheless\\, both KOTOR 2 and TLJ make their point by reinforcing the concept of Good conquering Evil in the end.\\n\\nThese themes are made explicit in the character arcs of Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker.  I won't give much away\\, but I will say they are both characterized as skeptics\\, often questioning what they were led to believe\\, only to draw their own conclusions represented thoroughly in the climax.  Though their destinations are different\\, they both have similar arcs with empathetic points of view.  But Luke and Kylo aren't the only characters who develop thoroughly.  For once\\, Rey finally gets her due\\, with a journey of her own.  She's first determined to learn the ancient ways of the past\\, but then is driven to figure out whether those ways still apply to the present\\, and becomes the key to what Luke and Kylo stand for.  And she is still growing by the end of the movie\\, with secrets about herself still yet to be found.  In two and a half hours\\, she has come a long way from the reactive innocent girl stranded in a sparsely populated desert.  These three characters and their journeys constitute The Last Jedi's heart\\, its thematic and emotional core.\\n\\nIn the meantime\\, there is also the other story involving the wild goose chase with Finn\\, Poe\\, & company.  When you get down to it\\, their plot really just a fetch quest to help a stranded Resistance ship.  While not as deep and profound as Rey's story\\, it doesn't have to be.  It knows its place as a fun sci-fi extravaganza filled with grand spectacles\\, fast-paced action\\, sharp personalities\\, and a nice dosage of light wit.  All of this executed profoundly in a way that fans will still continue to care about the team\\, the most crucial element to engaging them in a fun action flick.  The essential emotional moments\\, both the joyful and the heart-wrenching\\, are all there.  Let Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke delve into the deeper themes\\, and let Finn\\, Poe\\, and the Resistance have their own fun adventure.  What more can you ask for?\\n\\nFinal verdict:\\nThe Last Jedi gave me a screen-gasm.","true":true}
