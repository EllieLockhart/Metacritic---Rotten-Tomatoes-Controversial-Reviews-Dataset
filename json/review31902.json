Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler free: Rian Johnson took a lot of risks\\, most paid off but some didn\u2019t. I think the biggest flaw with the film was that the pacing felt off. Characters and plot lines were shoved around into specific positions and occasionally this made the story feel disjointed. But I liked the film a lot primarily because it handled the most important storyline \u2014 Rey\u2019s struggle with learning about the force \u2014 extremely well. That was the toughest part of the story to get right and I think Johnson did a fantastic job with it. Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley put on incredible acting displays. Overall I enjoyed it!","true":true}
