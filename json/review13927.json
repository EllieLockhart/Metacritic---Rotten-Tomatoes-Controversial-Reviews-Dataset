Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are one of the group claiming that this is the worst entry ever\\, I invite you to re-watch the prequels (or did you even see them once?)\\, especially TPM and AotC.  Both were horrible.  Yes\\, I am old enough that I have seen all of the films in their original theatrical releases at the theater - make of that what you will.\\n\\nOdd how everyone complained about Lucas\\, and now many seem to think he would have done a better job.  Just because this film wasn't perfect doesn't make it horrible.  There were slow parts\\, and some things certainly didn't make sense (why use a ground cannon?)\\, but there was more character complexity than in any of the other films\\, the source of the Force was basically re-reestablished as something mystical rather than something you could ask your doctor if you had come down with\\, there was a change in direction rather than a reliance on the past\\, and a chance to set up entirely new possibilities.  I welcome the possible shake-up that comes.\\n\\nAgain\\, the film isn't perfect\\, but many viewers are being unduly harsh because they haven't been spoon-fed the same old stuff that they're used to getting.","true":true}
