Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ruins star wars and everything we know and love this is one big faliure for Rian Johnson even attack of the clones was better then this trash. I literally hate Disney for this and will never forgive them my heart is broken.","true":true}
