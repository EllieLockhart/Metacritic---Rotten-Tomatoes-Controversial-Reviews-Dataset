Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It gets a half-star because I got to see the words \\\"Star Wars\\\" floating in space after a two year wait. Otherwise\\, what do either Episodes 7 or 8 have anything to do with the iconic movies George Lucas created. What an awful movie on so many levels. What was a jewel of a story has now been pawned off\\, and it's recipients have treated it with all the respect of costume jewelry. The professional critics must have watched a different film than the one I just sat through.","true":true}
