Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars because it is an absolutely beautiful movie. The visuals are perfect! however\\, I don't even consider myself to be a hardcore fan. and I was really disappointed in the way characters were treated. the new character\\, Ray\\, is like a superhuman with the force\\, combat\\, and as a pilot. I like her\\, but who can relate to such a bad ass? not only that\\, but what about the other Jedi's who actually had to be trained? The tomatometer score\\, btw\\, what a joke. I no longer have any confidence in that. rotten tomatoes has been bought","true":true}
