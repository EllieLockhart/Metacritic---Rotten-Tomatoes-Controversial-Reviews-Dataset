Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't  bother.\\n\\nThis was a joke. Literally made this into a sci-fi comedy. Fight scenes were underwhelming. What they did with Leia during a particular scene (if you see it or already saw it you know what I'm referring to)\\, Snoke\\, Kylo\\, and Luke most importantly was disgraceful after a two year build up to this.\\n\\nWhy only ONE star: This movie is not action packed\\, it doesn't make you think\\, or wonder. The magic of the previous films is missing from this. This was a classic Disney forced humor movie with a very simplistic plot that was drawn out.\\n\\nWithout spoiling it just skip it. This has 0 to do with expecting The Empire Strikes Back and more to do with wanting a cohesive story with a powerful villain who is completely evil and not conflicted. \\n\\nRecommendation: Use the money on stocking stuffers instead.","true":true}
