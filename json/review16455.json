Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm still astounded this movie has a high critical rating. Even people that like the movie give a pre-emptive \\\"sure\\, the casino scene was bad\\, but...\\\" \\n\\nIt wasn't only a bad Star Wars movie to me\\, it was just a bad movie. This is from a guy who liked \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" and \\\"Looper.\\\" If the movie was so funny\\, why wasn't there laughter in the theater? I'd hear an occasional \\\"ha.\\\"\\n\\nIt almost seems like it appeals to people who don't like Star Wars. It's almost as if Rian Johnson is trolling Star Wars fans and non-Star Wars fans like to see the series mocked or something. \\n\\nI can't think of an interesting character in this story\\, besides Kylo Ren\\, and even he wasn't utilized. \\n\\nAlso\\, it's not only subversions that make a plot interesting\\, it actually has to be graceful and well-thought-out. Luke tossing his lightsaber after JJ Abrams hard work to set up that moment is like coming back to \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" and having Darth Vader say \\\"Luke\\, I lied. I'm not your father.\\\" Then he farts in his suit and can't breathe. See\\, we didn't expect that\\, but notice how it ruins the previous movie\\, while managing to be really unfunny--how is that worthy of a 90%?\\n\\nEnough has been said. Lucasfilm\\, please stay far away from Rian Johnson.","true":true}
