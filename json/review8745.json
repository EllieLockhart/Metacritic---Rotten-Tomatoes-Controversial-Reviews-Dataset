Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"for an epic story\\, and we got this diluted\\, confusing mess.\\n\\nZero character development. No questions answered. Luke's character and story arc disgraced. So many puzzlingly out of place and uninteresting new characters introduced. A series of mini plots that aside from being silly or pointless\\, were just kinda boring.\\n\\nThis movie felt like it went in a giant circle - I'm not sure how it moved the overall story forward. I'd love to believe that the next installment could redeem this one\\, but no matter how good it is I don't think it's possible. The Last Jedi ruined this trilogy for me.","true":true}
