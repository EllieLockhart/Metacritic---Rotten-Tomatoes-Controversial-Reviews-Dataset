Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah\\, the more I think about it after watching this movie - Star Wars is now going to be video rentals for me going forward.  I've seen reviews that talk about the \\\"mythology\\\" being gone from the series now\\, yep\\, that is accurate.  The end of Rouge One\\, with Darth Vader slaughtering Rebels in that hall\\, is the basic equivalent of what happened here - Disney = Darth Vader\\, Star Wars Universe = Rebels.","true":true}
