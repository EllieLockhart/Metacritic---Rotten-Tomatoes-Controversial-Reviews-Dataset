Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am very very dissapointed with what they have done to starwars.  They need to understand that this isnt a new franchise or something totally new they are coming up with. This is a very beloved franchise where parents show the origal trilogies to their kids and their kids to theirs and they all loved it and that is why there are so many fans. Thats why there are so many pissed of people with what they did. If you dont like it or think it should be totally different then invent a new franchise or whatever but leave star wars alone.  Dont try to playoff its fame to try to kickstart this new one buy changing everything around and bringing in old characters that people loved and turning them into crap. All u did was just piss true fans off!!!!","true":true}
