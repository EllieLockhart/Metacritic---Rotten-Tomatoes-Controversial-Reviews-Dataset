{"101487":127444,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"he Force has become like Harry Potter magic\\, with a new spell every day or so.\\n\\nRey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.\\n\\nSnoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier\\, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).\\n\\nLuke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.\\n\\nYoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck\\, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin\\, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?\\n\\nRose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker\\, and find not one but TWO code breakers\\, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean\\, is that magical or what?\\n\\nLeia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force\\, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen\\, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!\\n\\nI could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense\\, the inane attempt at comedy\\, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation\\, the stupid casino subplot\\, the stupid \\\"saving\\\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops\\, I did go on and on.\\n\\nIf you make a movie\\, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from.","true":true}
