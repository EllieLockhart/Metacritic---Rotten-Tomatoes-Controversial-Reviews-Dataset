Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something is strange with Rotten Tomatoes Calculations.  Look at Top critic  Matthew Lickona.  He rated Last Jedi a 2 out of 5 and Rotten Tomatoes interpreted that as fresh.  Also\\, Top Critic Leah Pickett obviously didn't even watch this movie as she describes Luke as a wise and patient teacher of Rey.  The only reviews I trust are the fan written reviews.  I don't trust Rotten Tomatoes calculations.  This was a bad movie and it seems that there is a coordinated effort to pass it off as good.","true":true}
