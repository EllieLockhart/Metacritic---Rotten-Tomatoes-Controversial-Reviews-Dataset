Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies of 2017. While not perfect\\, it had me on the edge of my seat... I've never had a movie\/theater experience like this before - I didn't know what was going to happen next. I can understand and respect why some would not like this movie. I used to be a die hard Star Wars fan who obsessed about lore details. As an adult I care more about moment to moment impact\\, emotion\\, humor\\, and surprise\/wonder.. This movie surprised and moved me multiple times. (Spoiler) It feels like the movie and series are breaking from the tired old usual mold of Good vs. Evil\\, and into something different. We already had that story arc with episodes 1-6. (Jedi vs Sith\\, Empire vs Rebellion) To phrase what Luke said (in the trailers) it's time for the Jedi to end.","true":true}
