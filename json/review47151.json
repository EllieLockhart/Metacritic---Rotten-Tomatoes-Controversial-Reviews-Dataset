Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess - From Leia in space to Snoke being a bit thick. The story has no coherence\\, no arc.  Critics normally have a more informed view of what comprises a good film.  Not so with Star Wars - this is different\\, it belongs to the fans. Abrams understood that - Johnson doesn't. All the good work of Awakens undone. Star Wars has died along with a character loosely resembling Luke Skywalker. RIP.","true":true}
