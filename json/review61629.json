The story of the first part is beautiful. This love between Joel and Ellie was real. So why don't you show the love between Dina and Ellie? Where is the chemistry between these characters? Or you just said\\, This is an LGBT couple\\, they love each other for the sake of a tick. If they love each other\\, show it. This game is a disappointment of the year. I do not know what else to say. This game has no advantages other than graphics. It does not deserve 96 points. it's a bad game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
