Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the biggest disappointment of the year and a complete waste of potential; I guess that's what happens when you switch directors half-way through a trilogy. The newest episode of the Star Wars saga is unfortunately met with more criticism than praise from me\\, so I'll start with what I liked. \\nWhile extremely dissatisfied with what I have recently seen\\, even I must admit that Star Wars 8 has some things going for it. Like any Star Wars movie\\, good or bad\\, the costume design is always top-notch. The Last Jedi keeps the streak alive with more interesting robes and armors for the characters to wear throughout the film; the Imperial Royal Guard-esque uniforms for Snoke's elite guards were slick. Another must for Star Wars movies is high-end visuals. Once again\\, The Last Jedi does just that\\, delivering high-quality Star Destroyers\\, a wide variety of alien races\\, and the lightsaber blades are still badass. The score composed by the iconic John Williams is an exceptional collection of Star Wars nostalgia\\, although not as present as it is in other films; the sound design ain't too shabby either. While more than likely just a marketing scheme\\, the porgs are cute like the Ewoks and might've been the best comic relief in the entire film. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are both really talented up and coming actors and I assume they both have bright futures ahead of them\\, and while not their best work\\, the performances they're putting into the Star Wars films are solid. Ridley believably shows Rey's inner-confliction and craving to learn more about her gifts while Driver effectively displays the anger and frustration that has built up in Kylo Ren; I assume they both only get better in the final chapter. Carrie Fisher provides an emotional performance in what may be one of the last times we see Leia on the big screen (I can't imagine she'll have much of a role if any in episode 9). These are the things I liked...I guess. \\nIf you haven't heard\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has been very divisive among audiences; some people really enjoyed the film\\, while others have a burning animosity towards the movie. I find myself leaning towards the latter for these reasons: almost all the humor feels forced and does not land\\, the three storylines that go on throughout the whole film feel very jumbled and poorly paced\\, the new side characters are annoying\\, the villains are weak and\/or disposed of in an orderly fashion\\, Rey barely develops as a character if at all\\, the movie is longer than it needed to be\\, and the writing is lazy; it felt as if director Rian Johnson wanted to remove almost all of J.J. Abrams' influence from episode 7 and start off fresh. It doesn't work. I found myself dozing in the first half of the film and cringing in the second\\, it was that bad. To begin the film there is some banter between two characters (I'm going to be very careful about not spoiling anything). I did not find it amusing and it went against the seriousness of one of the antagonists. Since the movie just began I pushed my worries aside thinking there is still a lot of time left for things to get better; I might as well have left that very moment. From there\\, there are even more silly moments that are neither humorous or Star Wars-like; a solid half hour if not a full one could've been shaved from the film's runtime. As much as I would like to elaborate on my other criticisms\\, out of not wanting to spoil the film at all (because I know people hate that)\\, I'll just give you a quick word of advice: You may go into Star Wars: The Last Jedi and come out not understanding why all the hate\\, believing that episode 8 is one of the best Star Wars films to date. That's fine\\, I wish I could see it that way. Or you may come out feeling neutral. Or you may come out feeling betrayed and extremely underwhelmed wondering where $200 million went. If you liked The Force Awakens and\/or Rogue One\\, you won't necessarily like this one. \\nIn conclusion\\, I guess you should go see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and develop your own opinion\\, just try to temper expectations.","true":true}
