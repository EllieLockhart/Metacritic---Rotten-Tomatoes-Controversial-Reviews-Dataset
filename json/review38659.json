Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the worst star wars movie yet. its hard to pinpoint any one thing as most of its awful. bland main character\\, poorly portrayed villain\\, snoke is pointless\\, lei pulls a space jesus\\, luke over acting\\, it just goes on and on. if you have to watch it\\, rent it.","true":true}
