Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was doubtful about this movie\\, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think the biggest reason why I liked it\\, is that I was not expecting anything. A lot of SW fans have been building up theories and hopes about what answers can be given\\, I saw it as another Disney movie where they will try to appease the masses. In a way this feels like an origin movie and not the middle installment in this trilogy. In general though the movie made me smile\\, I did enjoy it\\, and I most likely will see it again prior to the next movie. I do not need to have this movie in my DVD collection so to say. \\n\\nI liked how they could run so many storylines simultaneously and bring it all together nicely\\, but yes\\, there are plot holes. \\n\\nSpoilers!\\n\\nEverything regarding Captain Phasma just made me feel disappointed though\\, cannot understand the focus on her. \\n\\nAdmiral Holdo's scenes were good\\, but the time it took her to decide to turn the ship around was too long and the scene was extended longer than need be. \\n\\nPoe was a bit weaker and hot-headed than I remembered from The Force Awakens\\, but makes sense in this plot. \\n\\nRey was really good. Liked how much stronger her character (acting) was during this movie than in the previous. \\n\\nLuke\\, they could have developed his character a lot more to give more understanding of his choices. It takes guts though to start everything off with him tossing away his lightsaber.","true":true}
