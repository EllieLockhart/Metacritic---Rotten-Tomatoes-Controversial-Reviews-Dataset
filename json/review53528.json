Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining Star Wars movie. Not one I would put ahead of any of the original movies but certainly more in keeping with the originals. The criticism of the movie seems to be coming from a vocal minority of Prequel fans angry that these are closer to the OT. Remember when the Force was just the Force rather than some sort of bacteria and the Emperor was this evil figure without a backstory or name that was ever mentioned in the first 3 films?","true":true}
