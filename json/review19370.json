Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really difficult to sum up this movie without giving too much away. To keep it simple\\, this movie forgot that it was supposed to be episode 8 and just acted like a poor recreation of episode 5. I hope Disney gets their act together and makes episode 9 with some original ideas. \\n\\nThis movie was very visually beautiful and there were good moments for sure\\, but the pace that everything happened was very forced and there was little to no character\/plot development where it mattered. You will basically watch a long movie of okay explosions while somehow still missing the intensity that you would come to expect from a star wars film.","true":true}
