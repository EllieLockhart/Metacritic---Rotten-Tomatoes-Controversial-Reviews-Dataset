Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first heard Disney had bought Lucasfilm I was overjoyed. We were finally going to get new Star Wars films again! We are going to see where our heroes had gone. But instead of giving us our heros with valor\\, dignity\\, and honor. they tore our hero's apart and made them failures. And for what? To make room for Mary Sue? Good grief. They gave us a Han that leaves Leah and is killed by his dark son and a  broken Luke that isn't even willing to fight for good anymore. One that literally dies because he won't leave his island to defend his friends. My heroes have been massively disrespected.  It's a broken hearted time for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
