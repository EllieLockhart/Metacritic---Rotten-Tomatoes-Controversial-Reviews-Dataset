{"101487":174992,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-13","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi did do something that ive never experienced before\\, it caused me to check my phone every 30 minutes whilst watching it because it truly made me feel like i was wasting my time\\, the only part i only enjoyed was the final battle\\, i couldn't give a crap about the capitalism or animal abuse BS\\, oh and the comedy\\, where the hell is jar jar binks when you need him!  utterly disappointed with this film...","true":true}
