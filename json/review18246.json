Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the action and architecture was well done even liked some of the character adjustments to Rey and Kylo.  My main issue with this movie is the the treatment of Luke. He is supposed to be an uplifting character who had already solved most of his internal conflict in Return of the Jedi. I mean come on he had already faced the most evil bean in the galaxy and rejected him. \\nThe other problem with this movie is the heavy handed marketing approach especially the last scene with the children. That scene should have been cut it didn't add to the story at all. There is also the fact that I still have no idea where the First Order comes from and why the \\\"Resistance\\\" seems have such a fluctuating power base.","true":true}
