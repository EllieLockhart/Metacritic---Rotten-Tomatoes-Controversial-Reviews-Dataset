Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well you did it\\, you killed it. You killed this movie this franchise and all of it's heroes. Mark Hamil finally got the chance to relive his favorite character and you turned him into a crying baby. The man who sacrificed everything to save his friends. Luke willingly walked into the hands of the empire to face the Emperor\\, the most powerful force of evil in the movie because he thought there was a chance to save his father. He didn't care if he would die as long as he could try to save Vader\\, but in this movie he gets scared of Ben\\, tries to kill him and gets his ass kicked by a kid\\, then runs away to hid and die on an island. I hope you are proud of destroying Star Wars.","true":true}
