Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars movie ever made.  I really don't care what the fans think.  If they don't like it\\, it's because the film is so complex and deep that they can't comprehend it's intricacies.  Screw Abrams\\, nothing that happened in TFA matters. And who cares what will happen in IX...I don't.  This movie made a ton of money so it must be good.","true":true}
