Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot itself felt like there was a checklist of things to cover and it just went down the line to do this. Because of this there were a number of holes within the plot showing themselves through jump cuts and portions of the story just missing.\\n\\nPaired with this were the random moments where myself and others and the theater just looked at eachother with confusion on our faces. The comedic moments were forced and there were a number of them unnecessarily.\\n\\nVisually it was stunning\\, but story wise it was poor. I'd take a poor looking movie with a great story any day over what I saw in the theater.","true":true}
