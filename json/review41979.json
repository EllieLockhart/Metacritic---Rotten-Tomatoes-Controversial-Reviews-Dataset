Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie left little to my and others imagination on what will occur in the final entry into this 3 part saga. It effectivly sttunted the progression of the story for the movie that will soon proceed it\\, utterly flawed is how i would describe this entry. Though\\, it did try to chart some interesting roots for the story\\, in the end\\, the movie favored shocking the viewer over producing a quality experience. In conclusion\\, incredibly dissapointing star wars movie.","true":true}
