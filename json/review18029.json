Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the story was written with the insight of a 3rd grader.  The ideas that made Star Wars special were shredded in the Disney machine that is more interested in selling toys and video games then telling a good story.  It was a terrible waste of the classic characters that were hardly a shadow of their former selves.  The 2 stars are for a fight scene and a few laughs from Chewy.","true":true}
