Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This probably the laziest bit of screenwriting and directing I have ever seen. If you like Joss Whedon-esque gags every 10 minutes in a movie that has very little pay off\\, this one is for you!","true":true}
