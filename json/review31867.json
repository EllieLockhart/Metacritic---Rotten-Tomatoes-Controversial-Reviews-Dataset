Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"!!SPOILER ALERT!!\\n\\nI am a true Star Wars fan\\, and an open minded one at that. That means even though the prequels were somewhat of a disappointment I can appreciate theme none the less. They serve a purpose. I can say that the latest trilogy does.\\n\\nI was so excited for the Force Awakens an like 90% of other Star Wars fans\\, left the cinema thinking I'd just watched A New Hope. For two years I waited with anticipation for the next instalment of the Saga. Leading up to it I hear Ryan Johnson has been given his own Trilogy. How could The Last Jedi be a disappointment if Lucasfilm and Disney are willing to trust its writer and director with something like that?\\n\\nSo\\, I let the hype die down\\, even though I do like a good atmosphere in the cinema\\, I don't like it too packed.\\n\\nThe film starts\\, the text scrolls and I can actually feel Goosebumps\\, I AM SO EXCITED.\\n\\nSo\\, we have out epic space battle required of every Star Wars movie\\, fine. This is followed by the resistance\\, or is it the rebellion (this film doesn't seem to know what its called) jump to light speed only to be tracked through hyperspace and caught up with by the first order. Leia\\, astounded says \\\"They tracked us through hyperspace\\\" of course that's something that must be unheard of? (Cast you mind back to the end of Rogue One and the beginning of A New Hope.) Taintive 5 pursued by the evil Darth Vader on his Star Destroyer moments after it jumped to light speed fleeing the battle over Scarif.\\n\\nThe main plot follows out Heroes trying to outrun the First Order before they run out of fuel\\, apparently inertia isn't a thing in space!\\n\\nThen we have a side mission for Finn and new box ticker Rose who go off to Casino land in search of a code breaker so the tracker which apparently is only installed on a single star destroyer can be turned off\\, only to fail their mission and watch as their fleet of escape pods is destroyer ONE BY ONE.\\n\\nMeanwhile\\, also failing their mission is Rey who is trying to get the\\, now hermit\\, Luke Skywalker to re-join the rebellion. She enters a cave heavily shrouded by the dark side of the force looking for answers only to find herself looking back (Degobah?)\\n\\nAnyway\\, after a few skype call with Kylo Ren\\, she decides to go and meeting him on snokes star destroyer\\, after a brief moment in the lift insisting Kylo still had good in him they entered Snokes throne room when Snoke subsequently trieds to tempt Rey with the dark side\\, failes and then shows her the fleet of rebels being destroyed followed by being killed by Kylo (ROTJ)\\n\\nA small amount of rebels finally get to the ice\\, I men salt planet to hide in their new lair just before TFO plonk their ATAT's 10 miles away (ESB)\\n\\nBy now I've checked my watch so many times its unreal. The film finally ends as Luke saves the day by projecting his self ten billion miles to give them others enough time to escape from the unescapable cave\\, after that he dies for no reason. \\n\\nLast shot\\, some kid staring at the twin suns (ANH)\\n\\nEnd\\n\\nIn Summary...\\n\\n*Its too long\\n*It has pointless sub plots\\n*Too Much box ticking\\n*Too many characters\\n*To much recycling of original stuff\\n*Yet another disappointment\\n*Final decision made on whether to avoid Solo. Avoid.\\n\\nThat said I hope you like it","true":true}
