Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely worst thing to come out of Lucas Films ever.\\n\\nMan I had such high hopes for this movie which turned a promising trilogy into complete and udder trash. I had such hope for Rey who turned out to be a Mary Sue character (not the only one)\\, Snokes story turns out to be just a red haring. I don't know how anyone is saying it's original\\, with it borrowing so heavily from Episodes V\\, & VI  while doing a piss poor job of it. There is a complete 30 minutes of the movie that serves no purpose other than delivery a political\\, social justice message that slows down the movie even more. Which would have been fine had it actually added something to the movie\\, character development instead of being preached at.\\n\\nIn the end I would gladly accept my money back and a apology from Lucas Films and Disney. Not for letting me down but for what is such a obvious fan exploitation money grab\\, and thumbing of their nose to anyone who says it. You say you don't need the fan base to like the movie (catering to the fans) let's see how wallets and purses vote for you. I can honestly say I look for strong female leads in movies for something to expose my daughter to Rey had that potential in TFA\\, you even did it in Rouge one and suddenly my daughter enjoyed star wars then you turned Rey into this Mary Sue character and she's no longer interested.","true":true}
