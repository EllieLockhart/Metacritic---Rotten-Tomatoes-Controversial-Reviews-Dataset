Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a normal film it was okay but for a Star Wars film it was awful. I would rather watch the Phantom Menace\\, Jar Jar and all then see this movie again. \\n   The main issues I had with the film were (without too many spoilers or getting too salty)- too much humor that was out of place and not very funny\\,  too much BB 8 interference killing development of other characters\\, Luke and some of the original trilogy characters were written to act contrary too their established personalities\\, I found the script\/ story lacking of depth and quality and had  a lot of wasted opportunity\\, lightsabers yes.. but here is no duel with them ...... do I need to say why this is a problem in a star wars film?\\, anything Fin did was mostly pointless in the story making you start to wonder why he  is even there.\\n\\nWhen I saw the film I was slightly entertained but overall I was mostly disappointed. Aslo later  that night when my family asked me if I liked the movie I told them that \\\"It was just one of many reminders that my childhood is DEAD\\\".","true":true}
