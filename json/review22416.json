Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left a lot of things unanswered from the previous film Force Awakens\\, also has many plot holes that the audience is just supposed to accept. The whole story of rose and Finn and the casino felt very outta place and slowed the pace of the film. We never got any explanation about who's Snoke was\\, not the worst star wars but definitely not the best at all. I gave this a  1\/2 star because it won't let me give 0 stars","true":true}
