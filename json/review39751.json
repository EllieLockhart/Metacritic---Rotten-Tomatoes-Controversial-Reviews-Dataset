Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a horrible film on many levels. It fails or violates most principles of conveying a story through pictures\\, the largest is that there is no story. The characters have no arc\\, growth or development. We are given no insight or answers to the burning questions left by episode VII. The director essentially raped and destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker--I can only assume Mr. Johnson did not watch the previous seven movies. This film broke me\\, and I've lost all faith in humanity.","true":true}
