Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So this is the 'Millennial' Star Wars. This is NOT made for people like me - the original fans. Who remember Han shooting Greedo first. Luke getting his hand chopped off. Leia being turned into a sex-slave. NOPE. \\nThis is the Everything is Awesome version - where bad guys are 'emotionally conflicted'\\, and 100 rebels can defeat an entire ARMADA of Evil because\\, Girl Power!\\n\\nSo get ready to hate me for this but.... I didn't much like The Last Jedi.\\n\\nIt just felt like a bunch of excitement and hype\\, a ton of action and explosions... and so-so set pieces that went on for 2 hours and 30minutes and in the end left me feeling blank.\\n\\nwe are now left with a 40-year Star Wars movie history and a big BLANK spot for parts 7 and 8.\\n\\nI'm not sure WHAT the 'Big surprise' was. I must have blinked when it happened This was a very by-the-numbers movie with no major twists or 'WTF' moments. No emotional attachments. Just a bunch of cool looking spaceships  and some pointless penguin bird thingies that will make great Lego toys in time for Christmas 2017\\n\\nThis movies was as much a money grab as Mayweather versus McGregor.Most annoying for me - Last Jedi doesn't bother to answer ANY questions to fill in the blanks or move the story forwards. \\n\\nSo many questions!\\n\\nWho is Rey - where did she come from - and why she is so damn powerful?\\nHow can she resist the Dark Side with ZERO training?\\nIs Kylo truly EVIL\\, or just emotionally stunted?\\nAre we stuck with this whiny\\, tantrum-throwing Emo punk with Daddy\/Mother\/Uncle issues??\\nExactly Who runs the First Order??\\nWho TF is Supreme Leader Snoke??\\nIs Luke now the Grand Master of ALL Jedi?\\nWhere is the Jedi Academy?\\nIs Rey actually the LAST of the Jedi?\\nWhere are all the OTHER rebel forces?\\n\\nThere are a few more plot holes in this movie but I won't go into all of them. If you haven't seen it yet\\, don't let my review stop you. Apparently a lot of people really like it.\\n\\nit just left me feeling blah and annoyed. I went home afterwards in threw in 'Rogue One'. STILL the greatest 2-minute sequence in the entire Star Wars saga! :D\\n\\n2 1\/2 stars","true":true}
