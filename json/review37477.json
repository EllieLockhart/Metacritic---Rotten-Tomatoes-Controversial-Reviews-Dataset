Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to start. Just search YouTube for on of hundreds of videos discussing all the mistakes\\, nonsense\\, and lost opportunities. Disney has officially destroyed the Star Wars franchise. As for all the FAKE positive reviews by the \\\"Critics\\\"\\, it shows how deceitful and money hungry Disney has become in their attempt to squeeze as much juice out of this lemon before it's completely rotten.","true":true}
