But this is not a story that you expect or wish for after playing The Last Of Us part I. In my opinion there isn't even a story. You just go to a city to take revenge on someone because that someone took revenge. That is the story. The game makes you loveFirst of all I'm a big fan of the Uncharted series and the first game so I started this game thinking it would be another masterpiece. But this is not a story that you expect or wish for after playing The Last Of Us part I. In my opinion there isn't even a story. You just go to a city to take revenge on someone because that someone took revenge. That is the story. The game makes you love certain people\\, but also tries to let you hate them. Other people you hate\\, you are forced to love. Naughty Dog tried something different and for me they failed. They made a game that you don't like to play but it will keep you locked to your screen for almost 25 hours. In the second part of the game you just hope that it will soon be over so you can go back to what you think is the main story. Sadly enough that second part is half the game. So I loved the first 10 hours\\, was bored during the next 10 and ultimately I was depressed during the last 5. So if you are looking for a beautiful\\, well-made game with a non existing story that will give such intense feelings (good and bad) that you end up with a depression afterwards: buy The Last Of Us Part II\u2026 Expand","true":true}
