Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all these smart people in Hollywood\\, how is it possible to make such a poor movie?  You would think that after all these years since the original Star Wars\\, the movies would get better with experience\\, technology\\, bigger budgets\\, etc.  The special effects in The Last Jedi were horrible.   The numerous ships popping out of hyperspace to an abrupt stop was ultra cheesy...reminded me of the 50's and 60's flying saucer movie graphics.  You know the CGI is bad when you get distracted by it throughout the entire movie. With good CGI you might start the critiquing it\\, but after a few scenes it is so good you forget to look for it for the rest of the movie.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, I am a first generation Star Wars fan.  It is not my purpose to trash the franchise...I am just utterly disappointed how these mega studios and genius directors are so blind.\\n\\nAside from the poor CGI\\, this movie was missing humor\\, character charisma and a decent storyline.   Some of the scenes were amateurish.  The casino scene was pressed and lacking \\\"Lucas-Like\\\" vision.  The Fathier horse escape scene was an insult to the audience.  The red ninja guard battle had to be the worst fight choreography in the entire franchise.\\n\\nOverall it is hard to pin down everything that was wrong in just a few paragraphs\\, but overall it was missing what the Force Awakens has\\, Rey and Finn together\\, humor\\, fun story and  lots of Chewy.  Without Harrison around to carry the franchise\\, at least show more of Chewy.","true":true}
