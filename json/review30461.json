Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shallow plot and way to many banal statements that sound good on the surface but have no consistency with the rest of the movie. Example: \\\" The war is just beginning.\\\" Um no\\, it is not\\, you have been fighting the first order (lets be honest\\, a cliche empire created so shallow fans can root for the underdog resistance\\, because rooting for the underdog makes everyone feel good.) for 2 movies now. The writers put no thought into this script or how it relates to the Force Awakens\\, but I don't blame them because the Force Awakens set the originality bar VERY low.","true":true}
