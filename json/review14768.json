Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have read so much negativity about The Last Jedi on the internet and am at a loss to understand what those fans were looking for. Johnson's writing and direction were bold and took Star Wars into new and exciting territory. It felt to me that he successfully managed the fine balance between respecting and referencing the previous saga while pushing forward into a much needed new era. There was also balance between humour\\, emotional drama\\, exhilarating speed\\, all those important cinematic elements. John Williams' score brought me to tears as always\\, as of course did Carrie's final performance.","true":true}
