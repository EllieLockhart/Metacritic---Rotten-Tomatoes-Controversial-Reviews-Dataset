{"101487":194635,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-22","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well then.... The Last Jedi is a very divided movie\\, but i cam see both the positive and the negative stuff about it. For me\\, this is probably the best looking Star Wars film\\, i really like the rebels planet at the end of the film when people steps on the salt and it turns red\\, its pretty cool. I love the throne room battle involving Rey and Kylo it is choreographed very will. I don't mind the whole situation featuring Luke\\, i like to see a different take on this classic hero. John Williams music is still very good throughout. But like pretty much every Star Wars fan\\, I don't really care about the Casino plot\\, it really does fall out of place with the rest of the film\\, the chase(s) inside this storyline is forgettable and bland. The humour lands 50% while the other half doesn't. There are lots of plot holes in the film\\, quite few unanswered questions. The storyline involving Poe doesn't make sense the more you watch it\\, it just gets more confusing each time. Some characters were wasted\\, some new characters were abit pointless. I think Rian Johnson is a great writer and director\\, but his style of film-making doesn't match up to a franchise like Star Wars. I can rewatch this\\, I don't have massive problems that is forcing me to stay away from it\\, got some visual stunning moments\\, but a story with some plot points\\, some questionable decisions and humour that lands half of the time.. i think this is still a very good film.","true":true}
