Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was bad\\, and the sub plots felt so disconnected and contributed nothing to the plot\\, with borrowed scenes from the matrix\\, Independence Day and the life of the Buddha the movie felt cheap and not well thought off. The conclusion final scenes with (Rey\\, Kylo and Snoke) and (Kylo and Luke) were comical to say the least.\\nNot to get into details and ruin the movie\\, the dialogue was corny at best and all high moments felt forced\\, Kylo's character was so bad that it was laughable. This movie is an insult to Star Wars lovers what a shame.","true":true}
