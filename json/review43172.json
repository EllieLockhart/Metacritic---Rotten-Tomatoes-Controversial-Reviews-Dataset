Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This script has been wrecked leaving no decent future for the narrative to continue with the original fans. It's been made into a micky mouse franchise. literally! Killing off Luke as soon as he's introduced? What the frack is this guy on?? Idiots! I disown the franchise after 37 years of faithful following. Don't bother watching it. Unless they find a way to bring Luke back.. It's finished.
