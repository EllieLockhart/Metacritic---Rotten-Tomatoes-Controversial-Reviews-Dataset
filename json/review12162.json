Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a long time Star Wars fan.  When I was 10 I saw the first movie multiple times.  Ive enjoyed or loved the following movies.  Took my 11 yr old nephew to this Disney effort and as we walked out of the theater.. I said.. I looked at my watch 3 times.. he replied he did the same.  Both of us felt.. we wasted our time.  I did like a few scenes however.  Luke facing  down Kylo\\, seeing benicio.. some of Reys scenes.  Goodbye Star Wars.","true":true}
