Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\, I don't care what everyone is saying I loved it. I've watched these movies ever since I was a kid where the ESB (best star wars movie ever) was the first one I had seen and I immediately fell in love with this franchise and since than I've read the books watched the shows and seen all the movies multiple times (even the prequels). And this was a movie I was really looking forward to\\, now it definitely did not meet all my expectations and I felt there were some things that were rather dumb in it but some of the scenes  (especially the end scene with Luke)  I felt we're some of the best in all of Star Wars \\, I personally don't think this movie deserved the hate it got and I know there are still going to be countless people who don't like it And that's fine people are allowed to have their opinions but before someone tries arguing with me please go watch the Christmas or Ewok special and than I want you to try and tell me this was the worst Star Wars movie ever :)","true":true}
