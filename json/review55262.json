Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"La peor pel\u00edcula de Star Wars que han podido hacer\\, la han hecho. Poco mas que decir al respecto... Ning\u00fan inter\u00e9s por ver la pr\u00f3xima o cualquier otro proyecto de Star Wars con Disney o sin Disney. Directamente ya no hay mas Star Wars para mi. Larga vida a George Lucas\\, nunca me cansar\u00e9 de ver sus dos trilog\u00edas.","true":false}
