Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead. Disney will be sucking it dry and banking on the legacy of the name and franchise to make as much money as possible. Say what you will about the prequels and force awakens but at least it didnt disrespect and ruin the characters and legacy that we love so much. Fuck Rian and fuck Disney. Money hungry lazy pigs. The damage is irreversible and episode 9 is already looking bleak.","true":true}
