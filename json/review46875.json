Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well worth the wait and I was not disappointed!  Slightly choppy in sections and in need of those few minutes of film which were probably edited out but the story made sense and bound the various threads together in the end.","true":true}
