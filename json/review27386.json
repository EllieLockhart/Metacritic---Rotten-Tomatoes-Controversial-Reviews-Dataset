Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Our family loved it! \\n\\nFor me\\, this took me back to the '77 era films where each one offered something new and exciting to behold in the Star Wars universe. Characters on life\/galaxy changing journeys\\, shocking (and yet\\, somehow organic) plot twists\\, crazy imagination defying fantastic force feats (Ya\\, I'm a Stan Lee fan)  and just plain ol' good hypnotic story telling as expressed through brilliant movie making.  \\n\\nI think you'll enjoy this film if you approach it with with an open mind. If you pigeon hole the characters into old static models then...well... you might not enjoy it as much. Just give it a chance. We think you'll enjoy it. Peace. :)","true":true}
