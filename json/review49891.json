Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can't please every fan\\, especially when you are trying to break the mold and keep things fresh.  People hated on Empire when it came out and it is now regarded as the best Star Wars film.  TLJ could likely follow in its footsteps.  People hating on this film can't handle provocation for thought.  Luke isn't the stoic Jedi master you thought he would be?  Boo-f**king hoo.","true":true}
