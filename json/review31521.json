Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some where in there is a good movie\\, but this is not Star Wars. The humor and pacing were way off and that Leia scene was so stupid. A ton of plots that ultimately meant very little\\, and why all the cutesy creatures? Time will not be kind to this one. Maybe TFA was a copy of the original\\, but this movie doesn't understand what makes Star Wars special.","true":true}
