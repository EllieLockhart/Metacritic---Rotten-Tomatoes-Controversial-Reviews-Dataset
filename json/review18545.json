Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It just created a wealth of plot holes and mis-understood material. The movie showed little to no regard for the ground work laid. Some scenes shake the value and point of star wars at its core such as holdos suicide mission.","true":true}
