Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written characters\\, overall bad writing\\, failed to incorporate most of the plot points from the previous episode etc. I have no issue to what they did with Luke but the rest of the film just felt poorly written and put together.","true":true}
