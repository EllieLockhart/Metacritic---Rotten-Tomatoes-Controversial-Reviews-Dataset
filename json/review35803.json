Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is not just a bad Star Wars film\\, it is also a horrible movie. First\\, from a Star Wars perspective\\, the movie lacked any continuity with the new canon. One of the promises Disney made was that the disjointed nature of the Legends era would be remedied. Instead\\, there is virtually no connection between the characters and plots in the new books to the new movies at all. \\n\\nOne would have imagined\\, based on Bloodlines\\, that Leia would have spent the last 30 years forming alliances with the governors of powerful systems to mount a proper resistance to the First Order. A proper fleet of capital ships\\, spy networks\\, duplicitous politicians and emergent force users could have created a sense of the scale of the Star Wars galaxy and the leadership prowess of the Princess. \\n\\nThe ineptitude of the First Order flies in the face of the scale and scope of what this emergent galactic powerhouse has accomplished. Instead\\, it is cartoonish and wholly unbelievable. Good Sci-fi should allow you to suspend your disbelief without making you cringe at the absurdity of what you are witnessing. Capital ships being destroyed by a single fighter\\, Leia floating in space only to Mary Poppins her way back to the ship\\, Hux doing a Verizon commercial (\\\"can you hear me now?\\\")\\, Phasma being defeated by Finn (a washout trooper - again defying the new canon books)\\, not launching 1\\,000's of TIE's to wipe out Resistance squads and cruisers\\, etc.\\, etc. \\n\\nRey being a nobody is fine. Snoke dying with a whimper is fine. Luke being a has-been is fine. However\\, the representation that the Resistance can easily dispense with Star Destroyers (akin to the Rebels cartoon) and the utter weakness of the Dark Side leaves the movie flat and unsatisfying. If you must throw in politically motivated scenes of social injustices\\, at least have them tie in with the plot of the movie. This could have been masterful\\, with powerful new allies emerging on both sides\\, the winds of war waxing and waning with the struggle between the Light and the Dark and leaving us wanting more by ending with a real cliffhanger -- heroes on both sides in peril of some sort. The audience of 2017 is a more mature one - even the millennials. Depicting the First Orders as purely evil keystone cops bumbling through the galaxy sewing chaos is an insult. We should be shown tactical masterminds lead by authoritarian idealists. The Resistance should not all be depicted as altruistic underdog heroes who are as pure as the driven snow. These warriors must make decisions that are gray and murky at best - and sometimes make deals with the devil to advance the cause. Intellectual as well as thrilling entertainment is what the audience of today craves.\\n\\nMy fear is that Disney does not understand at all what they have and are satisfied with cheapening the franchise in order to cash in on the merchandizing of it. In my opinion\\, however\\, they are stepping over the dollars to pick up the dimes. They could make much more in the long run by cashing in on what is the best Sci-Fi treasure trove of content there is. In summary\\, the movie is a waste of time and a serious blow to Disney's credibility as the custodian of the franchise. Where Rogue One is everything Star Wars could be (with the best final six minutes of any movie ever)\\, The Last Jedi is what every Sci-Fi fan fears. Sure\\, it's making money now but at what cost for the future of Star Wars???","true":true}
