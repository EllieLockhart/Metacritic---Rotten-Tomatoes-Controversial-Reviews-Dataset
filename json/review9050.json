Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full disclosure\\, I am in my 40's\\, and saw every original movie in the theaters and had every single action figure when I was a kid.  I waiting in line for Episode on opening night\\, only to have my dreams shattered by bad writing and direction.  In short\\, I hated the prequels.  Fast forward 10 years to The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, I was thrilled to have that childhood glee re-kindled.  After seeing the Last Jedi\\, I left the theater not sure how to feel.  I neither loved\\, nor hated this movie.  It was just kind of a confusing mess for me.  Some of the scenes and action made me jump out of my seat\\, while other sequences pulled me out of the movie in Jar-Jar groan-inducing fashion.  I understand the Rian Johnson meant to burn the original concepts of Star Wars to the ground and build anew\\, but I am not quite sure if I like the final product.  I feel conflicted about this movie\\, and for a lifelong Star Wars superfan\\, that is not necessarily a good thing.","true":true}
