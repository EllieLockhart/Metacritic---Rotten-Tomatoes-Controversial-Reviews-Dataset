Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something is off with the jedi. they're suppose to be cool\\, calm\\, collective. Not anxious\\, hyper and emotional. I'll accept the sith being a little emorionally rageful cause that's them dealing with their darkness and anger. Also WTF is the deal with snoke? He could have been a great sith with an amazing backstory\\, but nothing. And Luke dusting off his shoulders was the stupidest crap ever. Wtf is happening to our beloved star wars? It's turning into a ham and cheese. ","true":true}
