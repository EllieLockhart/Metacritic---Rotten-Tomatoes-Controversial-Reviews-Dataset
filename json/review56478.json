Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is modern day cinema garbage. It's basically a super fancy title page with absolutely nothing else in the pages that follow. The hero's\\, villains\\, and plot is super generic. There's virtually no character building. Rey somehow becomes a Jedi master and Luke is a cranky old man now who hates the Jedi\\, after being the most optimistic\\, kind\\, and driven Jedi in the previous movies he was in. Maybe it's all that alien milk he's drinking?? The movie once again needlessly copies from previous Star Wars titles and leaves true Star Wars fans with little to look forward to in the next installment in this trilogy. I expected much better from Rian Johnson\\, escpecislly with the great writing and character build up in breaking bad\\, but somehow he completely missed the mark. I don't understand how his direction was so misguided\\, it makes me think he was either extremely rushed to make the script or was intentionally trying to sabotage it. Either way this film looks good on the surface\\, but if you look a little closely you'll easily see the pile of garbage that it is.","true":true}
