Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie yes there were issues and it wasnt my favorite a little long\\, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.  I liked some of the twists and turns\\, I enjoyed the comedy even though there was a lot more than there should have been. a must see","true":true}
