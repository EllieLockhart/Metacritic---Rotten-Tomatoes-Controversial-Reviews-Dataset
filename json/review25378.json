Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No need to rehash\\, it's just a terrible movie and retroactively torpedoed TFA as well. Made it impossible to recover the trilogy since all the remaining characters are one dimensional and non-compelling. Hopefully with time\\, Disney will sell the rights to the franchise\\, and this trilogy can be taken from canon and replaced with actual Star Wars movies in the Star Wars universe rather than knockoff Marvel trope with \\\"the force\\\".","true":true}
