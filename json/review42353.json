Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie totally destroyed the franchise. Not only did Rian Johnson completely ruin the character of Luke Skywalker\\, he ruined the story of the entire Skywalker family\\, which is the heart of the entire franchise. On top of that\\, it is just a badly made film with plot holes everywhere\\, no character development of Snoke before just getting rid of him\\, and the poor attempts at humor are B movie grade. Major disappointment and not worth the time or money. No point seeing the next episode since it all fell to crap.","true":true}
