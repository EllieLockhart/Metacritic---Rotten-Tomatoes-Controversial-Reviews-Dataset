Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a truly original installation into the Star Wars saga that subverted expectations constantly\\, added amazing elements to the mythology\\, introduces mature and balanced themes into this world\\, and is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. A few misses here and there in the subplots\\, but over all a great movie!","true":true}
