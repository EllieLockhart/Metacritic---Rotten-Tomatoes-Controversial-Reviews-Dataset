Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed with this. Script was so lazy and jokes were cringy or poorly timed. The only plus was the visuals but thats it. Overall the tone was all over the place. If you loved the original trilogy or even the prequels you're gonna be let down by this haphazard mess of a film. Keep your expectations very low going in. The conflict in this movie and the interactions between some key players all seems so forced it makes it uncomfortable to watch. The bad guys are so shallow that it feels like a cartoon. Maybe this could have been pulled off as an animated movie. Anyway this was literally the only reason I even created an account on rotten tomatoes. I had to express how much I felt let down by this movie.","true":true}
