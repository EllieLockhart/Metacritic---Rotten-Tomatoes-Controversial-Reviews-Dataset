Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really Disney? Is this the best you can do with the greatest saga of all time?\\nMaybe for casual sci-fi viewers this could be an interesting movie with nice visual effects and some good action scenes BUT if \\\"Star wars\\\" means something to you as it hugely means for me.. man\\, what a disappointing movie! The biggest \\\"fiasco\\\" I've seen in my life.\\n \\nI don\u00b4t see this movie being remembered for long time or having a 40 years special edition.\\n \\nWhat a great opportunity lost!","true":true}
