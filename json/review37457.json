Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"there are only two valid criticisms of this movie. only one of them has to do with the movie itself. the other one is really a collection of criticisms that can be made about the trilogy this movie is part of. both these criticisms are valid and deserve explanations or follow up in IX.\\n\\nother than that? this movie was phenomenal. 100%. no reservation. the best star wars movie\\, period.","true":true}
