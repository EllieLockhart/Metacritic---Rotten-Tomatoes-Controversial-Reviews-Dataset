Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has weaved an epic Star Wars film\\, complete with everything we've come to love about the series\\, and more... details that will  continue to make this move more watchable with time\\, and will lend themselves to the greater mythology of the series as a whole.","true":true}
