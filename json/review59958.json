We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Everything- the graphics\\, gameplay\\, sound\\, environment- is great. Even the story in principle isn't bad at all\\, just really poorly executed. For one right at the beginning you need to suspend logic and believe that Joel blindly trusted abby\\, that took me out of the game completely and it bugged me for the rest of it. Seems really implausible that someone so astute and always suspicious would make a mistake like that or change so much within a few years. I wasn't bothered as much by the fact that Joel died in that way(my first reaction was that it was expected\\, since the bad stuff he's done) as much as the uncharacteristic way they made him behave.Second\\, everything was waaay to long and also the narrative didn't seem sure of itself. A lot of it was just stupid filler that contributed nothing to the story and just made everything lose pace. I got bored several times and stopped for days. Third\\, the biggest problem- abby. There was NO reason to force us to play as this person for 10 hours. All that was needed was half an hour at most to explain her backstory and maybe an hour of gameplay to make us see that she had an angle. Instead they spend 10 hours trying to make us sympathise with her\\, failing with like 90% of the people who played the game. This character was not likeable and her motivations were not complex or difficult to understand\\, it wasn't that deep and didn't need so long. Understanding her motivations wasn't enough to care about her. If they'd made her gameplay like 75% shorter and allowed us to spend more time with Ellie this game would've been great. I think the ending was nice\\, the story if you ignore the horrendous way it was executed was also nice. Everything else about the game was nice. However I hated playing this- not because it made me feel bad or whatever\\, it was boring made me irritated that I was forced to keep playing as abby.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
