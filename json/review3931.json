Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring and lazy with more politics than three hours of C Span and worse jokes than Spaceballs.  I hear they are making another one in three years......I got a bad feeling about this.","true":true}
