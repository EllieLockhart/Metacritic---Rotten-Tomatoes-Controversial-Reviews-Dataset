Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointing movie...the story was not crafted well\\, the characters did not grow and it did not make The Force Awakens better\\, only made it worse. The sequel trilogy is on life-support after this movie.","true":true}
