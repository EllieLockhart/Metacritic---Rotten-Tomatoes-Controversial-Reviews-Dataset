Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment. So much wrong with it\\, can't be bothered to explain every single problem. \\n\\nBasically it's just 10 minutes of actual plot spread across two and a half hours of film. Nothing much story-wise actually happens. I could've left the cinema for an hour in the middle and not missed anything. \\n\\nAny interesting ideas left from The Force Awakens are either disposed of\\, or mocked. The entire Force Awakens buildup of searching for Luke across the galaxy is just pissed in the wind. Talk about an anticlimax! And it basically just lifts its ideas from Empire and ROTJ.\\n\\nPhasma is pointless\\, Finn does nothing\\, Chewie does nothing. Poe is just meh. Laura Dern\\, why?! 'Fish nun' creatures? \\n\\nCompletely misses the mark for me. I love Rian Johnson's previous work\\, don't think he was right for this at all.\\n\\n(It looked pretty\\, I'll give it that\\, the effect guys did great.)","true":true}
