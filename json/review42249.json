Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie stinks worse than wampa dung!  The comedy relief was better suited for Space Balls!  They pissed away an opportunity to showcase Luke Skywalker as legend.  My highschool drama club could have written a better screenplay!","true":true}
