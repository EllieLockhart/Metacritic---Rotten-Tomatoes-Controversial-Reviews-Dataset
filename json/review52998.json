Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan\\, my whole life- I was looking forward to seeing this movie and it was a massive disappointment. It was very obvious that there was not good communication between the directors and I don\u2019t understand any of the characters motivation. Why is Rey working so hard against the first order? Who is the first order? Why are they evil? What is there motivation? Are they just bad for some reason? Why didn\u2019t Admiral Holdo simply communicate her plan to Poe? The plot was awful. I don\u2019t think they could have made a worse movie. A Force Awakens set up some interesting plot points that The Last Jedi just threw away. I hope the franchise can recovery and make a better movie next time. -a disappointed fan","true":true}
