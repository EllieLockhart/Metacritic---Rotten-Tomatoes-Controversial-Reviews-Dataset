Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"May the forced subplots be with you. Watch TFA and then watch TLJ. There are serious and jarring tone\\, plot and character changes between the two movies. Having JJ do the entire trilogy would have been better. Where The Force Awakens borrows too much from previous movies\\, The Last Jedi goes WAY out of it's way to distance itself from beloved\\, well-established canon with an arrogance not seen since the Jedi council in the prequels. There were good parts - great parts\\, in fact - but the overall material was not good. Many of the storyline was poorly executed. There were some great visuals. We don't really see what Luke Skywalker was meant to be until the end\\, but his entire character was overtaken by an overzealous Mark Hamill being Mark Hamill. Having said that\\, I don't think it was his choice\\, as he mentioned early on that he disagreed with the direction for his character Easy to see why. JJ ABRAMS PLEASE SAVE THIS SERIES (with the next movie). You're our only hope!","true":true}
