Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not think that this film was poorly directed or made\\, the special effects\\, the camera work etc were all great. However the story\\, the plot holes\\, the SJW bullshit and the assassination of Luke Skywalker completely ruined it for me. Without going into too much detail this is what pissed me off:\\n- Luke throwing away this Father's lightsabre\\n- Luke and the titty milk\\n- Rebel Bombers LITERALLY dropping bombs... in space.\\n- One X-Wing taking on a Dreadnaught\\n- The entire casino subplot\\n- Rey beating Luke in a duel\\n- Luke thinking about murdering an unarmed child after everything he did to save his Father in the original trilogy\\n- Laura Dern not just telling everyone (including Poe) her plan\\n- The Hyperspeed Ramming Scene\\n- Leia flying through the air like Superman\\n- The retarded Astral Projection plot line\\n- Rose saving Finn from destroying the space-ram\\, literally making his character even more placeholder \/ useless\\n\\nThe sad thing is\\, there's probably more. Thanks for ruining my childhood Disney.","true":true}
