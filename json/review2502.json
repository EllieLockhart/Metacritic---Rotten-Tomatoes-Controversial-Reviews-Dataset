Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A visually impressive film which lacks heart and borderlines on abusive towards the pre-established characters and story lines (From both the original trilogy and the force awakens) Most of what JJ Abrams tried to do in the force awakens is discarded in this film for no more reason than to appear contrarian. The plot is plodding and too many irrelevant side stories which serve only to occupy characters who have nothing better to do.","true":true}
