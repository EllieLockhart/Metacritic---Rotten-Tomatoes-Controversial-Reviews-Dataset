Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals are top notch. Nothing really happens. It's like the movie Speed in space. No character development. A lot of sub-plots that didn't  fit in. The visuals and sound are  Really Really GOOD... I guess you could watch it on some kind a trip to get full appreciation. Glad my Ticket was free. Disappointed with the whole story. I think I'll skip EP9","true":true}
