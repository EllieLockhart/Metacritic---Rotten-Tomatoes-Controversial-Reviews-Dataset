Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw The Last Jedi\\,  I thought it was amazing the first time I saw it. The second time I saw the last Jedi I was seeing it with more critical eyes. The stuff with Finn and rose really didn't need to happen but then again the movie was about how all the characters had their failure moments. I loved the force Skype with Rey and Kylo Ren that was cool. \\nEven though I had a couple issues I didn't go full on butthurt about it. People need to STOP hating on star wars movies.  If you hate star wars so much there's the door\\,  don't let it hit you on the way out.","true":true}
