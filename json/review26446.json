Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now I know what some of y'all felt watching Episode I with Jar Jar Binks. Maybe I'm in a mood\\, but I didn't enjoy this movie. And it hurts my heart to admit that. The one thing I'll point to was it felt liked too many characters were doing too much in the quest to be a hero. Hopefully I'll appreciate it in later years. For now\\, it's just Meh.","true":true}
