Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not a bad movie. It's not great\\, but not bad. People make it out to be worse than it actually is. Pros: Luke\/Rey\/Kylo story is incredible\\, VFX are probably the best I've ever seen\\, amazing cinematography (nice\\, Johnson)\\, and most of the old actors give it their all (Leia\\, Luke\\, and even Yoda!). Cons: Boring second act involving Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rose. Rose is easily the worst character since Jar Jar. I won't complain about Holdo\\, her acting's pretty solid\\, but the character is way too untrustworthy. Other than that\\, I genuinely like this movie. Give it a watch\\, ignore what others say. Even me. You can make your own opinion. But\\, I think we should all hold judgement until Episode IX\\, when we will get answers for everything. Until then\\, I'm excited for the next journey in the galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
