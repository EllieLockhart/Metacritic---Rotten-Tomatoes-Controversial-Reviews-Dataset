Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even ignoring the destruction of the original trilogy characters\\, it was just a bad movie.  It jumped from one plot hole to the next\\, with a sloppy frenzy. Maybe if they keep the pace moving fast enough\\, you won't notice. Meanwhile\\, every 3D character is decimated and the 1D characters reign supreme.  Hell\\, they even put an end to it when the 1D characters started to get some depth.  Can't have that happen.  Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe - wasted opportunities.\\n\\nIt looked pretty and had lots of action.  Last time I checked\\, a good movie is supposed to tell a story and have some sort of character development.  This movie?  Nah.","true":true}
