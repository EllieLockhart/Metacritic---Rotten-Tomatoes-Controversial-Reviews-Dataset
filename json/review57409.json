Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment. I have been a star wars fan since i was a kid and inbmy opinion disney is ruining it. I relize that luke was not going to be the main star of the new trilogy but i can understand why he could not at least have a minor role in all of it. They not only kill him off but completely re write and betray his character. Also was it really necessary to see him milk an alien . i also want to know how princess leia could survive in space for so long then force push herself back to the ship. When the airlock is opened no one gets sucked out either. So much of it is completely unrealistic. Seems to me ray is just some mary sue character that can do anything without earning it through training of any kind. Luke gives her a few basic lessons and suddenly shes a super jedi. Seems like disneys pushing a bunch of feminism with these movies. Painting all the male characters in a negative light(including destroying lukes character) kylo ren as some unstable emo darth vader wannabe \\,  fin as a coward\\, and poe as some type of hot headed pilot whos judgement is clearly below all the female s . with so much emphasis on devirsity it all seems so forced and phoney. It literally turns my stomach to see what disney has done to one of the best made sagas of all time and totally ruined it. thanks alot. As long as they rake in there millions why will they giveba crap about true star wars fans.","true":true}
