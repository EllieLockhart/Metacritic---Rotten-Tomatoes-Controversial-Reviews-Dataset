Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not worth the wait. Being a Huge StarWars fan this movie was a gigantic disappointment. 1. Sith training was non existent 2. Did they really keep Leia alive for the sake of doing it. And how they did was even more ridiculous. 3. Same thing for Luke except reverse 4. I get the fury fox to be able to sell merchandise but really?? 5. StarWars was dark and violent not tailored to little children. ","true":true}
