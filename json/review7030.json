{"101487":117753,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars movie yet. *SPOILERS*\\n\\nThe thing is\\, casual moviegoers will likely enjoy this film. It looks great\\, visually\\, it might be the best in the franchise. But the plot was terrible -- did the bad guys really wait half the movie for the resistance to run out of petrol? Booooring.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens wasn't perfect\\, but it was a movie for the fans. By in large diehard Star Wars fans enjoyed it. The Last Jed is not. It's actually the opposite. Rian Johnson clearly tried to shock everyone by going against the grain\\, offering an edgy\\, darker film (even with the over-use of snappy one-liners and badly placed jokes and gags) then fans are used to. But with all the talking points and buildup from Force Awakens about Rey's heritage\\, who Snoke really is\\, etc. . . Disney and Johnson delivered NOTHING. All of the hype\\, talk\\, and buildup was for nothing. Rey is a nobody\\, which they could have told us from the beginning. I get that people other than Skywalkers can be powerful in the force\\, and that was the point they are trying to make. . . but it's stupid for two reasons: First\\, fans are well aware that many other non-Skywalker Jedis have been powerful in the force. Secondly\\, this entire franchise has revolved around the Skywalker family. Left as is\\, the last remaining Skywalker is Kyle Ren\\, a bad guy. There is no redemption there. The Skywalker family never brought balance to the force. Instead\\, the opposite is now true.\\n\\nThe fact that Rey and Kyle can Force mind text with each other while on opposite sides of the galaxy\\, seemed to suggest they were related.Personally\\, that is what I wanted to see happen. Again\\, nope. Rey is a nobody. . . a nobody\\, who\\, in fact\\, is more powerful in the force (without training) than Anikan Skywalker\\, the son of the force. That makes zero sense\\, and goes against everything George Lucas taught us.\\n\\nSo heading into this film\\, the two big questions were: Who is Rey\\, and who is Snoke? In the end\\, both are nobodies\\, and we know nothing about them. Snoke is dead. He isn't the bad guy J.J. Abrams and everyone else teased. He was a throwaway character. As for Luke\\, well\\, did he seriously toss his lightsaber--an item that has so much history--over his shoulder like it was junk mail? And he died because\\, in a nutshell\\, he used up all his force battery power by projecting himself across the galaxy as a hologram that can\\, apparently\\, fight Kylo Ren? What a dumb way for our hero to go out. Mark Hamill admitted in an early interview that he told Rian Johnson\\, after reading the script\\, that he \\\"fundamentally disagreed\\\" with everything about how Luke was portrayed. Well\\, Mark was right\\, Johnson and Disney destroyed the Luke Skywalker fans knew and loved.\\n\\nI suspect that Disney will be taken aback by all the negative feedback from fans and we'll learn in the next movie that Rey is actually someone special. . . probably a Skywalker. We'll see.\\n\\nPeople arguing that the prequels are bad too\\, it's not the same. Lucas' first three moves are brilliant. Those are canon\\, and nothing that happened before them -- because there was no Luke and we knew where the story would ultimately end up -- could ruin the original films. Rian Johnson\\, on the other hand\\, is taking the characters millions of people love\\, and has changed them for the worse.\\n\\nI'm devastated\\, as a fan\\, to have hated this movie\\, but in the end\\, it's an absolute trainwreck. Making movies for the fans should be a no-brainer. That's the best way to make money and keep fans begging for more. Count me among those who have no plans to watch Episode IX\\, and who cannot believe that Rian Johnson was chosen to develop the next trilogy.\\n\\nRIP Star Wars\\, it was fun while it lasted. I sure hope J.J. Abrams can save this. . . but I'm not holding out hope.","true":true}
