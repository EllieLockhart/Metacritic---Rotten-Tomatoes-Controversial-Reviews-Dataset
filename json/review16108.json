Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm done with Star wars... Disney threw all the logic out of the window to sell some good looking popcorn scenes with no substance at all.\\nPlot holes everywhere and 0 consequences in the whole movie. The last Jedi is on the same level as The phantom menace.","true":true}
