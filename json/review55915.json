Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson crapped all over the Star Wars franchise and made a piece of trash. The movie is horrible. I like how he brought back JarJarBinks with #BenicioBinks. Even worse\\, reminiscent of 30 mins of wasted film with the pod-racing of The Phantom Menace... 30 mins of wasted film with dear-horse racing through a casino. Yeah\\, what a giant waste of time that was. Finn and Rose apparently are indestructible. Rian Johnson should lose his job as a director after the junk he wrote and directed with The Last Jedi. Really.. a 'your-mom' joke?! I had such high hopes for this movie after The Force Awakens\\, but Rian Johnson... you suck as a movie writer and as a director. You ruined this movie and have scarred a huge franchise.\\n\\nIt was bad enough what George Lucas had done with Episodes 1\\,2\\,3. Holy crap those were bad. Then you get a little hope with the Force Awakens and JJ Abrams. Then.. the Dark Side settles upon the Rebellion in the name of: Darth Rian Johnson...","true":true}
