Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe that the critics werent paid off for their reviews.  RJ is an a** for treating a legendary character like Luke the way he did.  Gone is the mighty warrior who is now reduced to an angry old get off my lawn recluse.  The effects were grand but the story is a flop.  I dont think the trilogy can be salvaged.  What a shame!!! Now the force is really a joke that can let people tele-skype to each other and fight ghost battles and fly through space after being struck by a missle.  PC\\, feminism galore\\, damn 1% people\\, arms dealers dealing to both sides\\, unneccesary characters taking up the whole film\\, and a fleet of star destroyers that have to wait until a ship runs out of fuel to blow it up!!! NONSENSE.   The prank call in the beginning should have let me know what was in store.  DISGUSTED!!!!","true":true}
