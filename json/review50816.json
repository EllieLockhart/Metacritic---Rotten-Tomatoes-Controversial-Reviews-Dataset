Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A big steaming pile of garbage and an insult to the original trilogy. I had high hopes going in\\, especially after how good Rogue One was\\, but this has sucked the soul out of the franchise for me. It's as if the director hated Star Wars and decided to use this movie as a soap box to say f you to both the fans and the original films. From the treatment of Luke's character\\, to the unceremonious killing of Snoke\\, to the lackluster reveal of Rey's parents\\, to the practically overt PC agenda that dominates the entire story\\, this movie goes out of its way to tear down everything it's been building up. Not just in regards to the current trilogy\\, but the previous ones as well. What a waste. I've been a diehard Star Wars fan for just shy of 30 years\\, but unless Disney decides to do an about face (not likely)\\, I'm done with this franchise.","true":true}
