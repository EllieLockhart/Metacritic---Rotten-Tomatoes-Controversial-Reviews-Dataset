Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a really good movie and interesting twists with really strong performances. One weaker sequence at kanto bite doesn't really seem to fit in with the movie but still entertaining and does not ruin the film for me. Many hardcore star wars fans could have an issue with some of the choices that were made but i think it was the right way. Overall the last jedi ranks as one of the best star wars film to date.","true":true}
