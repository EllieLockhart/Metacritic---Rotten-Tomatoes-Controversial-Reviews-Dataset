Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was quite possibly the biggest disappointment of my life. I put myself through the horror of watching it twice\\, just so I could be sure I wasn't being overly melodramatic. \\n\\nTFA's second half comes off looking better after this clusterfck. I will not deny that it has impressive visuals and with the exception of the space battle\\, the visual direction is more than competent. That probably deserves more than a half-star but I find it impossible to do so. \\n\\nI swear\\, even the entire ridiculous plot I could ignore\\, not to mention the blatant sexism against the new female characters by showing them off as failures (Holdo\\, Rose\\, even Leia\\, anyone?) or unrealistic expectations put on women by the sheer existence of Rey\\, yes even the blatant abuse Finn and Poe suffer\\, but the character assassination of Luke Skywalker is not something that can be ignored. The guy who sees good in Darth Vader\\, mass murderer\\, would kill his own nephew because he sensed darkness in him? Please. \\n\\nMy hatred knows no bounds for the idiots who let Abrams and Johnson blunder into such a forest fire that turned every achievement of the Original Trilogy to ashes. I can't believe this received so many good reviews from critics and I am further disgusted after having read some of them.","true":true}
