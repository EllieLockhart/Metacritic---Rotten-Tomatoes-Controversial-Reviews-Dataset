Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest mistake Disney made with this movie is turning it over to Rian Johnson.  I thought JJ Abrams had a pretty solid story in The Force Awakens\\, so why didn't the leave this with him?  Rian Johnson crapped all over the Star Wars universe\\, killed off some of the best characters left and gave us really annoying new characters.  Worst of all\\, he left us the image of Leia Poppins that I can't get out of my head.  Thanks for that.","true":true}
