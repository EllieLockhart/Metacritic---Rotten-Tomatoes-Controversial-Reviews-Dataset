Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not getting the hate.  With Force Awakens it was \\\"this is too derivative\\\".  Now\\, it's become \\\"it doesn't pay respect to the originals\\\".  If I didn't know better\\, I would say this seems to be a massive troll campaign.  Anyways\\, the movie was excellent barring one plot drain mid-way through.  Otherwise\\, it was great.  I can understand fans being upset that they got all worked up over several \\\"theories\\\" only to have most if not all shrugged off by th end.  To that I say\\, \\\"your arrogance is your weakness.\\\"\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is vastly superior to the prequels\\, and loads better than Force Awakens.  As for those screaming for Lucas to return\\, remember that's the guy who gave you Jar Jar Binks and the empire being defeated by teddy bears.","true":true}
