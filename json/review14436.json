Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I HAD TO CHANGE MY RATING FROM 1\/2 STAR TO ONE STAR BECAUSE ROTTEN  TOMATOS DOES NOT FACTOR 1\/2 RATINGS INTO THE PERCENTAGE. An 18 hr slow chase with light speed capable ships?  The FO could have sent or called a couple of ships to flank them\\, this made no sense.  Since the whole movie occurs over this time period it's a waste as well.  Correct these two things and by god correct what RJ did to Luke and you would almost have had a decent movie. In the end instead of adding to an iconic story RJ alienates 25-50% of the hard core fans with a story so boring that it fails to bring in new fans to replace them.  That is what is wrong with this movie\\, this story and why it is the Last Star Wars film I will probably watch under Disney's direction.","true":true}
