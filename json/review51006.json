Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely amazing. So much story it felt like the Lord of the Rings from the standpoint of hopping around to 10 different equally engaging threads of stories. I can not wait for the next episode. Well done Rian Johnson\\, you deserve a 10 year contract on all upcoming Star Wars movies. ","true":true}
