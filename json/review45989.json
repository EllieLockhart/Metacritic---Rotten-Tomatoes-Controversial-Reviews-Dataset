Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive\\, that's it... Otherwise\\, suffers story-wise from various plot holes\\, useless characters\\, terrible character development\\, inconsistent with established lore\\, and most obvious intent to humiliate and ruin Luke Skywalker\\, the enduring hero of the original trilogy.  Truly disappointing and hard to watch how an iconic hero is butchered to make way for the new characters\\, just pitiful.  RIP Star Wars...","true":true}
