Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I was asked if I liked the film the best response I could come up with was: \\\"Is it possible to like a film but hate every detail about it?\\\"  I was visually entertained.  That's about it.  Unfortunately I can't just sit and watch mindlessly and as soon as I started to think about the things that were going on my enjoyment would plummet.  I always thought Star Wars was about good stories.  This film broke the narrative and led every set up from the previous film to a dead end.","true":true}
