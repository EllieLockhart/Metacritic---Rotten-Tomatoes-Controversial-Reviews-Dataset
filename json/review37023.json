Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was visually very good\\, but this was not enough to make it \\\"a good Star Wars movie\\\"\\, nor make up for the awful storyline and abundant plot holes. Not to mention ruined characters both new and old. I don't hate this movie but it as just as bad or possibly worse than The Force Awakens. Thanks for ruining Luke Skywalker. You killed off one of the best characters and hurt your profits but you will not kill off the fandom\\, Disney. We will just tune you out and pretend your awful movies (except Rogue One) don't exist.","true":true}
