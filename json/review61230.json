If all of our favorite characters names changed\\, you wouldn\u2019t even notice it was supposed to be Ellie or Joel. Everyone acted VERY out of character. And not the \u201coh she just grew up\u201d way. I never felt a connection to the new characters as much as I did try. Naughty Dog made a character that was so obvious you were supposed to sympathize for. But it was so FORCED! Unlike the first one which was organic. In the first game\\, I didn\u2019t even notice how attached to Joel I was until he he got severely hurt. I was surprised. I couldn\u2019t get that spark back this time around. The story was highly disappointing and all over the place. This is just my personal opinion\\, but it was too long. I\u2019m a slow gamer as it is\\, and this game took forever. You can tell there is a message being pushed. Whether or not you like the message I believe is a personal decision every individual has the right to make. And for those who do not like the message should not be condemned. Especially when it so upfront and obvious. On the positive side\\, like everyone clearly praises\\, it\u2019s graphics are amazing. I was surprised I was playing a PS4 game. A lot of effort was put into graphics and it shows. Gameplay is familiar. Still good and easy to learn like the first one. And my oh my\\, can you customize the settings. That is nice for people who really like to control their game flow.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
