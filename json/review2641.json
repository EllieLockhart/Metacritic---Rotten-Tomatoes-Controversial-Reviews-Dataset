Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie\\, really took the franchise in a new direction that will help clear up some of issues with the prequels (specifically the force and th Jedi) with out spoiling too much Rey and Kylo are now in a position to reinvent both sides of the force outside the theistic cults the Jedi and Sith had begun\\, the resistance is in the ropes and can't wait to see how they pull themselves back\\, and even though one character met they're \\\"end\\\" anyone who's seen Star Wars knows they'll be back in the next one. Anyone complaining is just mad that it didn't follow whatever fanfic theory they already convinced themselves of...or is a massive fan of the prequels\\, in my opinion this is how I alway thought Star Wars would continue after Return of the Jedi","true":true}
