Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm posting this review just because JJ apparently has to habitually deflect criticism of the film by saying people are threatened by women.  The film just wasn't good JJ; admit it.  Creative advice for XI:  leave politics out of it and do a better job of portraying female characters; don't make them weak and petty characters.  RIP Carrie","true":true}
