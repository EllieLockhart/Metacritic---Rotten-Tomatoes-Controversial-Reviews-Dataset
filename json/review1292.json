Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really entertaining movie but poorly written.  Luke becomes a hermit and just gives up?  Not  happening!  Would not pay to see it twice\\,  Left too many questions unanswered.   It could have been soo much more but Disney ruined it and went away from the story line","true":true}
