Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disappointment\\, the force awakens built up so much mystery about the characters but sadly this one just was under underwhelming executed story wise.  Sure its pretty\\, but come on you mean to tell me that lucasfilms and Disney in all thier might cant have a proper writers to delivery the narrative wise than this half-assed  job of a story?","true":true}
