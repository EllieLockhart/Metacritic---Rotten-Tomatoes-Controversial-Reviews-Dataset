Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd never thought I'd see the day where I held another Star wars movie below 1-3 but by god TLJ has pulled it off thanks to who really knows at disney. There are slight sheds of the feminist undertones with the Purple haired admiral and Poe debacle but oh how I wish that were the only thing to point out as a con. Firstly Rey didn't get further developed if anything she has taken two steps back in the \\\"how can she be so powerful\\\" line of questioning. Rather than give her adequate screen time to train and better herself she eventually bests even Luke in a small bout\\, brilliant writing no explanation\\, she just IS this powerful no training necessary. Daisy Riddley in an interview had the audacity in an interview when asked \\\"how is rey so powerful?\\\" to simply say \\\"she just is\\, she's a bad ass\\\" or something along the lines of that...Excellent writing totally squashed the mary sue allegations with that one Disney (not at all). Beyond that they made horrible decisions moving forward with the series what with carrie Fishers' tragic passing. Instead of\\, when actually having a dramatic moment for her to pass on\\, NOPE SHE'S GOT THE FORCE. Just...genius pure genius\\, wouldn't want to write her character out beforehand so episode 9 isn't starting with a CGI Carrie fisher getting killed off or worse yet have her pass away off screen and not explain it\\, or show it. They have just written themselves into an awful no win situation\\, not entirely their fault but a wall which must be passed eventually. Then there is the abomination of a sub plot that is the casino events. Ohhhh what a nice touch of anti-capitalist sentiment from one of the most thriving capitalist monopolies. Agendas aside the plot itself could've been saved had Finn just talked to the proper man that Maz had told them about instead of trusting the most obviously shady character probably ever to appear in star wars. Better yet they might not have ever had to go to the casino in the first place had the purple haired admiral ACTUALLY divulged her plans to Poe or anyone else for that matter\\, but no she tells no one when EVERYONE is dying and worried for their lives that she actually has a somewhat decent plan. And if hyperspace ships can destroy a whole fleet why didnt they evacuate a ship and have someone sacrifice their ship from the beginning? That's more hypothetical sure but definitely raised some questions as did many things in this movie. Why the hell is Luke milking a space walrus? the world will never know. I could go on but I must say\\, for me at least\\, the real final nail in the coffin was the brutally unaware humor that was scattered about the film at possibly the worst moments. I felt ashamed for laughing at times\\, at what was just some simple unexpected slapstick\\, OR THE OPENING SCENE of Poe staring down an entire dreadnought to make a \\\"your mother\\\" joke to Hux\\, who then hilariously enough\\, gets force dragged across the floor humiliating him in front of all his subordinates\\, just another brilliant choice really...and by brilliant I mean awful\\, just like the entire movie.\\n\\nI will say the fight scene with Rey and Kylo was well done though\\, but even then you'll notice Rey bests MORE guards than kylo and with seemingly greater ease\\, so even in the movies shining scene the worst parts of her character break through. \\nI wanted this to be good\\, as I am sure we all did but disney needs to let directors do as they wish and stop controlling every aspect of these films.","true":true}
