Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing and direction of this movie was crap. There were many scenes that seemed forced and completely unnecessary. The whole casino scene was terrible . The whole chase scene felt like forced drama. The first order could have just had a ship jump to light speed ahead of the shop then jump back and have them surrounded. They killed off the big bad baddy half way through the movie with out giving any information about him. Finally the writers completely and utterly destroid Luke Skywalker. Gorge Lukas stated that the Star Wars movies were about the skywalkers which i always hoped Disney would continue. Ya know since the creator of the entire story said so. I understand the whole message of this movie is let the past die and all that\\, but they didn't have to completely change Luke's character in the process. This is Grand Master Luke Skywalker we are talking about here. His unweavering loyalty and love for others and his family would never allow him to let the galaxy to fall into another war without trying to help. He would NEVER think about KILLING HIS NEFEW! Jesus Christ that is his sisters and best friends kid for god sake. This movie is complete and utter garbage. For those who call themselves \\\"die hard\\\" fans but still liked this movie\\, I have one thing to say to you. This is how Star Wars dies. With thunderous applause.","true":true}
