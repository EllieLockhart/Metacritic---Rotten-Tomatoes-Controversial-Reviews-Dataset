Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disgrace to fans of George Lucas' films. JJ Abrams beautifully set up what could have been a great story\\, but what we get here is a movie that seems to ignore or destroy every interesting plot point from Force Awakens. Princess Leia flying through space was the stupidest thing ever put into a movie. There are scenes that defy basic physics and rules already laid out in the star wars universe like inventing new force powers and making a new version of Luke Skywalker that's nothing like the Luke we all know. I can't imagine anyone is happy with the way they handled the end of the skywalker family. Just terrible\\, they should scrap and remake with someone who actually cares about star wars.","true":true}
