The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Like many others\\, I have been waiting for this game for many years and now\\, the long-awaited release took place. I bought the game and for a couple of weeks I was immersed in it. I have never seen such intensity of drama in any other game. Emotions are torn over the place\\, the game makes you suffer and experience everything that happens in it. At the end\\, I felt depression\\, sadness and hopelessness ... It's just amazing! I\u2019m so tired of all these \\\"super heroes\\\"\\, \\\"happy ends\\\" and boring stories! I have got many thoughts after passing\u2026 many questions for my own life ... When the credits began\\, I just got up\\, went to my daughter\\, hugged her and sat like that for some time ...\rI absolutely cannot understand all this crazy hatred around the game. Indeed\\, there is a lot of unnecessary feminism\\, many LGBT feature stories. Why is \u201ctransgender\u201d needed here? Why all the main and strong characters (except Joel) are women? In the WLF camp you can hear a conversation of random people about the love of two guys (this moment can be easily miss)\\, what is it for? Many of these things just made it difficult for me to empathize with some of the characters. I am not against LGBT\\, but sometimes there is too much of it! Why couldn't it be done like in the first part of the game? There were strong men and women; it was harmoniously incorporated into the game's plot. I believed in role-playing of Bill\\, Tess\\, Marlene! But Lev's motivation eluded me... Either he is a girl\\, but wants to be a boy\\, or he \/ she is fighting against the patriarchy in the village\\, or he \/ she simply did not want to marry this man??? What should I empathize with here? Why is this? To please someone or try to take advantage of current \u201cLGBT-trends\u201d? It's superfluous\\, but it does NOT make the game a bad! I understand Ellie's motivation\\, I understand Abby. I both love and hate them at the same time. I DON'T want to fight when they fight each other\\, neither in the theater or at the end of the game! They don't know each other's history\\, they don't know each other's feelings\u2026 I would like to shout\\, \\\"STOP!\\\". But the game\\, like in the life\\, continues its story in cold blood. Where has it been in video games? NOWHERE!\rI would give the game a \\\"9\\\" due to the overabundance of LGBT stories\\, but the game deserves a better rating (which was greatly spoiled by those who put a \\\"0\\\" (perhaps they not even played the game)). The game is EXCELLENT!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
