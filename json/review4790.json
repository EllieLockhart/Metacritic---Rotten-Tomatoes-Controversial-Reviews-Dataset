Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely turned around all expectations\\, story-wise\\, for this movie. It's not your typical Star Wars experience\\, but nonetheless an interesting and captivating one. Had a few weak plotlines\\, but overall all parts of the film had it's purposes to the satisfying ending.","true":true}
