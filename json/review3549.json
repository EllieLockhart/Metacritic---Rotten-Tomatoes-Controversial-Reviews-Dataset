Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star wars movie ever! There is a lot of memorabe scenes (Like the amazing final part) and some great plot twists! I dont see why many people dislike it. Definetly go watch it if you want to watch a amazing star wars movie!","true":true}
