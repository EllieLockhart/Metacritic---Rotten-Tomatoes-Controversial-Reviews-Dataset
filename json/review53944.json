{"101487":129485,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am happy I didn't see this movie in theatres but still disappointed in shelling out 20 dollars to stream it on PSN network. There is little else to say than this is a very bad movie. I loved (past tense) Star Wars. This has finally made me reconsider the legacy of the franchise. As other have so correctly pointed out... the plot to the movie is like an episode of family guy. There is little connection or depth to anything the characters have to say or any reverence at all to Jedi lore. Hell the word Jedi is in the title yet there is no information given about any of its core characters and their connection to the force. The script is utter nonsense with convoluted conversations about space gas and light speed all the while not explaining anything about who or where or why I should care about any of the characters. The writers were more interested in writing humor that made me wanna barf. It was hard to finish the movie. I'm sorry but Star Wars is dead. I'm sorry Luke but they butchered you too. Good bye Star Wars. And FU Disney","true":true}
