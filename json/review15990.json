Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a die hard fan os Star Wars for almost 30 years and this one I enjoyed watching very much. It was fun like other star wars movies\\, yet it was different and unexpected. This movie doesn't deserve all the extreme negative reactions just because it wasn't what people expected. I would rate it with 4 of 5 stars\\, but to counter all the negative ratings based on people's frustrations I gave it 5.","true":true}
