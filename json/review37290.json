Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The \\\"plot\\\" for episode 8 was a metaphor for how the\\, ahem\\, creative team must have felt about the Skywalker saga\\, so they felt that gave them carte blanche to crap all over and destroy everything that came first.  What pompous asses.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy are literally worse than Hitler.  Hitler did a bunch of horrible things\\, but he never ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
