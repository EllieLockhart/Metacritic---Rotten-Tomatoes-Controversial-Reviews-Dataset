Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Interesting to see all the bot reviews trying to drive down the score... Pretty funny really.. Here\u2019s a real review... The movie is far from perfect but it\u2019s still the 2nd best Star Wars movie ever.. It has a powerful message at it\u2019s core..THE FORCE LIVES IN EVERYONE.. You decide your own path! CHEERS","true":true}
