Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. Youhad nice concept art\\, an interesting  2-characters developement and what do you do? Fill the movie with SJW bullshit and low level morality (the whole Casino planet was cringy and painfull to watch). I'm not watching the next episode","true":true}
