Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi picks up where Force Awakens left off. Or a few moments before that. It picks up all the plot points from the previous film. Then\\, it places them in a blender for a few minutes\\, sets them on fire\\, throws the ashes down a ravine\\, then urinates and defecates all over them... To its credit\\, that was a remarkable aim. \\n\\nThe plot is all over the place. Pacing is a nightmare. Characters reacting to terrible news are lost to a cut away to something else. The humour is awful... just\\, awful! They have tried too hard to make Finn\\, relatable. Rather than feeling like a character in star wars who happens to have black skin\\, he feels like a token-black character from a sitcom\\, who's just been thrown into that galaxy far\\, far away. He doesn't feel like he belongs there. But then again\\, most of the characters just feel a bit off for this franchise. I think it's all bad writing.\\n\\nThe message of the movie is that\\, \\\"Sacrificing yourself heroically to save others\\\" is silly\\, unless you're a woman with zero leadership or hairstyle-selecting skills.\\n\\nStar Wars was never about \\\"letting the past die\\\"\\, and especially not \\\"killing it\\, if you have to\\\"! Star Wars is about making history. Building epic stories and characters that will LIVE ON\\, through the ages\\, just as Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia did from the original trilogy.\\n\\nI saw this at the cinemas using a voucher that was about to expire... I still regret that decision. I was bored when Canto Bight began. Soon after\\, I was wondering when I would be able to go home to my warm bed. Later still\\, I had already learned to accept this movie for the hover-train wreck that was. Nothing about the ending surprised me. I felt nothing\\, and will continue to feel nothing. The Star Wars franchise is dead to me\\, and I accept that.\\n\\nAll that being said\\, I seriously wish that PORGS WERE REAL!!! (They would make the best slippers. Alas\\, I have big feet. So I would need to kill at least ten of them)","true":true}
