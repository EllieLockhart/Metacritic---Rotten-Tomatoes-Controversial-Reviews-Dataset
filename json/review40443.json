Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the direction the series needs to be heading. The film is filled with amazing ideas and characters. Absolutely love this new trilogy. A lot of people said this is the best since Empire Strikes Back but after a few more watches I may find this to be even superior!","true":true}
