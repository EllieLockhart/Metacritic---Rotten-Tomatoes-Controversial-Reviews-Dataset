Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The First Order continue to track down the resistance\\, yet things certainly get unexpected toward the end and a big change occurs for both the Resistance and the First Order. I personally thought this was better than Episode VII in many ways. The story is a bit all over the place and a bit too long like most people have said\\, but it was still more unexpected than what Episode VII offered. I honestly liked the moments that didn't feel much like \\\"Star Wars\\\" moments (like the gambling planet scenes) because of how different they felt.  Character development could maybe have been better\\, but to me it wasn't all that different compared to VII's development. Overall another decent\\, but not excellent\\, Star Wars film.","true":true}
