Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gawd awful mess of a movie. By far the worst Star Wars movie\\, ever! Feels more like a parody of Star Wars than an addition to the story. Guts a lot of what was done in episode 7.  Don't waste your time.","true":true}
