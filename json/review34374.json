Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bar has been lowered so far in the Star Wars series that merely completing a movie gets you two stars. I don't know why it's so hard to create a complete sci fi story in the SW series without it feeling clunky and disjointed. If this did not have any competition\\, and you did not know how a better movie could be made\\, this would clearly be a 4 or 4.5 Star movie\\, but better sci fi movies are made\\, monthly. This may be the best SW movie yet\\, but it falls so short of potential by clinging to its tired old elements. I paid too much in the theater. It wasn't worth the $12 ticket.","true":true}
