Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is every chance\\, that on repeat viewings\\, this will pass Empire Strikes Back as my favourite AND the best Star Wars film.  We'll see\\, but it had layers\\, some great performances and was a hell of a lot of fun.\\n\\nWherever it ends up\\, it's a very good film and Carrie Fisher (R.I.P.)  \\, she went in style. \\n\\nGreat film.
