Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a different story to what everyone was expecting. The acting of the whole cast was just amazing\\, I didn't really find any part of the film boring\\, and the development of kylo ren makes me feel sorry for his character after having killed Han Solo\\, just an amazing performance from all the cast and an amazing move from Rian Johnson","true":true}
