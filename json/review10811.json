Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hard to believe that the prequels could be out done in terms of being absolute disappointments\\, but I guess we'll need to pass the distinction of having directed the very worst installment of the Star Wars franchise to Rian Johnson now!  Total and complete ruination of the story and it's key characters in the mere span of 2 1\/2 painful hours.  If I could give this effort a ZERO I would have\\, it's complete tripe.","true":true}
