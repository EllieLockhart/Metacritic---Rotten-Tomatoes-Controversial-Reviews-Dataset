Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and this was a great movie. I just wish it was more. I wanted to know more about Snoke and to understand his knowledge about the force. Overall I loved the movie and would watch it again.","true":true}
