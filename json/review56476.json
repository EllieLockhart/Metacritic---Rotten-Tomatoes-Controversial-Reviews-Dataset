Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is entertaining to watch\\, it has back and forths that keep you hooked with some unexpected twists and an interesting psychological duel between the dark and the light side.\\n\\nDespite it's virtues the movie sins in some critical aspects\\, but specially in the history's congruence. Many plot holes are poorly addressed or left unresolved. Snoke\\, the main villain is not developed hence making it a weak villain for an 8th chapter of the franchise.  \\nAnother flaw lies within the choice of the plot lines within the film\\, the story line of Finn and Rose (the asian girl) is an hour of pointless so called \\\"adventure\\\"\\, that is anything but useful to the development of the plot. \\n\\nFinally I personally feel that the way Luke Skywalker was portrayed in this movie is beyond believable\\, the director in the search of \\\"everything is possible in this universe\\\" ends up forcing his own agenda while insulting the fan base of the original movies.\\n\\nThe movie is fun to watch but the flaws are plot holes are everywhere.","true":true}
