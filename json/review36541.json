Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie for the fans leaves to be desired with a narrative that escapes of the \\\"standard\\\" star wars\\, bringing an ignorant Luke and that seems that it has not learned nothing during all this time\\, the personages are well taken advantage of or as in the case of Luke negatively\\, but at the same time the film is visually beautiful and manages to bring the graphic essence of star wars as well as the perfect execution of the soundtrack of the master John Williams.","true":true}
