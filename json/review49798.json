Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yep I liked it. Thought it was outstanding. The 2nd time I saw it was even better. There were a lot of details I missed because I was blown away. But this review is about the fans crying foul. I appreciate your bitterness and your tears because Luke didn't do what you wanted or acted the way you wanted. Snoke's final scene was great and unexpected. Do I need to know his background? Nope not important. So go check out Wookiepedia for some worthless facts. You're mad at Ren? I saw growth and a great set up for the third movie. I'm impressed with the ire towards this movie. Just wondering how many of you EU clingers wrote a few dozen hater reviews? The best part is 99% of the haters will be in line for IX.","true":true}
