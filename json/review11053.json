Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here is how I know I didn't like this movie.  When I left the theather I felt stunned and numb.  The more I think about it\\, the more I grow to hate it. On the ride home\\, by husband and I\\, both huge Star Wars nerds\\, didn't talk about the plot or the new characters or what we think will happen in the next movie.  Instead we talked about what we didn't like.  Neither of us liked any of the new characters or the jokes.  We really didn't like the one scene with Leia (no spoilers).   And we REALLY didn't like how Luke was portrayed.  After we peeled away what we didn't like\\, there wasn't anything left.  I am having a hard time finding 1 thing I can say that was good about this movie.  I guess Rey and the music.  That's about it.","true":true}
