Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic\\, if imperfect\\, Star Wars movie. In my opinion the negativity is overblown and hyperbolic. It has warts for sure\\, a few scenes are definitely  odd or fall flat\\, and IMHO it was longer than it needed to be. Some of the side-plots dragged in the middle of the film.\\n\\nBut overall: it delivered amazing action\\, great emotional\/character moments and some real surprises. Kylo in particular stands out as a great character terrifically acted here. \\n\\nSo again: not perfect\\, but not even remotely a 0 - 1 star movie.","true":true}
