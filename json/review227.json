This game does a great job of engrossing you into the story from the first 30 minutes to the ending. The story is one of the best I have experienced in a while and I feel is the best part of the game. The 3 parts of this game are the story\\, the main brawling gameplay\\, and the massive amount of minigames. TheAs a newcomer to Yakuza I must say that this has been a great experience.

The minigames are wacky and fun and act as a great diversion to the serious main story and compliment the game very well\\, my only issue is that along the main story you are forced to do most of these minigames at least once which at some points when i wanted to just get to the next piece of story were quite annoying. My main problem with Yakuza 0 is the brawling main gameplay. The fighting system in this game is satisfying and very fun at first\\, with multiple styles and upgrades. The issue comes in when you are 30 hours in and each segment of fighting takes forever and you are spamming cheap moves just to get to the next piece of story. By the end it gets old and you will be doing TONS of it. Besides the repetitive combat this game was very enjoyable to play and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good stories or enjoys having lots of variety of side content.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
