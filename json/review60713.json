My biggest problem with this game was the story. The first game's story was super emotional\\, devastating\\, and beautiful\\, all at the same time. This game...was not. The entire course of the game\\, I felt very disturbed. The game is dark\\, more so than the first. Do not get me wrong\\, I do not mind if games are dark if they're pulled off well\\, but this game was not. I can't describe it without getting into spoiler territory\\, but the story to this game actually made me feel really depressed. The pacing of the story was weird\\, and the plot twists were executed very poorly. I felt like the gameplay and upgrading was superior to the first one\\, but it got repetitive. The amount of times I felt like I needed to be stealthy got very old. Enemy A.I. felt very inconsistent\\, and stealth encounters were at times very easy\\, and other times\\, weirdly hard. Many of the characters from the original game were ruined for me\\, and I was not a fan of many of the new characters.\r\rFor some positives\\, I will say that visuals are breathtaking. Some of the best I have ever seen in a video game\\, actually. There was also one level in the game that was open world-ish\\, and I wish there would have been more sections like this\\, because it was done very well. The voice-acting also felt professional and very well done.\r\rOverall\\, as a video game\\, this game is pretty good. I was able to finish it\\, and as somebody who has a huge backlog of games I've started\\, but never finished\\, that's an impressive feat for a 20 hour game. However\\, as a sequel to the one of the most beloved games I've ever played\\, I was very disappointed with the direction Naughty Dog chose to go for this game. If you are a fan of the original Last of Us\\, approach this game with caution. I would recommend at least one playthrough\\, but do not go in expecting this game to be like the first\\, because it's not.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
