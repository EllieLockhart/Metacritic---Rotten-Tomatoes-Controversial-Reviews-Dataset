Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Professional Critics are clearly paid off to give such a high rating.  This movie is full of plot holes and inconsistencies.  Worst of all\\, ALL of the main characters are brain dead idiots making unthinkable decisions that gets pretty much everyone killed.\\n\\nThis is not a star wars movie.  This is a pile of trash.  I won't be going to the theatres any more to see any new star wars movies.","true":true}
