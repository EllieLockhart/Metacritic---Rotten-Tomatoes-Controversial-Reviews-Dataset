Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was everything I had hoped it would be. Full of interesting twists and the best fight sequence in Star Wars history\\, it is fully deserving of these five stars. I could feel physical tension throughout the film\\, and it truly makes you begin to question the morals of both the light and dark. I absolutely loved it.","true":true}
