Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to tell that I'm not an avid fan of the saga but I've watched most of the previous movies and this one encouraged me more than ever to follow every Star Wars movie ever made. \\n\\nNow\\, about the movie. The role of Luke here is the light that can be used as path for the new Jedi even when the hope seems to be lost\\, I understood the message and almost made me cry. \\nObviously our beloved Princess Leia was remembered as the fighter and leader that she is. Rest In Peace Princess Leia may the force be with you forever","true":true}
