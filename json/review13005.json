Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't even know where to begin\\, but I feel like Rian owes every Star Wars fan a refund\\, an apology\\, and his resignation from the \\\"trilogy\\\" he was handed for the worst movie since Phantom Menace. He's a decent director\\, but clearly a terrible writer.","true":true}
