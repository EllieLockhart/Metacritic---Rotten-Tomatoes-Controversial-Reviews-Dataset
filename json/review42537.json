Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was\\, and is\\, an absolute disgrace. I give it a half star because at lease the film looked good. \\n\\nI can forgive many of this movies shortcomings\\, but when the entire movie is based on a miscommunication between characters my immersion is broken. I came to watch a star wars film\\, not a gilmore girls episode.","true":true}
