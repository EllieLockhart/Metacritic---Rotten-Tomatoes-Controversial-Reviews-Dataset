Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So when reviewing this movie I had to break it down into 3 parts-Finn\/Rose\\, Poe\/Holdo\\, Rey\/Ren\\n1)Finn Rose-0.5\/5\\, it didnt bring anything to the story\\n2)Poe\/Holdo-3\/5\\, Poe was great like the last movie and the parts with Leia were really good. I just didnt understand why Holdo couln't tell Poe the plan?\\n3)Rey\/Ren- 4.5\/5 easily the best part of the movie. Wish they would of went into more detail with Snoke and what happened at the Jedi Temple.\\n\\nAlso Luke\\, Leia and Yoda were great. I don't understand the people saying this movie is worse than Episode II. Yes there were a few holes and bad parts but it is still a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
