Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing is the best I can say. Plot holes and weak characters surround this film and leave the viewer with so many questions un-answered the only question I now ask is why I wasted my time with this at all. If you are a casual viewer that has not grown up on this movie franchise then I am sure you will love it. But if you value the Star Wars saga at all\\, this movie is the biggest let down ever.","true":true}
