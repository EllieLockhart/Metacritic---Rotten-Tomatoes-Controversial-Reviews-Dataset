Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie In terms of quality is good\\, Story wise Disney is ruining the core and story of Jedi and Star Wars as a whole. bring back the core principles or Star Wars Future will Fail.","true":true}
