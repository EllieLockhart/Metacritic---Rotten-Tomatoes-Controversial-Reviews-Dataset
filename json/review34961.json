Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film reinvented the universe of Star Wars for a whole new generation of people. It's true that it is hard to let go of many of the notions one has truly invested in and associated with the Star Wars universe over the last few decades; to judge however this movie's merits\\, which are many and great- based on preconceived notions and emotional attachments with previous characters\\, is doing a disservice to the great message it manages to pass: the Force will carry on\\, Skywalkers\\, Solo and Organas aside.","true":true}
