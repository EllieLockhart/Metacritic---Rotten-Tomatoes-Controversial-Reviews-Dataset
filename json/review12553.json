Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe the negative reviews. Although I am a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek\\, I guess I'm just not a \\\"superfan\\\"  but fewer people liked it compared with Episode 1? LOL. I'm sorry\\, but this movie was fantastic. I loved it. It was amazing to see and hear on and IMax screen and was very satisfying. It was a far superior to Force Awakens which I very much enjoyed but can't say that I loved. To each his own\\, I suppose\\, but I want to see it again.","true":true}
