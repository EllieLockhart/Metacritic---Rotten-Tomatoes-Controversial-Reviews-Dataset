Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the definition of not knowing what it wants to be. It wanders on aimlessly and accomplishes little to nothing in the way of moving the \\\"plot\\\" forward. Was a complete waste of money and 2 hours of my life that is not worth seeing. The only silver lining this movie has is that the prequels are now not the worst Star Wars Movies!","true":true}
