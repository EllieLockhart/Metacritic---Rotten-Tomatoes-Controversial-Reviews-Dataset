{"101487":127085,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hard to gauge with only one time view\\, but its definitely a good movie\\, provides more depth and realism than TFA with the war and social conflict aspect of it.  The decisions made with Snoke and Luke are definitely the most striking\\, and its a bit confusing that setups from previous material doesnt pay off here\\, so the twists will surprise many. However I bought them in the movie\\, the conflict\\, temptation and motivations are well portrayed in Kyloh and Rey\\, the arcs of Finn and Poe are well made\\, concise. Phasma is lackluster as always\\, but the new characters are cool\\, except for DJ who we didnt get to know that much.\\nSPOILERS BELOW\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nThe Snoke twist is both fresh and reminiscent of ep VI\\, while eliminating the common cliched threat of a big powerful mysterious figure the next movie will have a more human\\, less larger than life villain\\, and also as in ep VI a young inexperienced protagonist is in over their head but the conflict within the bad guy saves them\\, looking back the death of the emperor is also a bit silly\\, this powerful sith falling down a shaft like a manequin? (im still not sure if im ok with Snokes tho)\\, but while in ep VI Vader\u00b4s motivation is grief\\, regret and love\\, Kyloh\u00b4s motivation is anger\\, frustration\\, conflict\\, a feeling of inferiority\\, he doesnt want to go to the light\\, the pull to the dark side is strong with him\\, but he doesnt want to be mistreated and made to do things he would hate to do by Snoke\\, he is an egotistical child who wants freedom and power\\, before him Sidious also killed his master but he was more cold and planning\\, but also seeked power and independence. Luke\u00b4s story Im gonna buy\\, its well explained\\, well told\\, and the advice by Yoda just ties it in really nice. Luke had a lot of responsability\\, got lost on his own mistakes and the mistakes of the Jedi Order past him\\, and couldnt find a way to apply his wisdom.","true":true}
