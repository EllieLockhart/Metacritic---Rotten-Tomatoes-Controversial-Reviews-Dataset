Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't believe this. Such a let down. Left the theater completely disappointed. This is my least favorite movie in the entire saga.. It isnt well written\\, and feels like a Marvel or Super hero movie. Definitely does not feel like the Star Wars (TFA at least felt like a star wars movie). If this is the direction they take the franchise it will no go the way that they think..\\n\\nThey traded in good story telling for cheap surprises that no one would expect\\n\\nWhy would Luke leave a map behind to find him\\, only to say in this movie he never wants to be found? Just stupid.\\n\\nThey undid everything that happened in 4\\,5\\,6. Its all meaningless now we are starting over.\\n\\nJJ gave Rian a blank slate\\, an easy home run\\, and he blew it. Good luck to JJ trying to fix this mess.  \\n \\nStop undoing what happened in the original trilogy\\, the new cast is great and can coexist with the old leaving their legacy and accomplishments intact. \\n\\nGood luck JJ\\, Rian gave you a tangled shit mess to unravel\\, and a disappointed fanbase that didn't get anything they wanted out of this movie other than shitty surprises.","true":true}
