Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great special affects\\, but their are many reasons why I don't like this movie.  Numerous plot holes\\, no respect to the legacy of Star Wars\\, treated Mark Hamil poorly\\, cantina type scene over Disnified\\, poor comedy\\, etc.","true":true}
