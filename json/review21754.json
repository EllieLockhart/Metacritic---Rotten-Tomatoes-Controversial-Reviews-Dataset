Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just Awful\\, everything took forever to happen. The pacing was so slow. Rose was a crap character and shouldn't of been added and her side story is crap. Fin shouldn't have been running away again. Ray and fin should have been together adventuring again. Also what is with the weird black hole crap. Also Fin should end up with Ray.","true":true}
