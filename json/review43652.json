Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was probably the best Star Wars film since Empire\\, in my opinion. Because this seems to be a very polarizing entry in the saga\\, I will give you context: I loved the OT (was raised on it)\\, did not like ANY of the prequels (feel they were a major missed opportunity with some very bad writing\/dialogue\/acting)\\, enjoyed the Clone Wars series (much better character development than the prequels)\\, and loved both The Force Awakens and Rogue One. If your opinions align with those\\, I think you're in for a good time. Just go in free of any expectations except that Rian Johnson is trying to do something bold and new with the series while retaining its heart and soul. I feel he accomplished that and will be recognized and applauded for it in the long run.","true":true}
