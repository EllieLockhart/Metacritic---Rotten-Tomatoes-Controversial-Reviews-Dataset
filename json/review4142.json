Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brought a tear to my eye! A great farewell to Luke Skywalker. I can't help but wonder how all this will resolve. With all the plot twists from this movie it wouldn't surprise me if the Empire ends up winning. The action sequences were great and reminiscent of the earlier films and the inclusion of alien puppets instead of CGI aliens was a refreshing nod towards the original trilogy as well.","true":true}
