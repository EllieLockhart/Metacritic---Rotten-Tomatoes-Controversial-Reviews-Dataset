Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The essence of Star Wars fused into a fresh storyline. Rian Johnson took every Star Wars trope and subverted it\\, a move that has left a lot of fans shaken or upset. The most nuanced Star Wars yet\\, with characters so full of conflict that you feel it too. Visually stunning with a dazzling style\\, it's just as exciting on the third watch as it was on the first.","true":true}
