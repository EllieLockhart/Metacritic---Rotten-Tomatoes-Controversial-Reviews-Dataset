Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite Star Wars movie is Empire Strikes Back.  This movie was not well received by all critics.  Neither is The Last Jedi.  I've seen it twice.  It grew on me a ton\\, the 2nd time.  Luke Skywalker is my favorite character of all time in any genre.  I loved Mark Hamill's performance and I loved Rian Johnson's take on the character.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver were great.  I could have done without the Finn and Rose scene on Canto Bight\\, but I loved the new Rose character.  Look this is Star Wars - and I felt like a kid again.  I was hoping Kylo Ren would become Ben Solo again.  I was hoping Luke Skywalker would save the galaxy.  You know what?  Life isn't perfect and neither is this movie but it's pretty damn good.","true":true}
