{"101487":136576,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm gonna be honest\\, I have on very few occasions took the time out of my day to sit down and scribe a review of a film I've just watched\\, yet I feel totally compelled to after reading the audience reviews for The Last Jedi. I get the feeling that anyone who thinks this film is \\\"unwatchable\\, trash\\, awful\\\" or any synonym of these words\\, simply goes into every new Star Wars flick harbouring ill will. They want it to be bad\\, they expect it to be bad\\, they flat out think it's going to be bad\\, all before laying an eye on it. I am a huge fan of Star Wars to say the least\\, but there seems to be this like horrible cult level of Star Wars fan that has spawned\\, and everyone will know what I mean and a lot of people will know what I mean and likely be exactly what I'm referring to. This type of fan will settle for no opinion on a Star Wars film other than Empire strikes back is the best Star Wars ever closely followed by New Hope and Return Of The Jedi and everything after that is horrific\\, if you like any of the others you are \\\"not a true fan\\\"\\, you \\\"don't understand\\\" and have \\\"no idea about what Star Wars is about\\\". Now Empire Strikes back is my favourite Star Wars\\, but it's f@*#\u00a5 2018. These type of fans will literally NEVER be pleased with anything to come. STOP GOING INTO THE PICTURE HOUSE TO WATCH THESE FILMS EXPECTING\/WANTING\/YEARNING FOR IT TO BE AS GOOD AS\\, BETTER THAN\\, OR REMOTELY SIMILAR TO THE OLD ONES\\, AND WATCH IT AS ITS OWN TRILOGY. \\\"How can we watch it as it's own trilogy if it includes characters from the past that we know and love\\\" GET A GRIP. The pedantic\\, pathetic and quite simply hipster reviews of this film are sickening to read. 1382993 essays on now the film is bad because it didn't include a far fetched fan theory you read on Reddit so therefore the film is an insult to true fans. As far as a The Last Jedi goes as a film\\, I thought it was great. It was fun\\, action packed\\, gripping in parts and T'd us up for a what I hope to be spectacular finale in this trilogy. Truthfully this film and force awakens could be made or broke by the final instalment\\, but I don't think it will disappoint. Acting wise\\, it's not amazing\\, but truthfully I don't think anyone could say any of the Star Wars films are well acted (queue the triggered hipster Star Wars fans) but I also don't think it's fundamental to the franchises success. Everyone's entitled to their opinion and are free to write whatever they like on here\\, I would question a lot of these reviews\\, as I think there is a lot of cynicism and hipsters who like to think \\\"I liked Star Wars when it was good\\\". Good film not earth shattering but definitely worth a watch. I understand this hasn't been a review of sorts and at some point I may dedicate a review and just talk about my thoughts on the film but truthfully I read through these audience reviews and it boiled my piss so I had to put my thoughts into words.","true":true}
