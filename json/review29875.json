Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rose and Finn storyarc sucked\\, Poe and that Aldo\\, Zoldo admiral were clearly screaming forced feminism\\, made 0 sense\\, I only like Luke\\, Leia and Rey and Kylo were the only interesting parts\\, i only give 5 stars for them and for the actors hard work the rest can screw it.  I appreaciate the actors for giving their best in this mess ","true":true}
