Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a vacum\\, I suppose the movie is decent.  However\\, I am one of those people who has grown up with all things Star Wars and am incapable of looking at this movie as anything other than my least favorite chapter in one of my favorite books.  At first\\, I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book to find out how it ends. Even though I am holding out hope that the final chapter will still blow me away\\, The Last Jedi has substantially lowered my enthusiasm.\\n\\nThis was the most disappointing film of the franchise since Disney took over.  Kylo Ren is easily the most compelling character and his story arc is the only reason to watch.  The whole side mission of Finn and Rose was a complete waste of time.  It feels like the previous eight films covered so much ground and each moved this epic story forward. The Last Jedi just felt like filler and when the movie ends you will find yourself asking the exact same questions you had when the movie started.  Adding to the disappointment is the fact that the writers had already killed off Han and Luke on screen when Carrie Fisher died unexpectedly in real life.  So when the Last Jedi ended\\, it was a bummer knowing we had just seen the last hoorah for the original three.  I can't help but feel that this film was a missed opportunity and to a certain degree it has decreased my interest in the new trilogy altogether.","true":true}
