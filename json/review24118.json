Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe I need to see this movie again but my initial impression coming out of the cinema was one of disappointment as The Force Awakens teed up some great storylines and characters which The Last Jedi does not seem to want to follow probably as it has been approached by a new director with a different vision.\\n\\nI am a huge Star Wars fan and can understand the backlash for this movie from fans as it doesn't respect the Star Wars lore as it should but it's not a one star or half a star movie. On the other hand\\, it's not a five star movie either. \\n\\nTo me\\, the original trilogy will never be bettered but I was a kid when I watched these movies and the magic and nostalgia can never be recaptured. The prequel trilogy respected the lore but they were pretty average (with the exception of Revenge of the Sith which I liked). I was also a fan of The Force Awakens but was bored by Rogue One.\\n\\nI have to say that at least The Last Jedi entertained me overall despite its many flaws and at least it can't be accused of being predictable. I might think differently after watching again but at the moment i would recommend going to see it at least so u can decide for yourself whether this is a refreshing new direction\\, a travesty to the Star Wars universe or just simply an entertaining popcorn movie. For me\\, the jury is out at the moment.","true":true}
