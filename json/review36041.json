{"101487":175671,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" starts off with a terrific battle sequence that had me on the edge of my seat numerous times.  However things started to go a bit downhill after that.  As was the case with the previous chapter\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" recycles many scenes and dialogue fro the original trilogy.  There is a scene between Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo that is recycled almost verbatim from \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\".  There are also scenes recycled from \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" as well.  Also I feel the movie was too long.  There were scenes that actually bored me.  However there good things to say about this movie.  The first thing\\, and in my opinion the best thing\\, is Mark Hamill.  He is excellent in this movie and may very well give his best performance of the entire series in this film.  There is also a cameo that worked quite well.  There are some things to like about \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" and I do think the movie is quite good\\, but not nearly as good as the movie's 94% Tomotometer rating makes it out to be.","true":true}
