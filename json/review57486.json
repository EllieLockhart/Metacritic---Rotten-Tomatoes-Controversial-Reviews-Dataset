Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was written by a staff that has never actually watched the series in depth. Despite a large budget\\, the plot and character portrayals are on point with Dragon Ball Evolution. The film can be equated to being internet click bait as the only purpose of this film was to generate funds for Disney to pay back the 4 Billion it payed to George Lucas. The movie made every male character\\, either weak\\, cowardly\\, or irresponsible. Luke Skywalker was portrayed in such a negative light that I would compare it with showing James Bond cry on screen because he lost a fight. Mark Hamill (Luke) is absolutely correct in stating his objection to his own character's interpretation. The Star Wars series is supposed to be about a galaxy far far away and yet this movie is subjugated to modern day social constructs of injustice and holds no balance. In my spare time\\, I could have written a better plot. I can list 7 things that would have made this movie better. 1.) Rey Attempts to lift the X-Wing from the water and receives actual training\\, 2.) Admiral Ackbar is the one to sacrifice himself via the light speed attack instead of dying off screen\\, 3.) Luke is actually present and stops all of the ATAT laser fire showing how powerful he truly is\\, fights Kylo and then holds his lightsaber just as Obi-Wan did when being cut down by Darth Vader\\, 4.) Snoke is not pointlessly killed\\, 5.) Luke does not drink from a sea cow. 6.) Leia is tragically killed and does not end up being a superman internet meme forever\\, 7.) No casino\/save the horses which will be recaptured anyway\/we got thrown in jail because of a parking violation\/we didn't accomplish anything anyway side quest.","true":true}
