Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson\\, Disney and JJ Abrams basically took my hopes and dreams from one of my most cherished childhood memories\\, poured gasoline all over it and burned it to ash. The portrayal of Luke Skywalker in this failure of a film is unforgivable. What was the point of Supreme Leader Snoke? Why even have him in the films if he's going to be discarded the way he was with no explanation of his role? The villain Kylo is a talking buffoon. Rey who up to a few weeks ago was running a junk business and had no clue about the Force or the Jedi is now more powerful than Luke? Give me a break. Pretty much all of it sucks. All the useless and stupid other token characters would be more appreciated in roles where there eaten by giant space monsters or disintegrated. Damn you Rian. Damn you JJ. Damn you Kathleen Kennedy. I wish the three of you could spend eternity being slowly digested in the pit of Sarlac.","true":true}
