Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decepcionado\\,  esperaba concluyera pero es a New hope con escenas copiadas de las pel\u00edculas de la trilog\u00eda original... \\n\\nLos que seguimos las primeras 3 sabr\u00e1n de que hablo.\\n\\nTriste de que Luke se haya convertido en un ermita\u00f1o con trabajadores a su servicio\\,  tan d\u00e9bil.....  y una especie de darth vader pusil\u00e1nime.\\n\\nDecepcionado pero que m\u00e1s pod\u00eda esperar m\u00e1s que un final para darle continuidad a la franquicia.  =(","true":false}
