Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who Cares about what happens in episode 9 they killed the best villain in favor of a pouty child who has temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way. Finn now has a random asian girlfriend that no one cares about but somehow dominated 50 minutes of the movie followed by Jedi Master BB8 who did everything in this movie that was cancerous and lets talk about how they sidelined every original character in the series and to top it all of made the most powerful jedi in the universe a coward who commits suicide and don't let me start on the yoda ghost with force storm that could easily kill any villain in the series or Superman\/Leia aka the most powerful force user weve ever seen that has never used the force before... So fuck episode 9 these predictions and Directors\\, and Disney for choosing to push toys over a decent story.?","true":true}
