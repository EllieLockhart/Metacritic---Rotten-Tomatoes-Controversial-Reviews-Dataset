Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While some fans may have come into this movie with preconceived ideas of what this movie was going to be. I HIGHLY suggest to come into this movie expecting nothing and be open minded. As Luke says \u201cit\u2019s not going to go the way you think\u201d. Truly a spectacular ride of a film.","true":true}
