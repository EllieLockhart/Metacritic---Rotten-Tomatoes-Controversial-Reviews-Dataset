Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a pretty movie. However it is so full of inconsistencies in both the Star Wars universe lore and just the movies own plot line. Storylines end up leading no where. Characters act with no thought of the consequences\\, random aliens are freed while their humanoid caretakers are left behind to deal with the consequences. Somehow we are to believe that there is no greater evil in the galaxy then arms dealers. It makes you wonder if no one will follow the good guys then are they really just the bad guys but we are watching a movie from their delusional perspective. Established characters are doing things outside of their nature as a character and it doesn't add an arc to the plot. It seems to be pushing some kind of political agenda but it's not entirely clear what as this movie is so incoherent. This last point isn't as much a fault of the movie so much as the culture but if someone shares their displeasure of the movie then they are labeled as some kind of bigot and a \\\"alternative subset of the fans\\\". Even though it seems that the majority of the people on this website agree the movie was bad. In conclusion this movie is so bad it makes the prequels look like some of the most perfect movies ever made JarJar and slide transitions and all.","true":true}
