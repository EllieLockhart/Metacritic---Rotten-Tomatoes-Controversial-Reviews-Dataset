Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think Disney tried to make it cute & TRIED to make it funny. But they might get a lot of money on the Star Wars name\\, merchandise\\, & the next movie they break out with!! I didnt feel like Luke Skywalker was a Supreme Jedi\\, nor Rey a master with a light sabor with her lack of training. Snoke was a snooze & Kilo Ren is a spoiled brat! I would not recommend this movie. Just stick with the classics.","true":true}
