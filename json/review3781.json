Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beware of all the 5 star one sentence reviews. Disney must be trying to inflate the numbers. Absolute garbage. Plot holes everywhere. Disney needs a do over and pretend this and the force awakens never happened. I cannot get over the fact that they completely crap on the older trilogies. ","true":true}
