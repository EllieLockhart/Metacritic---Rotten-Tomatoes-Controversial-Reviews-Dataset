Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow what a disappointment - loved 7 and was excited to see 8. What a borefest I actual found myself wanting to walk out of the movie. Way to long and poorly cut. Don't believe all the hype!!!! Save your money. It was as bad and maybe even worse then star wars episode 1. ","true":true}
