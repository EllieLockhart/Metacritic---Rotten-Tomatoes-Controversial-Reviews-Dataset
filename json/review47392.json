Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What could possibly be the most disappointing Star Wars film I have seen to date. When I left the theater\\, I could not shake the feeling that it did not earn anything. Character plots were weak\\, the general atmosphere felt lacking\\, and overall the film itself just felt like it was not a Star Wars film. What I once believed would be a great trilogy\\, now has me worried to the point that I do not understand how they will end this. The whole plot of this trilogy seems so lost\\, that as a life long star wars fan\\, I have no idea the direction it will head now. It is with a heavy heart that I cannot recommend this film to anyone. I can only hope that JJ Abrams can now fix the mess that is this trilogy and find a way to correct its course which may be already too far gone. Only time will tell\\, but in its current state use your money elsewhere.","true":true}
