Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Congrats Rian Johnson you killed Star Wars. ok would love to write all the reason why I hated this movie\\, but i don't have time to write a novel. Snoke and Phasma.... Wasted... You portrayed a childhood hero as a grumpy loser that hated the Jedi. You had about 100 plot holes in the movie. it was just terrible","true":true}
