Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching TLJ for the first time and being a bit disappointed\\, I went back to see it a second time and was much happier and satisfied when the credits rolled. This is definitely a movie that gets better the more times it's viewed\\, though there are still some scenes and new characters I don't much care for. After watching some SW theory videos on YouTube\\, I'm excited to go see TLJ a third time and really pay attention to the brilliant\\, fine details woven throughout the film and be surprised all over again!
