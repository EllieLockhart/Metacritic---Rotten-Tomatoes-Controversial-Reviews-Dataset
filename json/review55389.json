Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love the originals because the film's had a great cohesive storyline and terrific characters.  This film is all over the place.  Could easily have edited 30 minutes of worthless garbage out.  Lots of outright political garbage inserted into the film.  Liea becomes Superman is among one of the dumbest moments I've ever seen in any film.  I can't imagine how this film made it out the door past quality control at Disney.  The fact that it did just proves that Hollywood and its entire industry is truly just a bunch of gutless go alongs at this point.  No one has the courage to rock the boat and speak truth to money or power.  Unfortunately the art is being lost.  This film is not art its pre-packaged storyline is filled with more holes than the Titanic ands its attempts at humor and cute and cuddly merchandise friendly characters fall flat not to mention its overtly political tone throughout is very obviously intentional.  I will never see another film by this director again.  It was awful.  Classless trash!","true":true}
