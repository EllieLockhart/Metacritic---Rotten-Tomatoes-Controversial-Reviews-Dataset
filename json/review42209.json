Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie signifies the traditional battle between elites\/suits in Hollywood thinking they are great\\, when in reality the man on the street knows their own product better than they do. It's so bad I can sum it up with this\\, my kids told me \\\"we don't like Star Wars\\, can we watch something else.\\\" To me a dad and a life long fan\\, this speaks volumes.","true":true}
