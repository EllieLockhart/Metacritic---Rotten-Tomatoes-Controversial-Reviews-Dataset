Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seemed like they made this film without even seeing TFA.  Finn and Rey's relationship is abandoned\\, Finn is just comic relief instead of being a possible Jedi\\, and Kylo Ren is even less imposing of a villain.  Snoke was a disappointment in every way.  He could have been a solid villain\\, but.. wasn't.  And why even have Luke Skywalker in these films if this is what you do with his character?  If he was Snoke\\, that would have been something interesting\\, at the very least.  TFA wasn't perfect\\, but it layed the foundation of what could have been a good trilogy of films.  Unfortunately\\, all that hard work was wasted.","true":true}
