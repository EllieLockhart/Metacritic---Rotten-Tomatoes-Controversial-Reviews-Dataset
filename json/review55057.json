Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it 5 times.  Because I'm a lifetime Star Wars fan\\, I want to like it. I keep looking for something to like\\, but The Last Jedi is so bad that now I want Rey (who I thought might be interesting after The Force Awakens) to get a light saber through her skull in episode IX.  I HATE this move with the white hot heat of ten thousand suns.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have murdered Star Wars.","true":true}
