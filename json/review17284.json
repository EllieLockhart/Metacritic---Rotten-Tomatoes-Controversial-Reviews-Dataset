Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this film more\\, don\u2019t get me wrong\\, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as terrible as some are saying\\, but I agree that the critics got this wrong. There are some truly fantastic parts of this film\\, brilliant character development and some breathtaking visuals. There are also some great performances from the cast\\, both old and new alike\\, the poignantcy you get from watching Carrie Fishers last performance will stay with me and must surely mark as a high point for many a fan. However\\, when you look back on the film\\, you realise the main plot makes little sense\\, it must be the slowest chase in history. The film is too long\\, something I never thought I would complain about in a Star Wars movie and there are subplots that are just unnecessary. Then there\u2019s the humour\\, one of the great things about TFA is that it injected humour back into the franchise\\, but with this film it boarders on being slapstick\\, there is a scene right at the start that is more akin to spaceballs than Star Wars\\, thankfully it doesn\u2019t persist but for me it seemed rather forced\\, sometimes spot on\\, but then other times just there because it\u2019s been decided that the audience should laugh twice per scene. Overall I enjoyed it and I\u2019ve watched it twice now\\, but it\u2019s not the best of the series\\, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as TFA and I badly want to love it...","true":true}
