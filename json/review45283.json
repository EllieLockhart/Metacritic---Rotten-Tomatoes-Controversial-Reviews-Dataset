Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upon seeing the movie\\, all I can say is that the effects were good\\,but not much else. Being a Star Wars fan since the age of 5 made this experience hurt so much more. Unless there are some serious plot changes in the next installment\\, I will not be seeing it. What hurts even more though is the fact that they have succeeded in disappointing the greatest Star Was fan of them all( my childhood hero as well) Mark Hamill","true":true}
