Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie doesn't feel as much like a Star Wars movie and makes some very poor choices regarding its plot. It does have great visuals except for maybe the visit to Kanto Blight\\, where the horse-like creatures were very poorly done and the scenery and cinematography diverged greatly from anything we have experienced in a Star Wars movie to date. Wasted opportunities and too many bad fanboy ideas that should have gotten the axe. Overall\\, very meh for me.","true":true}
