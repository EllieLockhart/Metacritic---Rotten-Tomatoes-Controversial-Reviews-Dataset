Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is inconsistent\\, and half of it is a complete waste of time ando could hace been easily avoided. Abrams has a lot to do ti fix this crap.","true":true}
