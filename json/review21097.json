Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited for this film because I loved Force Awakens but I left feeling like WTF.  I just don't understand what's up with all the agendas and now they have ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
