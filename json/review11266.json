Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the movie is a bit of a mess in specialy a storyline in the movies which people who went to the movie know what I am reffering to but The Last jedi sets up for Ep 9 like being a huge decesive battle across on every sistem of the galaxy which might be the only reason why I liked the movie because of the setup for the next one.","true":true}
