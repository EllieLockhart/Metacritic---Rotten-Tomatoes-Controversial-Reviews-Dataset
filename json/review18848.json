Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IT'S A PIECE OF fEMMINIST sjw BULLSHIT.. i WOULD RATHER WATCH ANOTHER EPISODE WITH jar jar binx THAN THIS PRO-CRITIC\\, ANTI-FAN BULLSHIT.. CONGRATULATIONS dISNEY\\, YOU HAVE ALIENATED YOUR ENTIRE FANBASE AND WILL NEVER TURN A PROFIT ON STAR WARS. yOU LITERALLY RAPED IT TO DEATH.","true":true}
