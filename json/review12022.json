Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie.  I am as die hard a Star Wars nerd as they come. This was a fresh take on Star Wars that kept me guessing to the very end.  There were flaws in this movie\\, as there is with any movie\\, but overall it works.  I will see this movie many more time and I hope they continue in this direction.","true":true}
