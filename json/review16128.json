Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im confused why this movie is served fresh. Why so many critics gave this movie good reviews. Star Wars the Last Jedi teats down all of the plots points put in by Force Awakens and  leaves nothing to come back for the third installment. I have no desire to watch the next star wars film because the movie did not set up any character development. The writing is horrid and the jokes are wrongly timed for an awkward combination.","true":true}
