Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite all of the critical acclaim. This movie was absolute garbage. By far the worst Star wars movie to date. The entire movie serves almost no purpose\\, and does nothing to advance the story or saga forward. \\n\\nThe movie is two and half hours of mundane\\, that tries to be different just for the sake of it. It takes everything that was setup by TFA and just brushes it aside. \\n\\nThe portrayal of Luke was horrible and so far removed from everything we know about him. They managed to take Finn\\, a character that was a bright spot in TFA and devalue him to the point he is irrelevlant. \\n\\nRIAN Johnson should not be allowed near the star wars franchise ever again. I'm hoping that Episode IX can salvage the mess that we are left with.","true":true}
