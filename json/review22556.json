Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's say I'm an occasional SW fan. This means I've seen all the movies more than once and enjoyed them (tolerated I\\, II & III). However\\, I loved Rian Johnson's film. From what I've read\\, I'm in the minority. I loved Rey & Luke's storyline. Liked Poe's story line. And am obsessed with Kylo Ren & Rey's complicated relationship. Canto Bight was visually beautiful but boring\\, but I do love Rose. I loved seeing the character interactions more than any light saber fight. Sorry fanboys. Rian Johnson has created a new Star Wars fan.","true":true}
