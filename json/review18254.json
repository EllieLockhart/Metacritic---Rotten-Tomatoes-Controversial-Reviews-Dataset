Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the film was well done\\, kudos to Rian Johnson for taking the plot down unexpected paths. That\u2019s what makes Star Wars great... before ESB\\, who would have thought Darth Vader was Luke\u2019s father. Before AOTC\\, who knew R2D2 could fly. Nothing is set in stone and anything you thought you knew about the characters can change. Luke\u2019s character is akin to real life\\, people evolve over time. Kylo Ren is a much better character this time around. Still wish they would have built out a greater storyline for Captain Phasma. Great unexpected cameo from a certain favorite character from the original trilogy. Pacing could have been improved upon. Cinematography was incredible\\, especially the final battle. Those complaining about the lack of character development with the villain\\, how many Star Wars villains are actually built out well in the films? The Emperor wasn\u2019t prior to the prequels and Darth Maul and Count Dooku certainly weren\u2019t either. I\u2019m sure there will be more answers in Episode IX. ","true":true}
