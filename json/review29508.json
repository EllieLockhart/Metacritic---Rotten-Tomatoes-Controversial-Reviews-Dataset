Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is the Joel Schumacher of the Star Wars franchise.  This movie was terrible.  All the setup JJ did in the force awakens gets thrown away.  Rey is a Marry Sue and the movie has quite a few femenist\/SJW theme going on.  The humor misses the mark.  Keep that in Guardians of the galaxy and let Star Wars continue to be Star Wars.  Speak with your wallets and see this when it's on red box\\, along with future installments.  Sad day for Star Wars fans","true":true}
