Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understood people having an issue with how safe the Force Awakens was\\, but I was one of the people who actually saw the familiarity as a positive following the awful prequel movies\\, and made me believe that Star Wars was going in the right direction. As a result\\, I went into The Last Jedi excited\\, optimistic and certain I was going to love the film.\\n\\nI have seen the movie twice\\, as I left the first showing confused\\, disappointed and annoyed. I thought maybe I had missed something so went a second time the next day only to leave more disappointed and annoyed. I am a Star Wars fanatic\\, I love the original trilogy\\, the extended universe and the lore\\, but this movie (for me) absolutely demolished my hope for this franchise.\\n\\nIn my opinion Rian Johnson has tried to be far too clever as a way to avoid the criticism that Force Awakens received for too much fan service. He has intentionally created something confusing and unexpected for the sake of it\\, not to drive the plot forward. No part of the movie was entertaining\\, and every single scene fell short and left more questions than answers.\\n\\nI am annoyed at how Skywalker was depicted\\, and I have no idea where episode 9 can go from here. I have erased this film from my own personal canon.\\n\\nAs a side note\\, I am sick of seeing people who were genuinely disappointed with the movie being abused and ridiculed by people online who loved the movie. People are as entitled to hate it as you are to love it. Get a life","true":true}
