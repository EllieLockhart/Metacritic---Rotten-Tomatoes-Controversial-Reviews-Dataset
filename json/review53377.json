Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did these critics see the same movie I did?  Because the one I watched sucked.  I enjoyed JJ Abrams take in Episode 7.  I walked out obsessed with what may happen next.  Was Luke a gray Jedi?  Would we see him ignite a gold lightsaber?  Who is this Snoke?  Who are Rey's parents?  I can't wait to see how powerful Luke is now!.......did any of that happen?  No...... Luke went from Jedi to geriatric.  No real lightsaber battles.  Snoke became a completely irrelevant character whose existence never mattered.  All the balance talk in the trailers were nothing but dialogue.  Luke didn't teach Rey anything but somehow she's an expert in the force who after following Luke around the island for half the move just steals his books and leaves.  Then he just faded away at the end?  Really?  That is the end of Luke Skywalker?  Don't pick literally the dumbest and most anticlimactic way to end one of the greatest characters in cinema history.  I won't be buying a theater ticket for the next one.","true":true}
