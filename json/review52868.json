Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Although this movie has the best cinematography of the entire franchise\\, Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi' just feels very messy. Rian Johnson tried to make the movie suprising by constantly doing the exact opposite of what he was setting up\\, but it ultimately felt really sloppy. The movie spends a lot of time with storylines that lead to nowhere. Luke Skywalker's is very different from the previous movies\\, which didn't have to be a bad thing\\, but there weren't really any good reasons given why he became the way he is in this movie. Many times when the movie became interesting it turned around and did something odd and boring. New ideas are briefly explored\\, but the movie isn't very new and refreshing as many claim it to be. The movie didn't spark any interest inside of me to watch any more of these movies\\, since it's not really setting up anything interesting or new.","true":true}
