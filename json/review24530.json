Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most polarizing movie I have ever seen in my mind...A combination of sheer genius and insane stupidity...Great action movie with major plot holes\\, But horrible star wars movie.  Lots of great characters and wonderful acting that were ultimately wasted.  I agree with Mark Hamill when he said he fundamentally disagreed with Luke's character.  Ultimately\\, i must go back to my feeling when i left the Theatre.....as awesome of what i saw\\, i was......Disappointed.","true":true}
