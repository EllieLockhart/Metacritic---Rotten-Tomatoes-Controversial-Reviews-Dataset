Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie yet. Disney literally burned to the ground everything we know and love about the Star Wars lore. There's no mystery and no magic left. Any character or plot you cared about from The force awakens is either skipped over like it never happened or taken in a direction that just baffles me. Who is Snoke\\, who are Rey's parents\\, the knights of Ren\\, Luke being the biggest baddest Jedi of all time\\, Disney & Rian Johnson could care less about any of this in favor of shoving a will they or won't they love story down our throats. A 2 hour chase movie with thrown together action shots. \\nThis was the pirates of the carribean of Star Wars\\, a super hero summer action movie for the people who like flashy lights\\, loud noises\\, explosions with a horrible plot that doesn't make any sense and is full of holes with cheesy unnecessary one liners.\\nDisney & Rian Johnson should never be allowed to touch Star wars again after this monstrosity.","true":true}
