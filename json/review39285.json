Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film\\, helmed by a director far more clever and talented than JJ Abrams\\, touched on the lore and essence of Star Wars mythos like no other before it. We have not seen character development like this since 1983. Overall\\, a beautifully well crafted\\, layered film that has far more to say than The Force Awakens.","true":true}
