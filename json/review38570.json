Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie ever made... and that's saying something because Clone Wars was terrible.  Say what you will about the Force Awakens\\, at least the plot made sense.  Rian Johnson absolutely ruined the franchise with this movie.  The writing and dialogue were awful\\, the movie was paced like a shitty carnival ride\\, the humor wasn't funny and very poorly placed\\, they took a dump all over Luke's legacy\\, and there's so many plot holes it's laughable.... I will not be seeing another Star Wars movie in theaters\\, it's the only way I know how to tell Disney what they've allowed to happen to this franchise is completely unacceptable.","true":true}
