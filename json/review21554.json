{"101487":147826,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Jar Jar Binks is somewhere smiling and feeling vindicated. \\n\\nThis wasn't a star wars movie\\, and as a movie it was an ok movie. Rian Johnson stated somewhere that he shouldn't be distracted by what fans wanted\\, well\\, he wasn't lying. You can say what you want about the force awakens (I loved it a lot\\, but I understand why some saw it as a mirror image of new hope\\, and liked it less as a result) at least it seemed that JJ did care about the fans.\\n\\nWARNING: Spoilers.\\nThere are a lot of issues that were mentioned here very eloquently by others\\, those are some of the main ones for me:\\n1.\tSnoke is? Well who cares\\, and let's kill him in a stupid way\\, that goes against how the character was built up.\\n2.\tPrincess Lia flying in space? We never really seen her use the force that much and now she can do all of this?\\n3.\tRey's parents. While I wanted her to be a Skywaker\\, the choice of her parents being just nobody's wouldn't have been as bad\\, if: 1. she didn't have a special bond with Luke's saber's. 2. She would have trained much more in the ways of the Jedi to develop the gifts that she has. \\n4.\tProgs: what was their role again? Yes\\, selling staff.\\n5.\tLuke. Why was he projecting himself and not down fighting (and then dying as result) that would have been more in character with this franchise.\\n6.\tThe poetical messages in the movie about greed of powerful organizations\\, would have been much more profound and much less superficial if it didn't come from a company that boycotts journalist that give it bad reviews or forces distribution agreements on theaters.\\n7.\tThis is less about the movie but about the reactions from some to fans who didn't like the movie: conspiracy theories about right wing people posting negative comments (seriously that is one of the claims to explain the negative reviews)\\, or people who liked the Justice League movie exacting their revenge on the critics who loved the last Jedi (again\\, seriously that is one of the claims to explain the negative reviews)\\, or if you didn't like the movie it means that you are against minorities (as mentioned\\, I loved the Force Awakens introduction of a strong female character and the other nontraditional star wars characters). I don't believe in those kind of conspires but some of those issues make me think that perhaps there is some sort of projection here by the side that did say the movie was good. There is also the issue of people saying that it's our problem if we don't like this movie\\, and we should like it\\, why? They have the right to like the movie and express their views\\, and we have the right not to like it\\, and express our views.\\n8.\tThis is obviously not the worst thing in the world\\, not even close\\, but for those who say that fans are taking this too seriously\\, Disney is also taking this very seriously (and they changed directors to several movies in this franchise as a result) because the success of this franchise is worth billions of dollars.  At least the fans are not into making profit out of this franchise. Movies can inspire people and set an example for them in how to live\\, so this not all just a movie.","true":true}
