The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is not just a sequel\\, but the continuation of the story from the first game. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called The Last of Us: Part II. I fell in love with the first game. The journey of Joel\\, from loving father\\, to broken man\\, to hardened survivor\\, to finally allowing himself to open back up again to this little girl... Ellie made Joel whole again.However\\, in Part II\\, we get answers to the hard questions we were left with in Part I. How would Ellie respond if she found out the truth about Salt Lake\\, and what were\\, if any\\, the repercussions of Joel\u2019s actions?The monsters in Pittsburgh\\, who ambushed Joel and Ellie\\, the ones who would murder people in the streets just to take their shoes and whatever else they could find... Joel admits that the reason he knew it was a trap was because he had been on both sides. It\u2019s part of what created such a division between he and Tommy years prior to meeting Ellie. What they had to do to survive was awful. Many innocent people died\\, because\\, as Joel put it\\, it was either them or him.That comes back to haunt him\\, in a way that is truly unimaginable to us\\, as gamers. And it hurts. What is done to Joel - a character I related with - was so cruel\\, and cold\\, and ruthless\\, and done without a second thought. It\u2019s what puts us in Ellie\u2019s shoes. We want revenge\\, and we want it now.However\\, what Naughty Dog does so well in this game is to show us that cycle of loss\\, revenge and violence\\, in a way we never got to see in the first game. The path Ellie takes to get \u201cjustice\u201d is paralleled with Abby\u2019s path for \u201cjustice\u201d on the man who took her Joel... her father. Abby found him dead in a pool of his own blood\\, along with many of the people she called family. They were killed without remorse\\, without hesitation\\, by a man named Joel Miller.The Last Of Us: Part II forces us to look at its world and see it\u2019s far less black and white than we would have liked to have believed\\, even though we knew it wasn\u2019t.In the end\\, I knew I didn\u2019t want to see Ellie go down the same path Joel did... and Joel didn\u2019t want that for her either. In fact\\, it was the last thing he would\u2019ve wanted. He fought for her\\, he did things that\\, yes\\, were horrible... for her\\, so that she could live her life... and he\u2019d do it all over the same way. Because\\, to him\\, she was his world\\, and he wanted her to experience the life that Sarah never got the chance to.In the end... the very end... Ellie saw that. She felt the love Joel had for her\\, and it gave her the strength\\, in her most darkest moment\\, to let go. It\u2019s the same strength Ellie unknowingly gave Joel 4 years prior\\, and it was love\\, and not revenge\\, that granted it.I\\, for one\\, am glad she found that strength before it was too late. She saved Joel\\, and Joel saved her.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
