Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An hour too long. Way too many filler scenes. Surprisingly ep.7 had better pacing than this and it pains me to admit that. \\n\\nToo many inconsistencies.\\n\\nFinn was a waste of movie footage\\n\\nAlthough there were some great scenes in this.\\n\\nKylo Ren was way more entertaining in this one\\n\\nMark Hamill was great as usual as Luke bringing the spiritual aspect back in the saga but it was too late","true":true}
