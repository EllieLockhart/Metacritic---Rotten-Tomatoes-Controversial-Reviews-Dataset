Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I start? I guess I'll start with the positives. The little owl looking creatures are cute\\, Chewbacca\\, and R2D2s parts are great and that is about it. The story is stupid\\, doesn't nothing to move the narrative forward and is muddy at best.  I absolutely hate the prequels and this makes me long for the likes of Episode one and Jar Jar Binks. The whole big premise of this movie. \\\"Hey\\, were out of gas\\\" and need to outrun the big bad guy. And Rey\\, oh\\, shes just garbage. Nobody important. Really?? One can only hope this is a lie and will be revealed in the 3rd installment.","true":true}
