Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me started\\,  critics are paid to leave reviews audiences or not. As a single movie not part of a Star Wars film this film is bearable but still doesn't make any sense. Biggest upset for me is that it completely and us in entirety everything the force awakens did in regards to further canon of the Star Wars franchise. I could go on and on and on and on  about the negative things in this film just doesn't fit. Cinematography and affects scenery were absolutely fantastic there are moments in the film leave you truly awestruck in regards to effect and certain actions but the story is a big fat no.  The younger fans will undoubtedly love this and that's what Disney want but the main core bass fans people who grew up this film like me will be left bitterly disappointed\\, bar a few.  This film is desperately trying to carry vote based on the effects and cinematography. For those who grew up and those you love a deeper storyline especially in the sense of a sequel in a trilogy will probably walk out scratching their heads as to what they've just watched.  I am praying final instalment of the trilogy can redeem the whole mess of the last Jedi somewhat .","true":true}
