Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know how to solve ALL of this mess. I can save everything. \\nSince they 'jumped the shark' already\\, with Leia. Why don't we go all the way.\\nGo full on 'Dallas'. It was all a dream. Or in this case\\, a vision. \\nWe open Ep. 9 right where JJ left off in 7. (And I personally did not like 7 either....but I digress) We open with  Rey holding the lightsaber and Luke holding it too. Luke lets go\\, and steps away\\, overwhelmed. He just saw the image of the future if he didn't train Rey. Episode 8 was how everything will turn out to be a disaster if he does not train her. Done.","true":true}
