Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film. More worried about hitting quotas and being edgy then actually creating something that could be called a movie. Made u want to cover your face as u watched a director and script try and pay hommage to \\\"empowerment\\\" the result of which created cringy characters that were unreaistic and frankly quite sad. By making a point of \\\"empowering\\\" you are just revealing your own biases about the group u want to \\\"empower\\\". So sad! I pity you! I pity u because of the satisfaction it brings me.","true":true}
