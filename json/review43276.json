Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disappointment. The entire film recycled content from the other movies to the extent that there is very little creativity or originality in this film. The plot is boring and lacks continuity and consistency with the legacy created in the original trilogy and the prequal trilogy. Though many argue that criticizers hold unrealistic expectations\\, there are so many obvious issues: Luke's sad legacy\\, the illogical strategic action\\, pointless segments and characters. It's a big\\, big sad.","true":true}
