Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it\\, from beginning to end. This movie captured my imagination like no other Star Wars movie\\, and now I'm obsessed. I would have liked the rebellion to have made a bit more (read: any) progress\\, but the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey covers up any flaws for me.","true":true}
