Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bit boring and lacked focus. Too many extraneous jokes and characters\\, too many plot holes and things that just plain didn't make sense given everything we know about the Star Wars universe. We desperately want to see more about the current state of affairs in the Galaxy and be taken to cool\\, new places ... not stuck aboard a spaceship slowly losing fuel for half the movie\\, with nothing the bad guys can do but fire every so often at their shields and wait???","true":true}
