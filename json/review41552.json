Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is genuinely bad. Not just the pointless storylines that have been seen before. Not just the over-the-top acting and writing. Not just the floating Leia. The movie isn't even bad because of the creative decisions Rian Johnson made with the Star Wars world. What makes this movies bad is the close up face shots\\, the gross and pointless characters\\, and the fact that Johnson seems to have never seen The Force Awakens. I think I would like this movie better if it were a stand-alone film outside of J. J. Abrams story\\, but it would still be bad.","true":true}
