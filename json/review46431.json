Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted characters\\, wasted deaths and with all that the story hardly progressed at all. overall this film was a major disappointment. on the plus side its well shot and as some really cool scenes.","true":true}
