Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At no time in this movie do two lightsabers touch in battle (well one quicky in a flashback). Let me repeat.... No lightsaber fight!! How is this possible? A star wars movie without a lightsaber battle? NO\\, the kylo \/ Rey scene does not count as they were a team. And a freaking halogram? This was the modern day Bobby Ewing return to Dallas!!! Did no one notice all this at Disney???","true":true}
