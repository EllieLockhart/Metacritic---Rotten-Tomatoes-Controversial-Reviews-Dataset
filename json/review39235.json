Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film failed to really do anything positive. There was no weight behind decisions or events\\, few characters received any form of development and there was no sense of progression. The film heavily poached from past entries in the saga and created numerous problems\\, using flawed logic every step of the way. There were a few choices in regards to sound FX I really liked and it looked good\\, but given the budget those are expectations not achievements.","true":true}
