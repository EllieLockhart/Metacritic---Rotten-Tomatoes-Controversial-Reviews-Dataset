Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad: Science\\, Writing\\, Plot\\, Vandalized characters\\, Pet Wookie\\, Demoralized crippled Luke\\, Uninspired Leia\\, They shot Han\\, The Plot makes no sense\\, Why is there gravity in space. Don't get me started. There is so much wrong with this movie. It's garbage. The writing is filled with formulaic tropes\\, It rips off Tropes from other movies\\, like Harry potter\\, & the previous Star Wars. Rey is Luke only better\\, Phantasma is Bobba Fett only worse. They ripped off scenes directly from other movies\\, & other star wars. Word for for\\, line for line. It was awful. Nothing original. And the changes are childish.\\n\\nGood: Special affects. The Visual affects\\, & creature affects are the only good thing about this movie.","true":true}
