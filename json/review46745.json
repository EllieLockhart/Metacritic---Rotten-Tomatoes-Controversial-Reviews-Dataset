Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well after making star wars great again they really failed with this movie. So many cool directions they could have went and they choose to do nothing. Nothing in this movie is worth remembering. If these critic reviews aren't bought then those guys are watching a different movie entirely.","true":true}
