{"101487":100046,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After thoroughly enjoying The Force Awakens (despite some definite complaints - it wasn't a perfect movie) I was excited to see TLJ and find out where Rey and Kylo Ren's stories would go. Unfortunately\\, none of the character development choices worked for me in this film. I found Rey's backstory to be completely unsatisfying (to the point where I was expecting the 'reveal' not to be the true story by the end\\, but apparently it is\\, and it makes no sense)\\, and Kylo has an arc that bends back around to where he started\\, effectively accomplishing nothing. Just as in TFA\\, there are unnecessary call-backs to the original film that didn't need to be there and serve no necessary story-telling purpose.\\n\\nPerhaps my largest complaint is in the tone of the movie. So many dramatic scenes or serious moments are completely undercut by a joke or goofy visual. The movie seems afraid to take itself seriously\\, especially at times when the original films did not joke around (during Luke's Jedi training with Yoda\\, for example). Rey's training scenes are punctuated with humor in a way that makes the whole enterprise seem like it's not to be taken seriously. Practically every character in the movie is cracking jokes - Finn and Poe\\, Rey\\, Luke\\, Leia... and then there are the porgs\\, CGI creatures that exist for the purpose of comic relief and nothing else\\, with BB-8 serving a similar role. There's nothing wrong with occasional comic relief (the original films had it with R2-D2 and C-3P0\\, for example)\\, but every character can't be the funny one.\\n\\nI never thought I'd have to say something like this\\, but there were moments in this film that gave me flashbacks to the prequel trilogy. There's a completely unnecessary and overindulgent scene in a casino that features CG characters and animals and a chaotic chase sequence. It all looks fake and sterile like the prequels\\, and the plot point accomplished there (finding a code-breaker) had nothing to do with the choice of setting and action. Besides that\\, this film also has the prequel problem of having too many things going on at once\\, so that the film is constantly cutting between multiple different story lines. It's impossible to focus on one thing and really understand or care about what's happening in the movie: by the end you've got Rey and Kylo Ren's story\\, the Resistance being chased by the First Order story (which has its own subplot involving Poe)\\, and Finn and Rose's side mission all happening at the same time\\, and it's too much.\\n\\nAs someone who grew up with the original trilogy and has a deep appreciation for the Star Wars universe\\, I found TLJ to be more disappointing than entertaining. The worst thing I can say about it is that I don't even want to see it again.","true":true}
