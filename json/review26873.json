Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best films in the entire franchise. Complex and funny with a great cast of old and new characters. Gleefully diverting from the old Star Wars format in the best way. I am more excited about this franchise than I have been in a long time. Kill your heros!","true":true}
