It really is a shame to see how far they've fallen under the leadership of Neil Druckmann. He has close ties with Anita Sarkisian (anti-gamer) and you can tell she played a major influence in this game.  When it comes to The Last of Us Part II\\, it's some of the worst story telling from all games prior.\r\rThe only positive I could think of while playing The Last of Us II was how amazing the graphics are\\, but it's the epitome of proof graphics are not everything to make a good game.\r\rReviewers are right to compare this with Game of Thrones season 8\\, because that is where it falls in line in terms of story and character development. Not only do the characters from the original TLOU do things that are totally out of character all to move the plot along\\, but what happens to them is disrespectful and infuriating. It is not joke to say the story is not only a slap in the face to the fans\\, but a hard hitting nuke to head with Druckmann pissing agenda on the ashes (Yes\\, it's that bad!).\r\rAside from story\\, the gameplay is average at best\\, and mediocre at worst. While the original The Last of Us was ground breaking in terms of gameplay and story\\, it's a game that is now six years old! Part II does nothing groundbreaking from it's predecessor\\, and feels very last generation with very little to offer. It is a tedious exploration going from one area to the next\\, fighting hordes of enemies over and over only to have another cinematic with characters I care nothing about. After a while I just want to stop playing The Last of Us II altogether\\, and move onto something more enjoyable like God of War.\r\rI truly believe with Niel Druckmann at the helm it will be the end of Naughty Dog after playing The Last of Us II. I feel terrible for the employees that work under him\\, their blood\\, sweat\\, and tears for an oppressive manager like Niel will only bring morale down within the company. Hopefully ND will realize the mistake they made with Niel and beg for Amy Hennig to come back to take the reigns again. It is wishful thinking\\, but it's going to be sad from here on out knowing how my once favorite developer has fallen from grace solely for an agenda they want to force down upon others\\, and gamers are the ones who lose because of it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
