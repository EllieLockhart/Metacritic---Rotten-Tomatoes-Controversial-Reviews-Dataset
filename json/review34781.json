Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Director killed Star wars. For anyone who thinks the last jedi will go in a better direction\\, I ask you: what direction is there with no Jedi\\, no Sith\\, and people with Force powers never need training? This movie and its philosophy is a joke. The director needs to be banned from making movies.","true":true}
