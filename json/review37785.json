Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a lot of plot holes and things that didn't make sense. A lot of the characters that were established in TFA were very different in this one. There were several distracting plot points that either didn't contribute to\\, or took away from the bigger story. I can see where they were trying to be different but they were trying too hard and in doing so\\, many of the \\\"new\\\" things just felt forced.","true":true}
