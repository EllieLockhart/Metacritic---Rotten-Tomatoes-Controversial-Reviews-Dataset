{"101487":135022,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(I'll do my best to make this review spoiler free)I held on for a while to post this review\\, I wanted to film to sink in so I was not jumping the gun on the verdict as I must admit I left the cinema with a lot of mixed feelings towards this film. Three days on and I'm still pretty split on this movie.\\n\\nIf you want to stop here at the risk of me spoiling minor things for you\\, my general feeling on this film is Meh... Okay\\, here we go then\\, lets start with the positives.\\n\\nThis was thankfully not just The Empire Strikes Back with a 21st century skin\\, I think a lot of fans walked away from The Force Awakens loving that hit of classic star wars done well but were worried we were going to get stories we were told 40 years ago. I'm happy to report that is not the case! The story feels new enough to take the Star Wars universe into new territory which really is great news as the star wars universe has been lacking new ideas since Return of the Jedi (at least in the film realm). \\n\\nThe new characters I was stoked about in Force Awakens are going from strength to strength in terms of their development as our new heroes and villains\\, my negative feelings towards the campy General Hux still remain from Ep 7 but everyone else is going from strength to strength\\, giving us a really compelling group of characters coming into the final chapter of the new trilogy.\\n\\nFinally for the good\\, this is a beautifully made film\\, Rian Johnson has conjured some striking imagery in this film and each frame is beautifully lit and shot to engage you in the screen. Okay\\, fun time over\\, into the painful bits!\\n\\nOkay and now time for the problems of which there are many. While the characters are great some are pigeon holed into plot lines that have no impact on the film and push us into (sadly) territory covered in the prequels. Finn in particular is wasted through the whole film and his new side kick has no real impact on the audience or the story unfolding. This film has the ingredients of a good story but these ingredients have bloated out the whole leading to a good 45 mins of footage that really never needed to be their\\, a tighter 2 hour run time would have fixed a few pointless plot points\\, not to mention cut out 2 of the 3 logical end points in this film. \\n\\nWhere Rogue One did such a good job of telling a Star Wars story grounded in a grit and tension of the war unfolding between rebels and the empire\\, Last Jedi has too much levity and humour for it's own good. Don't get me wrong there are some genuinely funny\\, crowd pleasing moments\\, but the whole vibe of the film has me worried that Disney are only concerned about making one type of film\\, one that we commonly see in Marvel movies. \\n\\nI love the Marvel movies and I believe the tone of those films help what make them the juggernaut we see today\\, but does every big franchise need the tone? this look? does every hero need to crack wise like Han Solo? Does every villain need to be a bumbling fool around said wise crackers? Do we need a variety of cute CGI critters to save the day and make us go awwww? Let Marvel be Marvel and let Star Wars be Star Wars! \\n\\nAnother major gripe that I can't get into too much in fear of spoiling anything but fan service in this film is often laughable\\, it feels like so many characters and elements of the previous trilogy have placed in the film so that audiences will have something to say like\\, \\\"Oh this guy's here\\, that's awesome\\,\\\" or\\, \\\"hahaha\\, get it\\, that plot point is a wink to previous stuff.\\\" It adds little to no value to the story being told and in one instance the suspension of disbelief is completely broken by physical contact between spirit and living worlds all for the sake of a joke.\\n\\nIt took me a long time to star rate this film as I was genuinely torn as to whether I liked the movie or not. I settled on 2.5 stars\\, a middling score as three stars seemed to give off the implication that I liked more of what I saw than what I didn't which sadly is not true.\\n\\nIf you are a die hard Star Wars fan I encourage you to watch it for yourself\\, you may get more out of it than I did. But I left the film deflated\\, I'm beginning to worry that Star Wars as a franchise will never break from the cheesy\\, campy nature of the original trilogy (which was good for it's time in the 70's & 80's) not because it can't be gritty and compelling\\, but because the Disney chooses it not to be.","true":true}
