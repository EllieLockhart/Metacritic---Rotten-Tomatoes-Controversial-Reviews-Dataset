We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Nothing but feed women's empowerment..\r\rGraphics 6\/10 : I know\\, they are awesome\\, but it was the minimum that ND should do\\, game released on the last leg of the ps4 (ps5 was announced few later)\\, interact with the environment was a good point\\, break glasses\\, camouflage with the grass\\, but a lot of games had done it before\\, the high end graphics of this game was required\\, so there is nothing staggering about it.\r\rMusic 10\/10: Gustavo Santaolalla and the other people involved\\, was astonishing\\, impressive\\, perfect; Music keep you with tension\\, stressed and with the pressure of the situation and drives your feelings very well.\r\rMechanics: 6\/10: Nothing from out of the blue\\, nothing impressive a few improves\\, like prone\\, go across horizontal and vertical gaps\\, dodge enemy's attacks\\, nothing new\\, aiming is really BAD\\, stiffy as the part one\\, third person camera is so close\\, you'll receive at least 2 shots from an enemy flanking you in the time you turn the camera en locate the enemy\\, no improve from part 1 in that point\\, we can say that silencer was a good thing\\, but you could have done it before\\, like other games\\, crafting new menu\\, nothing helpful\\, just easier to manage\\, but all of this stuff could have done it on part 1.. So nothing impressive\r\rStory 3\/10: The worst part\\, at least 5 year of development and all you had was.. vengeance\\, a lot of stuff you had to write or invent and the only thing you came up with\\, was the doctor's daughter taking revenge.. So worn-out; More about fireflies\\, Tommy's story\\, Joel's story after his daugther death\\, infection\\, i don't know.. but use the same argument that every single action movie use\\, it is so boring\\, lack of bond with some characters; 15 minutes of cinematographic about a marijuana lab and rate a kiss.. SERIOUSLY? there was no hook.. All story was out of core of the game purpose; Uninterested dialogues from Dinah\\, Interaction with Jesse was like talking to a wall or talking to a NPC from a PS1 game\\, awful\\, basically Jesse was created only the get Dinah pregnant\\, and Dinah was only created to make a lesbian relationship and create a image of two moms and one son.. So poorly script\\, story and cinematographic\\, no hook\\, just trying to keep you attached with inconsequential stories from the game..\r\rThe game it is no bad\\, but we can give a high rank\\, cause we don't need another game from this franchise\\, we don't need story far away from the core\\, and this game it's a different tale\\, irrelevant\\, maybe if this game was named whatever but TLOU2 would it be good.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
