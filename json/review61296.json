Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"TLOU2 is a perfect example of an overly cocky studio trying to be woke.\r\rI at first thought their take on violence was very intuitive and new\\,but after completing the game I have to say that in theory it is great but poor in execution.\r\rBecause of their grueling take on violence the entire game is just grey and dark and frankly not fun to play.\r\rThe first game was the same but what drove you and gave you hope was the father daughter relationship of Joel and Ellie.\r\rThat very relationship that drove and was the silver lining midst the horrible world of The Last of Us\\,was stripped away from us in the first two hours of the game.\r\rThe real problem was the way they did it.\r\rSpitting on Joel\u00b4s corpse just seemed like Naughty dog were angry at the character and just wanted him gone.\r\rThen even worse you NEED to spend at least 10 hours playing as Abby\\,Joel`s murderer.\r\rYou are supposed to understand and sympathize with her because Joel was the \\\"real\\\" monster.\r\rShe killed him after he saved her.\r\rNot to mention how stupid they made Joel and Tommy\\,in the first game they were both super cautious and could spot an ambush from a mile away\\,and now when they are older and wiser they just gave out their real names to complete strangers.\r\rThroughout the game Ellie kills every person that was in the room when Joel was killed EXCEPT THE ACTUAL PERSON THAT DID THE KILLING.\r\rThe writing is sloppy at best\\,character motives are non existent and it is JUST A BAD STORY.\r\rNow the game play is great\\,the music\\,the level building the graphics all beautiful.\r\rMost journalists  are trying to pin the hate of this game to gamers being ant-trans or anti-LGBTQ when that could not be further from the truth.\r\rLook at The Last Of Us:Left behind DLC or at Life is Strange.\r\rFans simply feel betrayed\\, the thing that made the first game so good\\, destroyed in the first two hours of the game.\r\rRIP The Last Of Us\\,you deserved better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
