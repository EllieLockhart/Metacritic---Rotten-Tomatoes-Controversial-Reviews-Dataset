Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This might be the worst Star Wars movie... which is really sad becuase I liked the last two alot and had hopes Disney would keep the streak going.  Why?  Becasue of... buffoon Hux... cheesy Space Balls Poe lines... Princes Leia floating... Force Skype... and most notably would be the complete waste of Snoke as a character.  What did I like?  There were a few cool ship battles and BB8 seemed to be well incorporated.  I think this will be a well received movie by the non-Star Wars public\\, but fans are going to hate it.  Who's the primary villain in this movie... There wasn't one!","true":true}
