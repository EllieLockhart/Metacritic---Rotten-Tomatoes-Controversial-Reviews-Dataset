Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upgraded this review to one star because half stars and zero don't count apparently.\\n\\nPlease read elsewhere for the problems with plot\/characters\/bizarre scenes etc. All I'll say is this is an utterly charmless mess of a movie.  Painfully bad.","true":true}
