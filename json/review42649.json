Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was designed to destroy all previous Star Wars canon (including the Force Awakens)\\, and in that it has succeed spectacularly. Anyone who doubts my claim can look at the choices made in the movie. Favorite characters dying\\, important plot points from the previous film leading nowhere\\, plot holes everywhere\\, an idiot in charge of the Resistance after Leia is rendered comatose (Leia's force flight being the least egregious sin of this movie)\\, and so many other things wrong. Were this country ruled by Star Wars fans (of which I am not really)\\, Rian Johnson would be publicly caned for the crime of ruining Star Wars. I would say I'm surprised by the movie's high rating\\, but I'm not. Plenty of critics don't know their heads from their rumps when it comes to a good movie\\, and plenty of others are afraid to give the film a low review in case the Disney hit squad sues them into oblivion. All in all\\, worse than actual torture. If your torturer threatens you with this movie\\, give them what they want immediately.","true":true}
