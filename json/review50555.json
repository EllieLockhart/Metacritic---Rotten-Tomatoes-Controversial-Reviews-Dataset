Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2\/5. Acting was great though. As for the storyline\\, guessing they were trying something different and have opened up the option of sewing the seeds with future movies to correct and link up things. Better on 2nd viewing but just felt like all the events happened on the same day and within few enviroments. Too many silly moments wanted better after TFA and R1. Look at how LOTR 2 towers opened and the multiple storylines progressd together. Anyway off to bed cmon","true":true}
