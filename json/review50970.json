Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage that completely ignored Force Awakens\\, dismissed original stars and made me appreciate what Lucas tried to do with the prequels. Absolutely awful. Will never see it again and it left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I do not care to see Episode IX.","true":true}
