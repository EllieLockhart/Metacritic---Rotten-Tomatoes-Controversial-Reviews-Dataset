Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched it on a GTX Extreme screen. This only made the narrative and character flaws worse. There was a lot of work and talent put into the sets and visuals. Unfortunately\\, it is filled with fumbles of the narrative\\, pacing\\, and character development. It is like a dog turn filled with chocolate chips. There are good parts but they are not worth eating the rest of the dish. Anyone with stock in Disney should be mad at them for squandering the Star Wars IP. The movie should be rewritten and refilmed. It stifles marketability of current and future products. Like a tumor\\, it has made other products less appealing. This was someone's first Star Wars movie. I doubt it will even remain a popular movie to torrent. Its not worth the space.","true":true}
