Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tired of the hot takes on how the negative fan reactions are either (1) sexist MAGA fanboys flooding the review section to tank the film on purpose or (2) people who didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d what the film was trying to accomplish. I\u2019m a female fan and my main issues (same as most people I\u2019ve talked to) are that A\\, the plot was meandering and nonsensical (that casino planet\\, ugh\u2014the whole subplot was pointless)\\, B\\, the film elevated CGI over plot in a very prequel-esque way\\, packing the film with new spacecraft and aliens that made little sense in the story but would make great action figures (in what seemed like a classically Disney cash grab); C\\, that Rian Johnson took all of the questions that JJ Abrams so carefully set up and threw them in the trash (Who and what is Snoke? Apparently just some dude in a fancy jacket); and D\\, ended Luke\u2019s story by having him just magically disappear for no freaking reason. There were moments of the film that I loved\u2014most notably the Kylo arc\\, culminating in the red room fight scene where he and Rey fight an entire praetorian guard back to back\\, which was one of the greatest scenes in any star wars film ever\\, but they couldn\u2019t overcome the general weirdness and lack of continuity of the rest of the film. Where TFA captured the spirit of the original trilogy\\, TLJ captured the spirit of the prequels. Which is to say that it was bad.","true":true}
