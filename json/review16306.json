Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what movie the critics saw.  The film I saw was horrible in so many ways.  From the Princess Leia Marry Poppins moment in the vacuum of space\\, to the handling of Luke's character\\, in which everything he did was WRONG. The NEW characters have no chemistry and no depth.  There were so many things wrong with this film and the story.  A group of 8th graders could of come up with a better story line\\, and one that made more sense.  DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS\\, this movie sucks.  I give half a star for the CGI Special Effects\\, beyond that there is nothing redeeming with this film.  Good bye Star Wars.","true":true}
