Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I applaud Ryan Johnson for sticking to his vision. Beautifully shot and acted. The music is great aswell. However\\, at a certain point the movie decides to play it safe when I really wanted it to be bold. Still\\, a fun and exciting Star Wars movie.","true":true}
