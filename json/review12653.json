Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I come away from \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" feeling much the same way I felt about \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" but a little more. These movies aren't for me\\, anymore. The spectacle is great\\, the special effects are great\\, the performances are mostly great\\, but the written material doesn't work for me. The humour\\, the use of characters\\, even basic narrative structure. Every single creative decision\\, big and small\\, felt wrong\\, to me. Every part of this film is the opposite of what I find dramatically satisfying. It left me feeling somehow empty. Without hope for the future.","true":true}
