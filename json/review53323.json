Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created account to add my two cents about this movie.  I must say that I came out of TLJ with a new found appreciation for JJ Abrams. Sure TFA had it's draw backs\\, mainly from an originality point of view\\, but it was a fun to watch well made movie that set up some smart story arcs to continue the story with.\\n\\nWhat Rian Johnson did with TLJ is dumb founding.  He throws away all the set ups from TFA and begins to tell his very own\\, VERY BAD\\, story.  No need to go into every detail\\, that's been done and the list of things wrong with this movie is fascinatingly long.  In my mind nothing went right.  I've NEVER face palmed in a movie more than I did while sitting through this one.  There are no interesting characters left in this new trilogy.  They are either dead or written into irrelevance. Only Kylo Ren has any semblance of someone with conflict or purpose\\, but even he is just so all over the place it's hard to believe.\\n\\nEven with suspension of disbelief on over drive this movie is hard to watch.  It's that bad. Easily the worst entry into the series and one I'll never re-watch.\\n\\nThe biggest mystery in my mind is how Disney could allow the most valuable movie franchise to be under the complete control of such a poor and unseasoned writer\/director as Rian Johnson?? Especially after the great care they took with JJ Abrams to \\\"play it safe\\\" with TFA?? Especially after making such a great Star Wars movie as Rogue One?? I'm just dumbfounded.....\\n\\nI have no interest in the next main film\\, there's no saving this. I also have no interest in the Han Solo film...I'll be done with SW for a long time after this travesty.\\n\\nThe biggest mistake LucasFilm and Disney made here is believing for more than one second that they are bigger than Star Wars.  It's the fans who made Star Wars into what it has become\\, LucasFilm and Disney need to be caretakers\\, not use this powerful medium to push their own social agendas while simultaneously putting it into the hands of Rian Johnson\\, who clearly understands nothing of this franchise as he basically just pissed on fans from minute 1 (mom joke) to minute 150 something with Luke dying unceremoniously for no reason\\, after having 5 mins of positive impact in a movie supposedly all about him....some Last Jedi\\, indeed....\\n\\nForgettable movie at best....frustrating at worse.","true":true}
