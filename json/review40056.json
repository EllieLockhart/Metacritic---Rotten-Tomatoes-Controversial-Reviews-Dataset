Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first time ever writing a review about a movie... this movie was that bad. I would wait for a guy yelling dvd $5\u2019s. As far as the plot they went with running out of gas for about an hour and a half. Very lazy script writing. They clearly do not care about the quality of a great plot however the picture and Special effects were amazing. Kudos to those who worked on the sets \\, visual effects. I can understand why the acting was not up to par because they were not into this trash of a movie script. They weren\u2019t into the spirit of it.. no fire \ud83d\udd25 Save your money \ud83d\udcb0 also I wish I can give this no stars","true":true}
