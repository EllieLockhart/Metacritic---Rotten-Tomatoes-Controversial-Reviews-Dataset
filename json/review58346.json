Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Admiral Ackbar...with a whimper\\,  like some pedestrian after thought. Yeah\\, the new material was clearly meant to expand to the younger generation and profitable demographics\\, it's just sad that they had to pull the rug under the old fanbase by making most novels and comics and other lores non canon. I hope Disney reinserts them soon. It's like being stripped bare naked. Old fans have so little to cherish and remember about the Expanded Universe with this abrupt and rushed passing of the torch. More so is this true after the burning of the Jedi texts\\, sanctioned by no one else but a Jedi legend (conveniently) through Disney's orchestrations to ensure a clear path for its own Star Wars Universe. I look forward to having Luke serve as that Force ghost who has all the knowledge of the legends\\, myths\\, history\\, and lore in his head like a gate keeper and that we'll see more of him in future installments because clearly us old fans need someone we can hold on to with this SW franchise starship going lightspeed without the old guard.","true":true}
