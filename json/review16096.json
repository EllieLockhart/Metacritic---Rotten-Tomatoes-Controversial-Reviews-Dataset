Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a Star Wars fan so any movie in this franchise is going to get 3 stars... even movies with CGI amphibians.  The Last Jedi gets a solid 4\/5.\\n\\nThe ending of this movie is great and exactly what I hoped for.  A resolution to the stories of the remaining originals: Luke\\, Leia\\, Chewbacca.  The problem is that the film also needs to advance the story of the next generation: Rey\\, Kylo\\, Poe\\, and Finn.  And\\, it also throws in another one: Rose.  This confuses the movie in my mind and makes it harder to follow.\\n\\nI did appreciate a lot of the parallels with The Empire Strikes Back.  Questions of parentage answered (sort of?).  Jedi Training in a desolate place.  Massive battle on a white planet (salt... not ice) with an updated AT-AT assault.  These throwbacks were cool at first blush but\\, upon further review\\, seem to show a lack of creativity and formulaic.\\n\\nThis installment of the trilogy does little to advance the story; it just ties up or eliminates a lot of loose ends that were hanging around after mixing the stories in Ep. 7.  A tighter story more centralized on the new generation would have been better.","true":true}
