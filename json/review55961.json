Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took the \\\"Christopher Nolan\\\" approach to Star Wars with this movie\\, giving it a darker\\, more realistic tone and a complex plot filled with reversals and reveals. In doing so\\, Johnson has created a far more interesting and involving movie than J.J. Abrams' bubblebrained retread The Force Awakens and the sloppy\\, unfocused Rogue One. For the first time\\, audiences can have hope in the ongoing quality of Disney's Star Wars movies. The Last Jedi was much grittier and more realistic than anything we've seen before in the Star Wars film series. That took some of the fun away\\, in the same way Nolan's Batman films did not provide the same simple fun as the previous live-action Batman movies. But in exchange for that\\, we get a rich and complex experience that thinking adults can enjoy. Johnson makes almost all of the characters introduced in Episode 7 more developed\\, more believable\\, less cliched and less simplistic. He does well fleshing out the new characters he introduces too. Most importantly\\, Johnson succeeds at advancing Luke Skywalker's character into new and interesting areas. Compare this to The Force Awakens which actually regressed Han Solo's character into a boring retread of his original smuggler persona\\, giving us absolutely nothing new to think about. Johnson wisely understands that for a character to be heroic\\, he has to be tempted by the dark side and learn to overcome it. Mark Hamill gives the best performance of his career\\, aging perfectly into his role in a way that his original trilogy co-stars did not. One can only imagine how much more solid this new trilogy would've been from the beginning if a real artist like Johnson has helmed it from the beginning instead of the serial plagiarist J.J. Abrams.","true":true}
