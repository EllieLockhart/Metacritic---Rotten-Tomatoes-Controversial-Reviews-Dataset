Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To give the movie credit\\, it took more risks than its predecessor\\, Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe thing about a movie like this is that it's no longer considered JUST a movie. It's a phenomenon- a Force\\, if you will- much bigger than any one person could ever funnel into a short review.\\n\\nEveryone has it in their heads how their favorite characters think\\, look and act\\, and because of that\\, no director is ever going to make a film that will please everyone. It is hard to accept that these characters are not ours anymore\\, they are for the new generation of fans to grow up with. This isn't our Luke or Leia or Yoda\\, running around battling Darth Vader; if you want that\\, there are 3 movies already out there for you to watch any time you want. \\n\\nBut you can't have it both ways. As fondly as you may remember watching a New Hope in theaters oh so long ago\\, nothing is going to recapture that exact feeling. You can't have something new but also have the same exact thing at the same time\\, and we all have to learn to accept that.\\n\\nNow that is not to say this is a perfect movie by any stretch. There is a matter of pacing and direction with this film that smells of political influence- a certain casino subplot comes to mind- but it is not \\\"the worst Star Wars movie ever made!\\\" It is simply a new approach at the Star Wars brand.","true":true}
