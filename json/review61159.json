As an enormous fan of the first game and someone who grew to really connect with those characters\\, I was wary of the narrative this game created (particularly after reading some other fans\u2019 reviews). But after beating it\\, I really believe the studio did justice to all of the characters in the end. In the least spoiler way I can say - there is a period in the middle of the game where I legitimately wanted to stop playing because I didn\u2019t want to play as the character I was in control of. However\\, a couple hours later\\, I became really invested in the story and new perspective. Visually the game is stunning. Gameplay is incredibly solid\\, though it is quite violent at times. I\u2019m not a squeamish person\\, and I still found myself cringing at times. Overall\\, this game is truly an emotional experience that makes you THINK. So many diehard fans out there are saying that the studio has ruined their favorite characters\\, and I just really don\u2019t buy that. Just because the story didn\u2019t go the way you expected\/hoped based on your dreams of a sequel doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a perfectly crafted story with fully realized and developed character motivations. Play this game. Sit with this game. Experience this game. Don\u2019t let the negative reviews scare you away.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
