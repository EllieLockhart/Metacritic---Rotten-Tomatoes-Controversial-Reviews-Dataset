Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars\\, for me\\, has always needed three things - excitement\\, emotion and fun. The Last Jedi made me feel all three. I'd rather just leave my stuff and expectations at home and enjoy a Star Wars movie\\, be pulled into a story and enjoy it. Great job!","true":true}
