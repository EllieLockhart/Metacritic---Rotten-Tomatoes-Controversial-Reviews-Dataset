Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor sendoffs\\, marginalization of beloved characters\\, abandoned plot threads\\, totally far-fetched sequences (even for Star Wars)\\, totally ineffective efforts to make social commentary\\, and embarrassing attempts at comedic\/cute levity. \\n\\n\\n\\nNot the only imperfect episode\\, but certainly the only movie in the franchise I haven't found a way to love despite its flaws.","true":true}
