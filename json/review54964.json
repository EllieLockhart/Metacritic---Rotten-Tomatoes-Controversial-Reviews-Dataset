Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie\\, not a great one.  Overall I believe the good outweighed the bad but the bad stuff really were really big plot holes.  From characters being written completely out of character (Poe\\, Luke) to others having nothing real to do so they made up a very poor secondary plot that made no sense and didn't contribute to the movie at all (Re; Finn and Rose).  To having a major part of the movie not being realistic\\, even in this universe (Re: the whole space chase Battlestar Galactica style).  The good were the interaction between Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and even Snoke.  Too bad Leia wasn't in the entire middle of the movie.  I can understand the audience reactions\\, no matter how bad the critics and Disney are trying to spin the negative reaction.  It wasn't as good as the critics said but it wasn't as bad as some of the audience's.  A movie definitely needed to see a second time but not watchable too much after that\\, like the majority of Star Wars movies.","true":true}
