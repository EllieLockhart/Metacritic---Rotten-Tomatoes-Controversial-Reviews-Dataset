Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing Star Wars about this is the look. The story doesn't hold to the internal logic the franchise created over 6 films nor even to the first of the new trilogy. By now the plot holes have been accurately dissected six ways from Sunday by any thinking fan and the consensus is that this film makes no sense even on a \\\"children's movie\\\" level. Wait til Netflix has it.","true":true}
