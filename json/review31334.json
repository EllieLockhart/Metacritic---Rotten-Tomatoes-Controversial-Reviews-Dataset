Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good moments\\, however fails to deliver on anything set up in TFA in a satisfying manner. New characters are all pointless to the main story and the returning ones receive no development save for Kylo Ren. Just disappointing.","true":true}
