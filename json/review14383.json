{"101487":133325,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had fun watching the movie\\, but it isnt star wars. Its a superhero movie in the star wars universe\\, and honestly is spoils it. Lets start with why i think this is a bad terrible movie.\\nThe jokes: Jokes are always on every superhero movie\\, because everyone loves them and it makes you think the movie is better than it is. But the prank call in the beggining\\, wtf was that? ITS THE FUCKING FIRST ORDER\\, THE EQUIVALENT OF SP\u00c0CE NAZIS AND YOURE MAKING THEM LOOK LIKE LITTLE BITCHES WHO GET TRIGGERED OVER ANYTHING. But ok\\, lets move on past that.\\n\\nFinn's amazing trip to learn about capitalism: I didnt know movies had fillers\\, but TLJ showed me they have. Remember in The force awakens when Finn decides to fight Kylo Ren and be brave to go against the First order? Well now he is a faggot who wants to run away again\\, this doesnt add anything to the plot\\, its just an excuse to make him meet Asian Love Interest. Then they both run to Planet Capitalism and learn how terrible rich people can be\\, and *insert deus ex machina here* They find the perfect guy to do what they need - BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY REJECT IT\\, EVEN THOUGH HE IS THE BEST THEY CAN GET IN A PRISON CELL - but its ok because later *insert another deus ex machina here* He saves them\\, and so they go \\\"Well i guess you saved our lives\\, you must be good at infiltrating first order ships then\\\". \\n\\nMovie trying to be unpredictable: I like when movies do that\\, the twist that never passed on your mind\\, but this movie does that too much. \\\"OOH EVERYONE THINKS LEIA WOULD DIE BECAUSE CARRIE FISHER DID\\, LETS KEEP HER ALIVE\\\". Why? you could actually give her an awesome ending\\, She could be the last one piloting the ship. But since now nobody needs training to use the force\\, She can survive explosions and floating in space. Next is \\\"BET YOU DIDNT THINK SNOKE WOULD DIE ON THE MIDDLE OF THE STORY RIGHT? WELL HE DID\\\". Why? i mean it could be a good move\\, but theres a problem. We dont know anything about snoke. I dont know if he's a good villain or not\\, his motivations or personality. All i know is: he dies in a pathetic way and you dont feel anything because you never cared for him. You could say that Palpatine was almost the same thing\\, but Palpatine was always hiding in a cloak creating a suspense on the character\\, the fact that he was misterious was what made him cool. and the last one i can remember is \\\"YOU GUYS THINK LUKE IS GONNA TEACH REY TO BE A SUPER COOL JEDI LIKE YODA DID IN ep V RIGHT? WELL YOURE WRONG\\\" I get the \\\"master that does not teach anymore\\\" thing\\, and if its well made i like it\\, so we spend tons of time watching them on the island\\, Luke gives her 2 pages of information from \\\"The Force - For dummies\\\"\\, and rey goes \\\"fuck this shit i can learn all this on youtube\\\". Why?... Rey's abilities and skill with the lightsaber would actually make sense if she trained with Luke. \\\"But no\\, we gotta be unpredictable\\\". Also\\, have you ever heard the tragedy of vice admiral holdo? Well leia is in a coma or something\\, and Vice admiral holdo is the new leader\\, And our dear Poe doesnt like that. Then she starts to be a bitch for no reason. Why couldnt you say your plan? Nothing bad would've happened if you had just explained. But no you gotta look like the mean new leader who's gonna ruin everything. \\\"BUT GUYS WE HAVE TO BE UNPREDICTABLE\\\" So in the end Poe fails to take power away from her but its okay because she actually had a nice plan. And then she stays to pilot the ship.\\n\\nLuke's ending: When there were hundreds of shots beeing fired at look and he came out of that unharmed\\, i was like \\\"WOW\\, NOW THIS IS SOME AWESOME SHIT\\, LUKE IS GONNA SHOW WHY HE IS THE STRONGER JEDI THERE EVER WAS\\\". But no it was an illusion\\, and hey thats fine. Its less cool\\, but its fine\\, THEN HE DIES RIGHT AFTER. Remember when ghost yoda told luke to fucking \\\"TRAIN REY PROPERLY AND TEACH HER ABOUT FAILURE?\\\". \\n\\nPhasma: MAAAN I LOVED PHASMA\\, HER CONCEPT AND CHARACTER LOOKS SO AWESOME\\, and in awakening i thought \\\"hey they should give more screen time to her\\, she looks amazing\\\"\\, so i was expecting for that in TLJ\\, AND THEN SHE APPEARS\\, AND HAVE A 2 MINUTE FIGHT AND DIES IN THE MOST OVERUSED STUPID WAY EVER. I was like \\\"Of course phasma is going to use a grapling hook or something to get out of there and make a really awesome appearance on the next movie\\, after all the new star wars is all about strong and independent weman.\\\" but i was clearly wrong.\\n\\nBesides that i have a serious problem with a forced love insterest with finn\\, rey beeing more powerful than anyone for no reason at all\\, it seems that the force works on a totally different way in the new trilogy.\\n\\nIn conclusion: The end of that movie made me curious about nothing\\nLuke is dead\\nSnoke is dead\\nPhasma is dead\\nRey is super duper ultra strong\\nFinn doesnt get any development so i gave up on that\\nI love finn\\, i think his concept and character are great. I really liked him in awakening. But in TLJ he is just doing stuff that dont really matter. It feels like the director was thinking \\\"Well Finn is a main character\\, but what do we do with him? The main plot has no space for him\\, so lets put him on his own adventure - The Capital: A star wars story\\\".\\nAnd at last\\, Kylo Ren is now the boss bad guy.\\nAnd honestly kylo doesnt fit on the job. For the same reason that darth vader wasnt the ultimate bad guy in the original trilogy. Just think\\, would you put a guy of that age as your president?. He is a great Sith and Character\\, but sitting on a throne and commanding doesnt suit him.\\nTherefore i dont have anything left to see. To me this franchise is dead\\, its become a money cow and they will drain every niquel they can.\\n\\nBeeing really honest\\, this could be the best star wars there ever was\\, but some major mistakes plunge this film to the deepest of holes.\\n\\nI will give this one star\\, because Mark Hamill did one hell of a performance\\, honestly i expected much less from a guy who didnt even like the way his character was portrayed. He is the best thing on this movie.","true":true}
