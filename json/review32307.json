Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has a solid place in my heart as a connector to my grandmother who passed away a few years back. We went to see the Original Trilogy upon its release every opening morning. I skipped middle school classes to see Phantom Menace when it was released\\, and have lived with the lore of the Skywalkers for most of my life. \\n\\nTFA was okay to me\\, and I was willing to accept a change in the direction of these films\\, however TLJ is a disgrace and puts to shame everything I ever loved about Star Wars\\, good or bad. I would explain as to why\\, but all of the myriad of reasons have been covered at great lengths. \\n\\nDisney has scammed me long enough and will not get a single cent of my hard earned money in the future. Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose and Kylo can all go suck Mickeys shaft for all I care","true":true}
