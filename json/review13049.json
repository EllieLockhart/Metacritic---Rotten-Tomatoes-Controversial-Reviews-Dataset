Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't have the words. But if i did it would be a long string of curses directed at the film\\, and perhaps the director and the writing team. In my opinion\\, this film basically ruins Star Wars.","true":true}
