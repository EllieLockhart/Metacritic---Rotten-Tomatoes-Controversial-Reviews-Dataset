Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember being 13 and seeing A New Hope in 1977.  I was in Jr High\\, I was geeky\\, and it was amazing.  Episodes 1\\,2\\,3 were not great\\, but forgivable as they did not mess with my childhood.  I was more excited for The Force Awakens than I have been for any movie\\, since A New Hope; it did not disappoint.  Also\\, enjoyed Rogue One\\, the end of that movie gave me all of the feels.  The Last Jedi pissed me off\\, I spent the first part of the movie just irritated by all of the almost 3-Stooges-like antics and lines.  It got better after that and there were some amazing moments\\, and I will see it again\\, but overall\\, it was disappointing.  I do not believe any Star Wars movie needs to be deep but they went from being fun and witty and exciting to being silly replacing some of the wit with antics.  Leia was and is smart and clever\\, Luke always brooding but caring and brave\\, Han comic relief without being silly.  All of the new characters just seem to be too much and not enough.","true":true}
