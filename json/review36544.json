Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie gets two stars for the special effects and zero for the plot.  The story was awful\\, and it scrapped everything that was mysterious and special about the Jedi.  Everyone is now inherently awesome.  Dedication to study?   Pointless.  Years of training?  Don't need it.  Guidance from a wise mentor?  Absolutely unnecessary.  Just show up\\, waive a light saber a couple of times\\, and you are immediately the GOAT.  I think I am done with Star Wars.","true":true}
