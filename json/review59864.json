The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a masterpiece and a must buy if you own a PS4. I can't promise that everyone who plays The Last Of Us Part 2 will love it as the game has proved to be very divisive\\, however I have found the game to defy every expectation I held.

I can't promise that everyone who plays The Last Of Us Part 2 will love it as the game has proved to be very divisive\\, however I have found the game to defy every expectation I held. The story is a truly bitter\\, despondent and horrifying revenge tale that builds engaging characters only to tear them apart and put them through utter hardship. Emotional trauma\\, grief\\, moral redemption\\, violence and vengeance are all themes encompassed by the nuisanced story.\r\rFurthermore\\, the story is enhanced by gruesome\\, nasty gameplay that is weighty and down-to-earth. Each bullet feels powerful and destructive\\, and the brilliant display of gore with each headshot only accentuates the force behind each shot. The player can choose to sneak past enemies\\, pick them off with deadly precision or to rush headfirst into enemies and engage in gunfight. No matter which playstyle you prefer\\, each is made viable through the diverse range of weapons and trinkets at your disposal.\r\rWyoming\\, Seattle and the other locations which the player visits throughout the games 25 hour run-time are intricately animated. The breathtaking visuals are not only pure eycandy\\, but each location is also geographically accurate and mirrors its real life counterpart. It is awesome witnessing the decay of manmade infrastructure as nature restores itself throughout the city and pervades each building. However\\, there is a dramatic change in scenery with each level\\, giving each encounter it's own style and mood. For example\\, in one mission Ellie will be exploring the dank\\, and creepy\\, underground subway that is now host to deranged and grotesque Infected\\, however in the next level our heroine will be wading through the swampy marsh of what was once a freeway.\r\rSUMMARY - The Last Of Us Part 2 is a fantastic game with a heartbreaking story\\, breathtaking visuals and horrifying gameplay. Naughty Dog have sustained their position as a top-tier video game developer with this installement in the TLOU franchise\\, and although there seems to be many games coming later this year from promising developers\\, I struggle to see how they could match the brilliance of this masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
