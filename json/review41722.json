Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not the film your looking for. Move along rian johnson and learn how to spell your name. T.L.J answers no questions set up by the last film. Its too long. Crapy characters have way too much time wasted on them\\, and good ones are not in it enough. It has no consistency with other films and basicly makes no sense. The last jedi? Hated it!","true":true}
