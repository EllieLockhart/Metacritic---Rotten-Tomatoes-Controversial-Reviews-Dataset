Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a jumbled mess. Rian Johnson went out of his way to make everything unexpected. And\\, in doing so\\, made everything make little sense. All that was teased in TFA was thrown out of the window. It's as if these two movies aren't connected. \\nMoreover\\, VERY little time was spent on Luke and Rey's story\\, while way too much time was spent on the pointless Rose and Finn story.  \\nA complete and total disappointment. The only saving grace is the Luke Skywalker scene at the end.  But\\, overall\\, the way Rian handled Luke Skywalker was a joke. We waited nearly 30 years to finally see an uber powerful Luke. Instead we got a completely out of character person who in NO way resembled Luke himself.","true":true}
