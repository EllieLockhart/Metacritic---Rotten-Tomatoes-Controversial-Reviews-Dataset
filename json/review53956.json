Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am reposting my review after hearing 1\/2 stars don't count and I want my voice heard. I was wondering how it could still be at 49% when almost every review is 1\/2 star.\\n\\nFrom a fan of 40 years\\, this film was a travesty on so many levels. My biggest problem is making Luke a wuss. This same guy rushed off to the cloud city to fight Darth Vader and save his friends not even being a Jedi Knight but now that he's a master Jedi\\, he is a wuss and won't fight for anyone. He just wants to die. OMG!!!!\\n\\nA fan for 40 years and this chump of a director killed Star Wars for me in 2 1\/2 hours. If I ever see him in person\\, I'm going to punch him it the mouth!!!","true":true}
