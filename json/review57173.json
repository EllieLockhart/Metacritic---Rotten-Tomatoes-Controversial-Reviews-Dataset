Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the arguably the best Star Wars movie out of the entire series.  What most\\, who are focusing on this film's connection to the minutia of the SW lore of the other films\\, are seemingly forgetting is that as a movie it's an engrossing tale that pulls you in not only to the resolution of certain character arcs\\, motivations\\, and thoughts\\, but wows you with it's visual story-telling.  This movie also had the biggest stakes out of any SW film; you really feel that this may be the end of the entire resistance- a risk for the filmmaker that I think pays-off in a big way.  You never get that feeling from any of the other movies.  The character motivations are contrary to a lot of online fan theories and hard-core SW fans expectations\\, but I feel that the best movies surprise you with story beats and actions that are both entertaining and in-line with the story. And that what this does.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi pulls no punches\\, containing possibly one of the best sequences out of the entire series (throne room) and the best villain out of the series; a conflicted emotional Kylo.  The complexities of each character are great to witness and the chemistry between Kylo and Rey\\, Leia and Po\\, and Rey and Luke are engrossing. The script is not without fault\\, but the positives are so extremely fantastic that you can accept some story beats that may not be the most exciting parts of the movie\\, but hey- remember the entire Rathtar sequence in TFA? Even the Fin storyline that most are complain gin about has a goal for the story - Fin learns to not run from the fight any more; he becomes aware and determined to fight injustice by learning about the spoils of war.\\n\\nAnyways\\, I could go all day. This movie kicks a copious amount of ass.","true":true}
