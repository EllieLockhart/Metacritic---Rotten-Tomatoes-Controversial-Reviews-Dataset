Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad setups\\, gives bad payoffs. Gets a star for the CGI which is well made. Gets half a star for the soundtrack which is good but borrows heavily from the older movies in the franchise. The acting is probably the worst thing about this movie except for maybe the script. The pace is off as well. This movie is like if a fat old star wars fan got a 300 million budget and a politically correct script. 1\\,5 stars is almost too much. I think the prequels is at least filled with new ideas and much more creative decisions instead of rehashing the old starwars movies. And i would much rather watch the prequels","true":true}
