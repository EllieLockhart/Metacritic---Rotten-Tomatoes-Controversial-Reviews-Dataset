Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have loved the rest of the Star Wars saga\\, and are looking for a movie that is more of the same - that is not this movie. If you go in to this movie with an expectation of what you think should happen in this movie\\, you are probably going to be disappointed. This movie makes a break with tradition and charts a new vision for the Star Wars Universe. When the credits rolled at the end\\, I was initially disappointed - I had set my own expectations of what I wanted to see; what I thought the movie should have been. After reflecting over the past few days\\, I've come to appreciate some of the more subtle messages that this movie conveyed. One of the big ones that recurred throughout the movie was around the idea that going rogue and trying to be the hero on your own doesn't always work out - there are consequences! Was the movie perfect? Of course not. Was it a good addition to the saga? Absolutely. Many of the complaints regarding The Last Jedi were also relevant to other movies in the series - including the originals.","true":true}
