Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment. Ray is more powerful than anyone without training and she discover the force a week ago. Luke is a former serial killer who is living like an alchoolic on an island who die of an heart attack....\\nMarie popins fligh into space. \\nThe story is great\\, the bad guys waiting for the good guys to run out of fuel for 3 hours... Men are bad\\, money is bad and be nice with animals are the message of the movie. \\nOk star wars is dead. I never gonna see any Disney movie again and any movie with Ryan Johnson.","true":true}
