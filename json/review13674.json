Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I hadn't seen any other star wars movie I PROBABLY still wouldn't think this was an excellent film. There are some brilliant visually impressive moments and scenes. But THAT'S ABOUT it. The contrived humour ISN'T funny\\, some of the serious acting scenes are unintentionally hilarious and don't even get me started on WHAT THEY did to Luke Skywalker. The choice to give absolutely no point to snoke At ALL\\, the choice to make Rey basically nobody\\, the list of everything wrong with this film in terms of what it did with established characters is endless. Unbelievably disappointed ON THE whole. If THEY let johnson near another star wars film again they're not having my money. When Hishe can make a short parody cartoon that's better than the actual film that should tell you all you need to know.","true":true}
