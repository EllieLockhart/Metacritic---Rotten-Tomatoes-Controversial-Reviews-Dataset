Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insult to the lore\\, characters\\, and universe.  This film comes across as though it were based more on a fan-fic than an actual\\, proof-read script.  The inconsistencies\\, absurdities\\, and fallacies presented in this film showcase a blatant lack of respect and passion in this project.","true":true}
