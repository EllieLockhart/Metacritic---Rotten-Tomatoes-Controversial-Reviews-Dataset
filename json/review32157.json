Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*spoiler warning*this movie was an interesting roller coaster with ups and down but i must say it just didn't deliver might i add the movie hyped Luke Skywalker but he did nothing in the end it seems he was nothing but a distraction this is one of the many reasons why i believe this movies was a complete miss. Some reason i did not like this film\\n1 New characters from nowhere with bland personalities \\n2 rey became a powerful jedi without any training and beat someone who has trained for almost their entire life (Kylo ren) \\n3 Leia saves her self by using the force and everybody loses their crap but when rey with no training lifts up a mountain of boulders then it's whatever.ridiculous.\\n\\nI rate this movie 2 alpacas out of 10\\,whats up with rey and kylo ren.","true":true}
