Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fat ugly Chinese girl\\, Luke milking a sea donkey\\, A zoom of an iron. Daisy Ridley cheapest actress ever (suitable as an extra if you need someone with horse teeth). This movie was shallow and empty as a Transformer movie. No final battle\\, no orgasm. Mark Hamill was not master Luke from the Return of the Jedi\\, he was Leslie Nilsen from Naked Gun. Rogue One has professional actors\\, not a nerd from a call center.","true":true}
