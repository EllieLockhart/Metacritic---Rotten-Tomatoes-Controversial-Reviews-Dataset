Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Every character was OOC except for Kylo Ren\\, especially Rey and Luke. Would give it 0 stars if possible. Rian Johnson retire bitch.","true":true}
