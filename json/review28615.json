Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Production value-wise\\, looks great. But direction\\, story & characters arcs were developed poorly. It was a beautiful looking film\\, but one that is very pointless\\, dumb\\, and does not move the star wars universe in a good direction. I feel this is a more of a step back than anything else. I do not recommend to anyone to watch it in theaters and wait till it comes out on netflix or a cheap format.","true":true}
