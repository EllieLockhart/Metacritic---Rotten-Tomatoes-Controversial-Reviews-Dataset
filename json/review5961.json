Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing...poorly made ..fundamentally doesn't understand Luke and all the characters end up where they began\\,The look of this movie is on point.It fails at making me excited to see whats next.The problem of a non linear vision for this story is apparent\\, I am sad and disapointed.Please I can only hope that we can learn from this and JJ can put this beloved franchise back together.....","true":true}
