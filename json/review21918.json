Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw it for a 2nd time to fully pass judgement. I read it was bad b\/c of all the women aka p*ssified the franchise. Rogue One was a killer movie with a heroine so I don't think that was it. Laura Dern? The Asian chick? Leia flying like an angel or Peter f'ing Pan? WTF!? Mark Hamill who I have met on several occassions was great. Finn character falling over upon waking up - is he stupid or a fool? How does that fit into Star Wars? Oh he's human. No\\, it's dumb. His scene with chrome dome\\, everyone dies but she comes to kill him with that squad and only one fighter left in the hanger.  Ridiculous.  I'm done with this movie. It will stain the franchise moreso than Phantom Menace.  Next time\\, get a fan to direct or the guy who did Rogue One. Kathleen Kennedy wanting Leia powers\\, never ever suggest anything like that again.","true":true}
