Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie yet. There's no way I will be adding this monstrosity to my movie collection. Rian Johnson did his best to come in\\, ignore what Abrams set up in TFA and ruin everything that we have been told for the past 40 years. It's almost as if Disney made a deal to give him his own new 3 film Star Wars deal in exchange for him killing off the old characters so they could move on. As far as I'm concerned\\, this isn't even canon. I've wiped it from memory.","true":true}
