Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"why did everyone allowed this movie to be such a devastating blow to the star wars fans. every now and then a good scene but overall low quality of interaction between actors\\, acting\\, some scenes just felt like they fell from nowhere. if bond can have diamonds are forever then star wars can have this one !","true":true}
