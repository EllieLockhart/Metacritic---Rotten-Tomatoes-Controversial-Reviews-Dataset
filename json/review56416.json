Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The audience reviews have given me confidence that  Star Wars fans are finally realizing what I realized in my disappointment with TFA. The Disney crew has no new ideas for this franchise\\, or that the ideas they do have are laughably inferior to those upon which the franchise was built.\\n\\nThe remasters and the prequel trilogy proved that George Lucas had lost his focus on the point and the soul of the story. But Disney and JJ Abrams and especially perhaps Rian Johnson have proven that\\, even worse\\, they never really grasped any of that to begin with.  Perhaps they don't even care about it. \\n\\n What began in 1977 as a poignant story has been reduced to cheap brainless entertainment which blankly attempts to imitate the form and function of its substantive ancestor\\, but with only the most superficial and marginal success.\\n\\nLast Jedi and\\, in my view\\, even Force Awakens\\, achieve nothing more than putting a few familiar characters in front of us and giving them something reasonably interesting to do\\,  all in a world that is vaguely familiar to us. But neither movie individually\\, nor the two as a whole\\, add anything of value to Star Wars.\\n\\n I haven't really studied the overlap and differences between the personnel involved in making Rogue One and those involved in the mainline films\\, but I think it would be a good move to get rid of everyone on the creative teams of the latter two and replace them with Rogue One people.  The disparity in the quality of storytelling and in the story itself are striking.","true":true}
