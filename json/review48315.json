Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why rate it a great 5? Because half of these reviews are butthurt fanboys stating that the movie was \\\"not what they had planned for\\\" in their fragile little heads.  The movie on its own base was very fresh and original\\, giving some unique twists and removing a good amount of dead weight. Snoke is definitely a huge dead weight\\, a second-rate emperor that felt not only extremely CGI but also took lime light away from the good characters and events such as Kylo and the rebellion. Honestly\\, I don't like the hate this movie is getting from nothing less than fan-boy tantrums.","true":true}
