Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some great things in this film - cinematography\\, sound effects\\, and great acting (by Mark\\, Adam\\, Daisy\\, Laura). Some horrible things - poor choice of the major plot line to move the story\\, a 20 minutes subplot that could have been stripped from the entire film\\, some WTF moments\\, maybe too much forced humor\\, and some lazy dialogue in certain areas. The chemistry of some of the characters was great\\, but others just tried to do they best they could with what little they were given to work with.  I left the theater wondering if i wanted to see his movie again and if i honestly liked it. I'm still not quite sure.","true":true}
