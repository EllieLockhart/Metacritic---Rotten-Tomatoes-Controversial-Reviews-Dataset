Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There seem to be a lot of Disney haters out there. Frankly\\, I don't see Disney in this movie other than in the large volume of effects. What I liked: The characters that matter expanded their story. Finn had to separate from Rey to build some depth. Luke's character is interesting to me because he isn't what you expect. Gone is the positive kid with rash emotional reactions. To me\\, this movie is my second favorite Star Wars film. I didn't like everything about it though because at this point\\, I think my expectations are way too high. The lack of any Snoke backstory was extremely disappointing especially given his age\\, having possibly lived during the time of Palpatine\/Vader\\, and his dark side power. We also didn't see how he had managed to turn Ben while under Luke's tutelage. 1-3 are about Vader's creation. 4-6 are about his redemption. 7-9 is about Rey so far\\, but is it about Ben's redemption or is it about the fact that the force will always balance itself out? Does 9 end unbalanced and which side will be weaker going into 10? Given the 1st episodes\\, 9 should end with the dark side at heightened power. 10 - 13 would have to be about the next generation.","true":true}
