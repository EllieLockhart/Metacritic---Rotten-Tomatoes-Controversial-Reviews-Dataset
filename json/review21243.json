Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in exited\\,i laughed at the first joke\\, even when they dragged it too far and the laughter became a dry hehe\\, then came 2\\,5 hours of trolling the fans who looked for answers to TFA\\, who hoped to see an amizing Luke and a worthy finnish for Leia. im not seeing E9\\, they actually managed to kill star wars for me. i dont care if you call me a disgruntal fanboy who expected too much\\, first 5 minutes Luke fondles the balls of a space-cow and tosses his lightsaber like in a saturday night live skit.....yeah","true":true}
