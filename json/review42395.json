Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely fantastic!! I loved that Rey and Kylo were brought together by the force and the scene where they killed Snoke and his guards was so badass. I am really and truly excited to see episode 9. Although\\, I do hope to find out who Rey's parents are. And... will Rey and Kylo for a relationship?? Check out Vincent Vandetta's youtube channel. There is so much information on this topic\\, it is CRAZY!! #Reylo","true":true}
