Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know. I guess we have to wait to see what JJ Abrams does with episode 9 to see if he can redeem the story. at this point\\, Rian seems to have killed off all the magic of star wars for some unknown reason. maybe just to troll the audience? it's unfortunate.","true":true}
