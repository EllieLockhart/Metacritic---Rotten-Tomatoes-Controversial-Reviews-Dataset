Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the worst movie in the entire franchise. Seriously\\, save your money and rent it on redbox if you HAVE to see it. You will still be left with a feeling that you want your $2 back\\, as well as your 2 1\/2 hours. Disney is ruining this franchise and it's own credibility...smh\\n\\nWe want Lucas back!","true":true}
