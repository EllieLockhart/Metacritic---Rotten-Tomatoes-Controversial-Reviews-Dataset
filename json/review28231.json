Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written. Many subplots were not interesting and fell short. For the time gap between the previous movie and this one\\, characters have had major off screen changes that don't represent their change. Several characters left under developed. Many plot holes and contradictions throughout the movie that just leave the viewer more confused than invested in a sequel. Ending also fell short with no real catch to want to see a third. Story felt very long for the little that took place. Several subplots could have been avoided. End was also very lackluster. Felt like the ending of a series rather than a to be continued. Left the viewer with little to invest in for seeing a continuation of the story.","true":true}
