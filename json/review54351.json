Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never walked out of a Star Wars movie not wanting more\\, this is the first time I left a film with no interest what comes next.  Even in the prequels\\, Luca introduced weak or annoying characters but at the end of the fillm I still wanted to know what happens next.  At the end of the last Jedi\\, I really did not care.....  None of the characters were developed and it seemed like a Marvel movie where action and CGI is more important than a plot.  Maybe the problem is that Star Wars has gone corporate and there is no longer a strong visionary to hold it together.  Instead\\, you have a group of corporate executives demanding a formula that has worked in the past or for other movies.  The problem with that approach is that you lose the soul of the story.  \\nIf Disney wants to save this franchise\\, they should do what Lucas did to the Star Wars Christmas special and destroy every copy (Lucas was wise to recognize that mistake\\, admitted it and took action to correct it). Then bring back Lucas as an advisor that has full veto rights over anything that the Disney producers\/directors want to with the story and redo this mistake.  I have never written a review before.\\n\\nSo disappointing\\, makes me sad.  I also wonder how Disney got the professionals to like this film\\, Disney must really treat critics well.........","true":true}
