You are NOT ready for how dark this game will get....but like a good horror flick\\, it breaks the tension with moments of humor and levity (Cabin in the Woods\\, anyone).\r\rThere is a huge amount of replay value as the outcome is absolutely impacted by:\rYour ability to react to the QTEs\rThe decisions you make in navigating your character(s)\rThe dialogue choices you make....antagonize someone too much and they will get in the way of your survival\rHow much you explore....many of the clues and totems you find are NOT obvious and you have to take the time to poke around\rWhether you remember the premonitions offered by the totems\rI got five people out alive --  you better believe I am going to come back in a few days to try for seven (forget you\\, Emily)\rPeople knocking this game about how your decisions dont impact the outcome are so off target it isnt funny. The only issue I have is I am used to an inverted Y axis and you do not have that control option.  Otherwise I would give this a 10.  It is that good.  Of course\\, I am a horror game fanatic.  On the PS4 I have Outlast\\, the Whistleblower expansion\\, Alien Isolation\\, Evil Within and White Night (the weakest of the bunch). I will grab SOMA when its out.  Pls\\, if you are  a horror genre fan do not let this one pass you by or wait until a price drop.  It is worth the $$ and developers like this need to be supported.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
