Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me know when the kids at Disney want to make a real movie. Outside of Luke\\, that was extra cheesy. I cannot believe how bad that movie was\\, no action\\, no story\\, no great characters left\\, and I found myself laughing how stupid the scenes were (laser battering ram). They must have taken 20 lines from the first three films. I will never watch that movie again. Terrible the The Star Wars Saga has become. ","true":true}
