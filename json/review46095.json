Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. Random new characters\\,  then random new characters deaths. Movie feels soul-less. Lose of key characters had no emotional impact\\, as they were throw away events.","true":true}
