Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn\u2019t the best movie in the franchise\\, but everything with Luke\\, Rey and Kylo easily make up for all of its shortcomings. Mark Hammil is at the top of his game and steals almost every scene he\u2019s in. The sound design is awesome\\, the music is fantastic and the visuals are stunning! Moments in the film will stand out as some of my favorite in all of Star Wars. The movie does feel a little long\\, some of the storylines could have been cut out and I wouldn\u2019t complain. But every choice made by the characters (and some would say by the director) supports the message of the movie. We all make mistakes\\, even the best of us\\, It\u2019s how we learn from those mistakes and what we do after they are made that matter.","true":true}
