Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ tried a soft reboot with the force awakens and for the most part got away with it and set up some interesting questions and characters\\, Rian not just binned JJ's setups but also the lore the history and love that the original trilogy gave with this pile of space junk.\\nNo doubt he thought 40yr's on who will care. Maybe if he had ever watched the original trilogy and delved into the star wars universe he might of realised that the reason for the popularity of the franchise was that it had appealed to subsequent generations.\\n\\nHis poor use and butchery of Luke Skywalkers  persona was just an abomination. The film's characters for the most part just lacked any development while others were just pointless (Snoke). The Knights of who??? Captain silver dudette!\\n\\nThere was some beauty in the bile but this was mainly the visuals and in the end I don't feel that I have any interest in where the remaining characters development goes or what happens next\\, nor will I be chomping at the bit for the next two years\\, waiting for the next instalment.   \\n\\nDisney you clearly just want your money back and to be honest so do I please.\\n\\nNot so  long time ago in  a cinema not so far away Rian\/Disney just butchered the SW universe.......?","true":true}
