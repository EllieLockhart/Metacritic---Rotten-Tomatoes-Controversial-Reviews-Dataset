Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despise the reviews\\, I did go see it\\, it is a SW movie\\, how could I not! At first the movie\\, shoked me\\, surprised me\\, brought me sadness\\, and joy! Today\\, I went to see it for a second time\\, the pacing did not drag as much on the second viewing\\, and the subplots make more sense! Everything has a purpose\\, and I found out\\, that the more I see it\\, the more I like it! Do not get fooled by expectations\\, go see it with an open mind\\, forget what you know and you will not be disappointed! SWTLJ\\, is a solid movie! It breaks new ground and takes the story farther that expected! ","true":true}
