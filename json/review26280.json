Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the best part of the series\\, but definitely one of the better sci-fi movies of the year. Some dialogue was a bit off mark\\, and one particular Leia scene could have done a couple of more rounds in editing\\, but the character development and overall storyline progression was really well made! It really made me look forward to IX","true":true}
