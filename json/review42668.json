Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was everything I wanted out of it. I was bored in the Force Awakens because it felt like they were just repeating the same plot of old Star Wars movies. The Last Jedi is finally something NEW! If you are a die hard original trilogy fan\\, you will probably hate it because this movie doesn\u2019t dwell on the past. Get over it. I do think this new vibe is directed towards a younger generation\\, with similar comic relief to what is found in the new marvel movies. I grew to like every character a lot more\\, including Kilo Ren as a bad guy. Lots and lots of actions scenes\\, which is exactly what I wanted to see after there were practically no light sabers used in Episode VII","true":true}
