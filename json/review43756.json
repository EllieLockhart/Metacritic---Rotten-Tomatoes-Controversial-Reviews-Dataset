Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time and legitimate proof that Hollywood is no longer capable of telling compelling meaningful stories.  It was as if Rian Johnson hadn't even watched The Force Awakens.  \\\"The Lightsaber calls to you\\\"  - didn't matter.  Snoke - didn't matter.  Rey's parents? - Didn't matter.  None of these storylines were moved forward and instead were suddenly without much thought concluded in a flimsy manner.  This movie is the best evidence that Rian Johnson can't write and that Disney execs are inept at understanding what a real story is in order to stop such a travesty from happening.  Someone should be fired after this movie disaster and everyone at Lucasfilm needs to pick up a Joseph Campbell book as well as a course in Story\\, because this movie was flat out awful.","true":true}
