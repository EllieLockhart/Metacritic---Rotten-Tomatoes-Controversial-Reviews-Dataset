Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is very boring and is clearly not in the spirit of the franchise with useless new characters and no real movie development. I summarise it to be a mash up of \\\"Speed\\\"\\, \\\"Casino Royale\\\" and \\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\" with the jokes from \\\"Billy Madison\\\" all with the \\\"Star Wars\\\" logos. Not worth the effort.","true":true}
