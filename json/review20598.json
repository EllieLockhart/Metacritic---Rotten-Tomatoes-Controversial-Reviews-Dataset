Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never taken the time to rate a movie...but i cannot stop thinking about how bad  this movie is!!  I can honestly say I have no desire to watch the next one....someone really fu**** this one up..\u00f0??\u00a9\u00f0??\u00a9\u00f0??\u00a9","true":true}
