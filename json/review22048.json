Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just wish it made a better effort with the questions TFA raised. It felt to me like a reluctant sequel\\, as in the hand over was a burden\\, and didn't want to frame the story around the answers\\, which I get\\, but as a fan that's what I principally cared about. That and Luke Skywalker\\, whose character was very different from what I wanted. I came out of the last film counting the days to the next one. At present\\, I'm barely interested or invested in episode 9.","true":true}
