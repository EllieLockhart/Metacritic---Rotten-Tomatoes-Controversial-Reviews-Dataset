Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't see what the critics like about this film. Poor pacing\\, bad story lines\\, misused established characters\\, misused new characters.\\n\\nKilling off established characters\\, killing off newly introduced characters\\, the plot holes\\, my GOD the plot holes. \\n\\nThis movie has turned Star Wars from a cinema experience for me to a rental\\, and with the way critics are falling over themselves to not piss off Disney I'll never trust a Rotten Tomatoes score again.","true":true}
