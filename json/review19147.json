Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just meh. There's some good\\, some bad parts. \\n\\nRiann Johnson clearly hates Star Wars fans and has decided to ignore any criticism as being either (a) Russian bots or (b) sexist fan boys. \\n\\nSometimes bad writing\/directing is bad writing\/directing. Sometimes a character doesn't work. Deal with it. \\n\\nYour core audience matters. That doesn't mean you have to pander\\, but you can't intentionally alienate people either and hope to succeed.","true":true}
