Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has a handful of very good moments\\, but it's all overwhelmed by a tedious plot and inappropriate Avenger-style humor. The bulk of Plot A is basically the sci-fi equivalent of a slow car-chase scene\\, where the good guys can go 40MPH while the bad guys can only go 39MPH . . . but the bad guys have a fuller tank of gas so eventually they know they'll win. Oh\\, the excitement!\\n\\nBut Plot B\\, involving Luke and Rey\\, is where my true interest was at\\, and where the story failed the most. I was hoping we'd get a little insight into the origins of the Jedi and their beliefs. Maybe a scene where Rey is reading the books and making discoveries. Instead we get to see Luke teach her how to meditate for a few minutes.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi really is a case of blown opportunities. The best parts involve the relationship between Kylo and Rey. There's a lot of potential there. Snoke's fate could be seen as a bold choice\\, but to me it felt more like Johnson simply not knowing what to do with the character and washing his hands of it.","true":true}
