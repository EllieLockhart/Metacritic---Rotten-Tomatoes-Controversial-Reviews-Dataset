It's a good game if you like story\\, (however disjointed at times it may feel)\\, it's also a good game if you like beautiful graphics and pretty good mo-cap.\r\rIt is not a good game if you value gameplay. This is an artistic piece through and through. I played it and don't regret it one bit. I won't however\\, be playing it again.\r\rThe game starts at a pretty decent pace and without spoilers\\, will dig it's meaty claws into your shoulder and will not let go. It's full of horror tropes you've come to know and love\\, (people going alone\\, things that go bump etc...). For the most part you may not care about the characters as much as you led to believe by the butterfly effect system.  I saved 4 people on my playthrough\\, but knew I was damning a few and didn't really care. I wanted to see it finished.\r\rThe first half of the game is where it's strongest. You have no idea of what is going on and it makes for some tense creepy moments. It borrows heavily from various horror franchises\\, but yet seems to be it's own. In between each episode you see a piece with Peter Stormare\\, that is pretty well done. It's beautiful and it works well.\r\rThe failing begins during the second half of the game. At this point\\, the plot\\, (again without spoilers)\\, takes a heavy turn and it's not for the best. Imagine watching a slasher flick that suddenly becomes a supernatural romp and you get the idea. It almost felt as if the writers had painted themselves into a literary corner and now were looking for an out.\r\rFor those who say all it is\\, is QTE; it isn't. But it does rely heavily on the QTE button presses for some of it's scenes. The problem here is that failing some of these QTE doesn't always end badly. For a game that has no compunction with death\\, it seems a little out of place. Sometimes the failing of the QTE can actually be helpful.\r\rThe sound design in this game is a definite strength. For jump scares\\, use headphones. You won't regret this part at all.  The character designs are well done and the Mo-cap is really well implemented...to a point.\r\rSome of the animations when the characters are talking seem really wire-framed and limited in motion.  There is little in the way of true gameplay here. You walk\\, you look at shiny objects\\, you pick things up and you QTE certain areas. That's about the gist of it.\r\rOne major gripe is how the camera can shift when you are walking in one direction. Effectively this can change the direction you need to press to be able to continue in the same direction. It's reminiscent of Resident Evil in that way.\r\rThere are multiple endings in the game\\, which can be altered via the butterfly effect. Admittedly I only played through once\\, but I have no desire to go through the game again. Yet somehow\\, I doubt the game itself up until the end point changes very much\\, which is a shame. It would be nice to see that if Character A dies and I let Character B live that the game is very altered. All in all though the butterfly effect just doesn't seem to have wings. It's just a caterpillar still on the ground.\r\rSo if you are looking for a game heavy with story\\, this may be for you.\rYou want a roughly 7-9 hour long interactive movie\\, pick it up\\, but I'd wait until it is down to the $20 mark if I were to be honest. I paid $40 and it still felt like too much.\r\rI gave it an 8\\, because for what it is and what it tried to do\\, I thought 7 was too low. If I could even though some people don't like half marks\\, I would give this game a 7.5\u2026 Expand","true":true}
