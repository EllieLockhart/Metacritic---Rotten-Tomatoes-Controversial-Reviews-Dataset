Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well now STAR WARS is dead......I had so much faith about Ryan Johnson and he disappointed me.i will never forget what \\\"Disney-Lucasfilm\\\" planned or what are actually going to do with this raped saga.AND THEY CALL IT STAR WARS!!!WE CAN SEE THAT DISNEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT STAR WARS MEANS!!","true":true}
