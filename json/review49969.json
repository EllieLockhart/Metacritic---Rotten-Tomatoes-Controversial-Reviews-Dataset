Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You never want to leave a Star Wars film with \\\"What the hell did I just watch?!\\\" And yet here I am. This installation gives us zero progress\\, and instead simply undoes some of the better pieces introduced this side of ROTJ. Aside from some really interesting (in the bad way) plot choices\\, poorly timed attempts at humor\\, really strange MacGuffins and confusing motivations\\, there's also the overwhelming feeling that everything about Ep VIII brings us backwards\\, and that the 2.5 hours spent in the theater took us pretty much nowhere\\, and accomplished next to nothing\\, aside from unraveling some of the things the universe has spent decades building.","true":true}
