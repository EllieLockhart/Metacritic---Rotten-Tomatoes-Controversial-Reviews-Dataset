Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie that follows and expands on the original trilogy. I saw it twice in cinemas and I definitely would have gone again.  There were some great scenes with amazing special effects that drew the viewer in. It definitely made me ready for next and last instalment in this trilogy.","true":true}
