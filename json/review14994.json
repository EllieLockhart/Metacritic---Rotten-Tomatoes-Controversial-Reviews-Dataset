Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just watched the movie yesterday and I absolutely love how the film is exploring the characters of Kylo Ren and Rey. I also love the message of the movie\\, where they're deviating from the classic (cliche) good always triumphs and evil will always be defeated\\, where balance is needed. I might watch it again in the cinemas if I have time to. There are some scenes where it tries hard to be funny though.","true":true}
