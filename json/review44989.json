Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Umm wow.  Ok don't listen to all the nonsense of would-be home critics here.  I had expectations going into this movie with some predictions of expanded universe.   Not only was I really wrong\\, but I was pleasantly surprised.   Few plot twists\\, humor\\, grand scenes and spare no expense on character direction....  Anyway\\, if you go in expecting another rehash of the old movies\\, forget it.   Questions hang and they do a good job keeping you wanting to see what happens next.","true":true}
