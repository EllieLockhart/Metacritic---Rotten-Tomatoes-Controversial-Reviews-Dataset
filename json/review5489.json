Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed starr wars theories\\, wasted so much opportunity and then we got God Leia?!? What was the whole idea behind The casino world and the horrible Hacker character? \\n\\nI bought the Blu Ray to watch again to see if I would change my mind\\, I do like small bits of the filmfilm\\, I will watch it again with my family but its a terrible waste of the franchise and a complete disappointment. I feel sorry for Mark Hamill\\, he saw this coming and his character was ruined. :(","true":true}
