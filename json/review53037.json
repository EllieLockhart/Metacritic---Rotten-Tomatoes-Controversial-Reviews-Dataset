Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As Luke says in the trailer\\, this is not going to go the way you think. Rian Johnson could have done the lazy thing and continued to retread OT story beats. Instead\\, by the second act\\, it's clear this isn't that kind of movie. One thing it *does* have in common with Empire\\, though\\, is failure. Nearly everybody in the movie makes a massive error at one point or another\\, and reaps the consequences. The movie also has things to say about war profiteering. Rose Tico has a big role in explaining this--newcomer Kelly Marie Tran shines. Taking off a half-star because it dragged a bit in the middle. But if TFA was a remix\\, TLJ is a reinvention. It's a shame Johnson isn't doing IX.","true":true}
