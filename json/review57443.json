Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great! People say it's a copy and paste star wars movie but it had a completely different story and had great twists that made you think. Saying thispvie was  the same as a new hope or as empire because they break on board the enemy ship is like saying that an oven is a toaster 'cause it heats things. This movie was great and made for a fantastic sequel. We saw growth in characters and we learned once again that the star wars saga isn't about the rebelion and the empire\\, it's about the characters. It's about Kylo and Rey\\, the rest of the movie's just a frame work for their story like the first two prequels we're for Anakin.\\n\\nIt was great. 9 out of 10","true":true}
