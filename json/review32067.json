Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\n\\nLuke Skywalker is reduced to a quivering imbecile who attempts child murder of his sleeping nephew to point of brandishing a lethal weapon above the child's head but is too much of an indecisive goon to even get killing a sleeping child right.  If this sounds like the nexus of a good Star Wars movie to you then you may indeed enjoy The Last Jedi. \\n\\nThe movie also some how makes a spaceship chase boring as apparently now all Star Wars ships can only \\nmove at a maximum speed of yawn.....until they run out of gas. \\n\\nAll the characters seem to work really hard at making you not care about  what happens to them next. So there is no point mentioning them. \\n\\nPlot holes? Sure. Inconsistencies? Sure. But who cares. This movie hates itself to the point of not even caring what it looks like when it goes out in public. \\n\\nSome sort of space cat giraffes were saved and that made the whole thing worth while.","true":true}
