Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was nervous when Mark Hamill said that he \\\"fundamentally disagreed with every decision\\\" that Rian Johnson made concerning his character; now I understand why.

It feels like Rian Johnson wanted to throw out everything JJ Abrams\\, Lawrence Kasdan\\, and Michael Arndt helped set up in TFA\\, and claim that by doing so\\, his writing decisions were \\\"bold\\\". I truly have little interest in seeing Episode 9.","true":true}
