Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi destroys the world that JJ Abrams creates in \\\"force awakens.\\\" \\n\\nto rehash \\\"empire strikes back\\\" is a poor move and shows that the director knows nothing about the lore of star wars if he and the creative team cannot make an original story arc.\\n\\nthis is the first movie I my cell phone to see what time it was and also the first movie in a long time I was tempted to walk out on. \\n\\nMovie is poorly paced and does nothing to explain why new characters are so powerful in the force. \\n\\nDirector clearly has no idea how to use older characters and no idea how to use modern characters without adding bogus plot devices to include new characters into story. \\n\\nIt is difficult to review this film without \\\"spoilers\\\" but on this last note- the opening act with \\\"poe\\\" vs the \\\"destroyer\\\" ; had the director actually look up the lore of star wars he would have known that \\\"Destroyer Class frigates\\\" are no bigger than the rebels \\\"corellian corvettes \\\" and the idea that a \\\"destroyer\\\" is a fleet killer is absurd. \\n\\ni am afraid to watch the third installment of the \\\"new\\\" star wars\\\" and would rather wait to pay a dollar to rent it.\\nplease disney do not allow amatures to create future \\\"star wars\\\" properties.","true":true}
