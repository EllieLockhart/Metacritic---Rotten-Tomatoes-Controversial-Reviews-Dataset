Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined the storyline The Force Awakens set up. Ruined Luke Skywalker's character.","true":true}
