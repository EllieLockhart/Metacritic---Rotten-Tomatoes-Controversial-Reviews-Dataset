Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cannot understand the hate some people are expressing for this movie.  Saw it yesterday and let it sink in over night.  LOVED it.  Much better than TFA.  Not without its flaws\\, however.  (Looking at YOU\\, Finn\/Rose storyline.)  \\n\\nTHAT Leia scene makes sense if you think about it for more than 10 seconds (she's a Skywalker and it was a life or death situation).  \\n\\nLuke is whiny?  Luke was ALWAYS whiny!  \\n\\nRey's parents aren't powerful\\, so it doesn't make sense why she's so powerful??  Anakin Skywalker would like to speak with you.\\n\\nStar Wars is being ruined by SJWs?  Go back to your parents' basement.  \\n\\nDisney paid off the reviewers and that's why it got such positive reviews??  What\\, did they pay ALL of them?  And reviewers are all so universally corrupt that they all accepted and NOT ONE of them revealed Disney's deceit?  \\n\\nClassic case of a small minority coming out in droves to try and take a dump on things other people enjoy.  And you STILL couldn't get the movie below a 50% user rating.  When you want to hate something so badly\\, you'll find reasons.\\n\\nRian Johnson made a great film.  Not perfect.  But great.  It is NOT a prototypical Star Wars story.  Unexpected things happen.  It takes risks.  And it's worth seeing.","true":true}
