Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Propably the worst star Wars movie ever...\\nI really love the Star Wars franchise but the two new movies are actually making me cry... They are just remakes of Episode IV - VI but with stupid extras. Need an example? Well if you want to be a jedi and fight a sith and his guards what would you need? Years of training? A high amount of midi chlorians? No... You just have to be a girl that never even heard about jedis. Then you have to find a lightsaber and spend one day with Luke Skywalker. And you `re ready to go... Star Wars is great. But do we have to kill it with politics? This SJW nonsense is even more unrealistic than Star Wars itself. Oh and btw.. The movie even didn`t manage to be what politic wants it to be... Because the generals Leia and Holda are trying their best but it seems like every decision they make makes the situation worse for them...","true":true}
