Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignorant to the lore which is the essence of the its continuous success\\, full of plot holes\\, does not understand the core of its original fan favorite characters\\, full of plot holes\\, and continuity issues\\, too many characters\\, pointless stories\\, nonsensical twists\\, shocks and story ending\\, dumb love twist\\, too many unfunny silly jokes\\, non-logical story and killing of great potential characters and killing off the biggest cash money character everyone wants to see more off.... Luke Skywalker. Well I thinks I will stop there.","true":true}
