Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sorry to say\\, The Last Jedi was extremely weak. It could possibly be the weakest film in the series. The acting was horribly wooden\\, they developed all the wrong characters\\, they broke rules of the beloved mythos\\, and they used deus ex machina to solve nearly every conflict. The worst thing about this is that Disney is going to make a killing on this movie so we will get more of this trash next year and the year after until the cows already tender udders fall clean off.","true":true}
