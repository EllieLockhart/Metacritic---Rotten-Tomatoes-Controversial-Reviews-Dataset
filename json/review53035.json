Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone movie\\, it was enjoyable enough; Awesome CGI\\, fun story\\, lots of action. As a Star Wars film\\, it was poor. A strong plot and interesting characters is what made the originals so great - this was lacking in both. Appears to be written by someone with about as much knowledge of Star Wars lore as their apparent knowledge of simple physics in space. Some highlights (SPOILERS): Poe and Finn did zero useful things\\, Finn goes on a plot-pointless side adventure with his new girlfriend\\, General Leia overcomes direct exposure to the vacuum of space using magic *ahem* the force\\, Luke Skywalker whines for half an hour then does some useful stuff at the end as a hologram using magic (I mean the force) before leaving the world unremarkably\\, Kylo Ren becomes a slightly less-conflicted wimp\\, Rey continues to master the force and be perfect with little actual training\\, the First Order continues to produce more ultimate weapons that are overcome by conveniently simple means\\, a spaceship destroys other spaceships by hyper-spacing through them (gee why didn't they just do that every time?) and bombs are dropped... in space.","true":true}
