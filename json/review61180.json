Characters should be defined by what they do not a small part of who they are. Not to mention the new characters are just terrible\\, their acting is fine but the characters are just annoying. To top it off the overuse of time jumps makes things fairly confusing. Only parts of the story I can say I genuinely enjoyed where the parts with ellie and joel other than that avoid this game so maybe in the future creators will focus on making good games people want to play as opposed to sjw crap. If we stop buying they'll stop making simple as that.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
