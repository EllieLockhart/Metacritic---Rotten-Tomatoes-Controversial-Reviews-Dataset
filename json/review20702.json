{"101487":146169,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited two days just to see if my opinion of the movie would change... nope. Rian Johnson went a totally different direction with this movie and it was just ultimately disappointing. I understand that he wants to be a creative guy and make it unique\\, but he shouldn't have done that with this series. Make Looper 2\\, 3\\, 4\\, 10\\, I don't care. In interviews he says that he is a fan\\, but after watching this movie I cannot fathom how a fan would come to create something this terrible. The plot holes were the most difficult to get over. It was just lazy writing to the core\\, and it was covered up with pretty graphics and CGI. Fans have been begging Star Wars and Disney to develop these characters\\, give us story\\, give us something. Instead Rian Johnson went through with a hatchet and butchered it. Leia floating through space\\, knocks on the door\\, falls right in... what drugs were you smoking when this became a sound plot point? I think what really pissed me off though was how Rian and Disney ruined Luke Skywalker.  Star Wars fans have been waiting YEARS for something\\, the writers could have gone 10\\,000 different directions. Instead they did nothing! Rian and Disney squandered this opportunity\\, and left me feeling totally cheated. If there was just one reason that killed this movie (and there are many)it would be this. The 93% rating from critics is also a total joke\\, I agree everyone is entitled to their own opinions\\, but take a good long read at the audience reviews and you will get a better picture. A few other reviewers have mentioned the YouTube video \\\"Top 10 Reasons Why The Last Jedi Made Me ANGRY!\\\"\\, these guys are right on point. I went into this movie looking forward to where Disney was taking everything\\, and I didn't want to be negative about it. I wanted another successful movie\\, another stepping stone into the star wars universe. I was sadly disappointed.\\nDisney - You need to get your house in order\\, because if you tank the Han Solo movie you will kill this franchise. You did how many reshoots for Rogue One to get it right\\, why didn't you take the same level of responsibility with this movie? You need to get back to the basics\\, get the writers of Rebels\\, Rogue One\\, whoever you need to get to create a cohesive plot that is actually based in the star wars universe. You are Disney for God's sake\\, stop complaining about the rotten tomato's scores and accept that this movie is terrible. You gave Rian enough rope to hang himself and he surely didn't disappoint. Next time throttle him back a bit\\, and provide some type of story oversight so that we get something that makes sense. Make it happen Disney!\\nRian Johnson - You are clearly a successful writer and director\\, but you missed the mark on this one. The reason star wars was so iconic is that they successfully built and expanded off of the previous material. You practically ignored it\\, and that's where you lost the fans. Since you already have the deal for 3 more movies you have a lot of ground to make up. Please don't do this again.","true":true}
