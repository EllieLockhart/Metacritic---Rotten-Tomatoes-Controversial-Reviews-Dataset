Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked Force Awakens but this one was disjointed and lacked heart. Good action scenes but story was weak and little character development. All over the place. Left me wondering how Abrams is going to fix the mess he's been left with in the finale.","true":true}
