{"101487":166876,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Short non-spoiler review - Ok film\\, but a big disappointment.  Save your money to the DVD or Blu-Ray release. \\n\\nSPOILER REVIEW\\nThe reason why I am so disappointed is just how many plot holes and half-thought through ideas there are. I can look beyond them if the film is really good or fun (e.g. Star Trek and the whole red matter nonsense) but when the film is sub-par any mistakes\/issue just become massive beacons\\, especially when they dont make any sense compared to previous films.\\n\\nWHAT WAS THE PLOT? - So since Ep7 we are told that the First Order (FO) have taken over the galaxy\\, despite Starkiller base being destroyed\\, and they are hunting the last Resistance fighters. And at the end of the film the bad guys are still chasing the good guys. Wow\\, that was interesting.\\n\\nWORLD LONGEST CHASE - This part of the movie takes up almost two thirds of the film and is dull. Plus as ships can come and go as they please any tension is lost by the chase. Also why not just send one FO Star Destroyer slightly ahead at hyperspace and then catch up with Leia's ship? No\\, lets just chase them until their fuel runs out. \\n\\nSTAR WARS MEETS PIRATES OF THE CAIBBEAN - Why do lasers in Ep8 dip and arc like 17th century cannon fire in this film (when they never did before)? Why also do disabled or destroyed ships sink like they are in the sea? Also why do bombers 'drop' bombs in space?\\n\\nSNOKES SCARY BIG SHIP - They introduce Snoke's big ship\\, the Supremacy\\, but apart from size what is so scary or threatening about it? The Death Star was a fearsome planet killer\\, StarKiller base also was a clear threat to the galaxy\\, even the Dreadnought at the star of this film seemed quite dangerous\\, but all Snoke's ship can do is chase Leias ship at the same speed\\, fire lasers that are more like cannons in the 17th century\\, and gets cut in two by a far smaller ship at the end. Pointless.\\n\\nHYPERSPACE DEATH MOVE- So a Resistance ship\\, piloted by a purple haired admiral we just met\\, can wipe out a far bigger FO ship by hyper spacing into it. Why couldn't one of Snoke's spare Star Destroyers he had just hyperspace into Leia's ship rather than chase it for 1 hour?\\n\\nAlso as this is clearly such a powerful tactic why don't other Resistance ships just constantly take out massive Star Destroyers using this tactic? After all\\, you only need one semi-competent person to fly a ship according to this film. Porkins in his X-Wing could have just hyperspaced into the Deathstar in Ep4\\, and Lando could have hyperspaced the Falcon into the Deathstar 2 in Ep6. If you are going to introduce an all powerful move at least the producers should think it through.\\n\\nSUPERWOMAN - Oh dear\\, that scene where Leia floats through space is simply cringeworthy. Also we all know Leia is force sensitive but she has basic powers. Yet she single handedly becomes the most powerful user that ever lived by coming back to life\\, in space\\, and flying herself to safety. And when they are trapped on the planet later she is unable to move some rocks until Rey shows up. \\n\\nYODA IS NOW A GOD - Yoda is so powerful a Jedi now that he can also cause storms and lighting bolts even from the dead. So between Ep3 and 4 why didn't he just wait for Emperor Palpatine to be walking down the road before striking him down with a storm? \\n\\nSNOKE WHO - we had a villain\\, who clearly would never match Palpatine in evilness\\, but he was interesting. Plus we wanted to know what his plan (if any) was. Then he is killed off with little explanation or answers on anything. Also why did Snoke's character have to be CGI or done by Andy Serkis when he doesn't actually do anything but sit in a chair? \\n\\nMORALS - Rose\\, the new character\\, doesn't like the planet they visit as its full of rich people getting richer through war profiteering and slavery. That is meant to have some deep and meaningful insight into her character? Surely most Resistance fighters would share her view\\, so why is Rose so special here?\\nThe biggest moral statement in the film\\, but is glossed over in 5 seconds\\, was DJ's point that the Resistance are hypocrites and there are truly no 'good guys' given they also use the same war merchants to get their arms. Shame that point wasn't expanded further\\, but then I guess the point would go over most kids heads.\\n\\nLUKES END - He force projects to Klyo Ren on the planet\\, and then dies with no explanation back on the island. He may as well have flown to the planet and done a Obi-Wan disappear force death with Kylo Ren than this really weird death scene. Also Luke's death is so 'meh'\\, which is a shame given he is such an important part of these films.\\n\\nBATTERING RAM - Snoke's ship has been cut in half\\, but don't worry guys we managed to save the big battering ram! Also good job the FO packed one in the first place. Snoke couldn't foresee a lightsabre turning by his side but he did have the foresight to pack a battering ram to a space ship chase!\\n\\nREY - What was the point of her entering that dark butt hole on Luke's planet? It is clear now that Disney simply do not have the guts to make Rey turn to the dark side\\, given they want every hero in films to be a woman now\\, so her flirting with the dark side is a waste of time. I'd rather see more Kylo Ren being tormented and torn between the light and dark.","true":true}
