I have no problem with Ellie being lesbian (OBVIOUSLY - it was established in the first game and i enjoyed the dlc) but Naughty dog clearly has an agenda... there are bigots\\, a weird cult that dont like trans people and other than that adds nothing to the story (apparently 30+ years into a tragic apocalypse people are still obsessed with gender and sexuality) The male characters are useless\\, killed\\, crippled or pushed aside.\roverall: 1\/10 its a sequel to a heavily story based game ( which could have easily worked as an interactive movie but shoehorns in boring\\, repetitive combat and awful platforming ) and this game completely **** on the characters and themes of the first for a preachy revenge plot that dosent even END! Dont buy if you even appreciated the first Game!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
