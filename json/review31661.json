Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorely disappointing\\, given all the hype around it. Utterly disappointing lack of respect to the character development over the decades. Not advocating for fan service\\, but seeking renewal in storytelling shouldn't come at such an extreme of throwing out the baby with the bath water.","true":true}
