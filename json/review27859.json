Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal movie! I absolutely loved this Star Wars. Every question answered\\, except Snoke. But overall 100% in love with The Last Jedi! Rian Johnson definitely took Star Wars Into a great direction. I feel all the bad reviews are due to them either not paying attention very well\\, they expected too much\\, their theories we're wrong\\, or their character wasn't the main center of attention anymore.  So definitely go see it and when you do keep an open mind!! And stay away from the negative reviews.","true":true}
