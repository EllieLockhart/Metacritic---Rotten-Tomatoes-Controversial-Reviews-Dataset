Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was fantastic.  There are few for hard fans who have read more novels\\,played more or the games\\, or have been immersed in the universe of star wars then me.  A lot will complain\\, because the movie did not happen the way they thought it would\\,should\\,ought to go.  Do not listen to that trash!   This movie was an absolute masterpiece.  Everyone complained about the force awkens because they said it was a rehash of episode iv.  Now those same people are upset because Luke's story played out differently then how they imagined.   I was moved by this movie.  It was a emotional rollercoaster\\, and I could not see the turns.  I never would have pictures this movie in my nerd ridden dreams.  That is why it is a masterpiece.   5 stars","true":true}
