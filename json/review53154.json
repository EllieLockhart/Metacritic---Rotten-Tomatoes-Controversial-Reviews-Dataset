Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A wonderful sequel to The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi is a fantastic movie with many intriguing scenes and a strong plot. The acting was amazing\\, the directing was spot-on\\, and this movie produced some of the most memorable sequences I have had the pleasure of watching.  Fans that are interested in the lore of the force will be in awe at the ending and what it means for several characters\\, I know I was. Definitely a movie to see and watch again for fans and moviegoers alike.","true":true}
