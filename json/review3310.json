{"101487":108589,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before I explain what a terrible load of trash this movie is\\, I have to acknowledge that some parts were great. Sound effects\\, cinematography\\, visuals were mostly on point. There is one extremely cool scene in the movie\\, visually and conceptually\\, and one of the coolest moments in all of Star Wars history happened for about 6 minutes. \\n\\nHowever cool two or three scenes were\\, they are not worth wading through the lake of fetid shit that is this movie\\, to get to the small stepping stone of good content that made it in.\\n\\nYou'll see a lot of idiots talking about how \\\"Fans cry when the movie is the same\\, fans cry when the movie is different.\\\"\\n\\nThis movie isn't different. It's more\\, more\\, more of the same. The plot is directly copy pasted from ESB and ROTJ. They simply took those two movies\\, as if they had the scenes broken into individual video files\\, cherry picked scenes\\, and dropped them into a storyboard. Then re-recorded them with  new actors\\, sets\\, and slightly different context. The last scene in this movie is 98% copy pasted directly from the Rebels episode \\\"Kindred.\\\"\\n\\nThey did absolutely nothing new with this movie. No new plots that didn't end up pointless. No new vehicles or planets of any interest. Just slightly reminiscent versions of things that have come before like Super Star Destroyers etc. It's actually amazing that some OG Star Wars ships like a Mon Calamari Cruiser or Nebulon B frigate made it into the movie. \\n\\nThe worst part is\\, what little potential direction you could accuse The Force Awakens of having pushed the series in\\, was totally abandoned by Rian Johnson. All the plot threads started in Episode VII are abruptly and callously cut off or ended with no exposition\\, no climax\\, nothing. Don't get me wrong Episode VII was also terrible\\, but the least they could have done was follow the traditional mystery box method of JJ storytelling and actually developed upon what happened in the first movie of the trilogy.\\n\\nIt simply didn't happen. Instead of development we get more empty one dimensional characters who are immediately abandoned. I'm talking Walking Dead Season 4 level - except even the new characters introduced at the beginning (who immediately all died) still had more development and story.  \\n\\nMore needless visual splendor. More shallow world building without even building the world. More hackneyed modern vernacular with characters cursing and invoking God and acting like their situation is more dire than the original Rebellion\\, despite the First Order not having anywhere near the Empire's power. If that wasn't bad enough\\, the amount of needless\\, poorly written comic relief in this movie trumps Episode 1 - 3 combined. The movie literally starts with a 2 minute comic relief scene that was completely out of place\\, and it gets worse and worse from there. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi fails to capitalize on anything established in Force Awakens. It fails to explain a single one of Episode VIIs many questions\\, but at the same time\\, fails to introduce any questions or anything to move the plot forward after abruptly failing to deliver on TFA\\, either.  Sure\\, this movie is watchable\\, but it is utterly without substance. It fails on every possible level to do anything new with the franchise and as a middle episode to the trilogy accomplishes nothing.","true":true}
