Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A big thank you to Rian Johnson and his team for making probably the BEST Star wars film after episodes 5 & 4!!I thoroughly enjoyed it- whether it was the action scenes\\, the cool Galactic battles\\, amazing visuals\\, great acting (especially by Mark Hamill)\\, the background score by the great John Williams\\, cool plot twists and shocks (you couldn't predict like half of them)\\, the emotional appeal  and a compelling story! This film not only washes away the bad remnants of the prequels but pays ode to the original trilogy. It's probably the most original SW film I could ever ask for. Can't wait for Episode 9!","true":true}
