Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually amazing movie\\, but an insult to Star Wars lore. Lack of character development\\, plot-hole galore\\, forced political views replacing actual story\\, and mishandling of classic AND new characters plague R. Johnson's movie. Direction is very good (even excellent\\, sometimes) but not suited for a Star Wars movie. This movie will probably mark the downfall of a beloved 40 year old franchise","true":true}
