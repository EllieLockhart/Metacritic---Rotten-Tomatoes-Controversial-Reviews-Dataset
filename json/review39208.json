Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film completes Luke's journey over 30 years in the making and gives him one of the most interesting character arcs in movie history. We've seen him journey for innocent farm boy to cocky apprentice to Jedi warrior to bitter old man who decides he can still make a difference. One of the best films in the series next to The Empire Strikes Bakc and A New Hope.","true":true}
