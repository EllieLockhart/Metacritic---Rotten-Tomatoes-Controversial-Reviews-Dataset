Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't waste your money. This movie is about one hour too long. Disney has ruined the franchise with this one. Such a blatant display of a money grab. The movie is poorly written and the dialogue is horrendous. Please wait for it to come out on HBO or Starz.","true":true}
