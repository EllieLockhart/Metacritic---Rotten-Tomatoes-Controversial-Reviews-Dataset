Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im a long time star wars fan and was so excited to see the movie\\, it had some amazing scenes but overall not what I was expecting\\, unhappy with how Luke was portrayed as a pathetic excuse for a Jedi Master\\, characters did not have the depth as other star wars films\\, hoping that the next film will make up for this disappointment.
