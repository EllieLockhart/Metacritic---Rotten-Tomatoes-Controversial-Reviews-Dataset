Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had several weak plot points. What really stuck out about the movie was how several parts of the movie did not add at all to the story line and should have been removed from the film. However\\, if these parts were removed then the film would have probably only been ten minutes long. The story line was also weak overall as it seemed to focus on a single battle. It's truly amazing that with all the money that went into making this movie that the story line could not have been better. I hope Disney invests in better writers in the future. In all honesty\\, the best thing about seeing this movie in the theater was the movie theater popcorn.","true":true}
