Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How old is Rian Johnson? 8? Maybe 10?\\nHow old are the components  of the entirely female Lucasfilm story group who is responsible for this abomination of a movie?\\n\\nStupid\\, childish\\, naive\\, plainly dumb. These are the words that come in mind thinking about their creative productions:\\n\\n- Bombers with hand-held remote controls for opening the bomb doors\\, just to create a bit more mess in case you fumbled them\\, which of course happens in the movie. Doh! Well\\, anyway bombs cannot be dropped in absence of gravity\\, so...\\n\\n- Rose\\, a janitor girl with no training in anything\\, but she pilots a spaceship like a boss\\, rides an alien-horse like a pro\\, pilots a skiff so well on Crait that she is able to reach Finn and knock him out. Why? Because she is a woman. OK. And then she sexually assaults Finn after stopping his heroic effort to save the Resistance. Very romantic indeed. I cried. I really did. I felt violated.\\n\\n- Rey\\, a scavenger who lived her whole life on a shitty sandy planet\\, but she is able to pilot every type of spaceships (ah\\, by the way\\, spaceships are alway left parked everywhere with doors open and key inserted into ignition blocks\\, just in case someone needs to steal them)\\, plays sword better than Errol Flynn without any training\\, uses the force better than every Jedi master ever existed and\\, most surprisingly\\, she can swim (maybe on the sandy planet they had swimming pools and instructors)... Oh no. How stupid am I. She is a woman! That explains everything! Put facepalm emoticon here.\\n\\n- A Resistance Ring which\\, with a simple sweep\\, shows the emblem of the Resistance. Obviously\\, if you get captured\\, it will immediately reveal your allegiance to the Resistance to the enemy and may cost you your precious life but\\, hey\\, isn't that cute? Yay! And it enables you to use the force so that you can force-grab your broom and greet the Resistance who didn't free you from slavery. Workers of the world\\, unite! \\n\\nI may continue for pages and pages...\\n\\nIt really seems that the script has been written by a child or by a wishful thinking teenage girl. And no one stood up to say \\\"what's that shit?\\\"","true":true}
