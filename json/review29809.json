{"101487":165542,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right. This is the first time i feet compelled to actually write a review. I do admit I am a Star Wars fan. I watched the originals several times\\, I played most games\\, I watched Rebels and some Clone Wars\\, and I watched every Star Wars movie since Phantom Menace in cinema. And I did like EVERY single one of them! Sure\\, JarJar sucked\\, TFA was pretty much a copy of a NH but who cares and Rogue felt pretty generic. But it is Star Wars and the makers made the effort to create a compelling and somehow consistent story. \\n\\nSadly\\, this cant be said for the Last Jedi. Basically\\, the movie feels like Johnson looked at what is hyped most by the fanbase and then decided to screw them all over. Even if I try and look at the movie as not a Star Wars movie but say a standalone scifi action flick. It still is a bad movie. Sure\\, the visuals are stunning and the music is nice. But\\, apart from that\\, there are plotholes everywhere\\, the dialog is forced\\, the jokes are cheesy\\, there is no real reason for half of the actions of the cast and it just doesn't make much sense. \\n\\nFor example:\\n- How come that an experienced general\\, who is hunted by an overwhelming military force and seeks refuge in a fortress with a huge metal door forgets to close that said metal door? Does she need visual confirmation that the bad guys are really following? Good thing that this didn't cost any lifes after she told poe off earlier... Well\\, somehow they needed to get Fin back in I guess and it gave 30s more action. Well done!\\n- So\\, you can use a ship with hyperdrive as a sort of deus ex machina suicide torpedo to destroy capital ships? Good to know\\, I am wondering why the still use freaking lasers if you could just take a small vessel with hyperdrive\\, get a droid in there and hyperram the shit out of a star destroyer\\n- How exactly is snoke cut cleanly apart\\, if the lightsaber pretty much stabs him in the middle of the gut? Did I miss some magical lightsaber rotation trick? As far as I could tell the saber flew in a rather non rotating fashion\\n- Whats the deal with viceadmiral purple hair? Everybody knows they are in a tight spot and she has a plan but she won't tell anybody and so everbody has to think they are all gonna die. What could possibly go wrong? Apart from that\\, not a cool move purple hair!\\n- And there is the Finn suicide run where he got \\\"saved\\\" by girl which sadly was not interesting enough for her name to register. How did that work exactly? \\n- What the hell was the point of the casino 45min story? Yeah\\, animal cruelty is bad (so is child slavery btw)\\, rich people are mean\\, people get richer by war profiteering. I guess we all know that\\, it didn't need this huge junk of screentime. Especially as the plot related effects where exactly zero. Pointless waste of time. Also\\, Benicio delTorro?\\n\\nThose are just the top of my head things I remember as annoying moments of crappy movie making. \\n\\n Most of the Star Wars related criticism has been voiced and I wont repeat them in detail.\\n- I am massively dissapointed by the portrayal of Luke. It all just seems out of character. \\n- The Leia Mary Poppins scene was just weird\\n- Rey picking up skills insanely fast. Seriously\\, what is the deal here? There is a difference between raw potential and mastery of skills. Freaking Anakin was the most gifted (before Rey I guess) and it took him just years and years to become a powerful force user and lightsaber combatant... \\n- Forceghost can shot lightning? I can think of a moment or two where this would have been handy. I am looking at you Ben Kenobi.\\n    \\nThe list goes on...\\n\\nHowever\\, after the general movie problems and the Star Wars related screw ups\\, I'm not done. Because there is one thing that pissed me off even more. Namely\\, the feeling of being screwed over for no apparent reason. After watching TFA we were was faced two big questions  \\n\\n1) Who is Snoke?\\n2) Who are Rey's parents?\\n\\nThose questions are not some random inconsequential crap only diehard fanboys get exited about. Even my Star Wars novice girlfriend was intrigued. And I am pretty sure this was exactly what the movie intended. However\\, instead of answerig those questions\\, Snoke is dead and Rey's parents are nobodies. Great! So what was the point in teasing again?. Basically\\, Johnson took a massive dump on everybody who got invested into the characters and the story of TFA and Star Wars in general.\\n\\nConclusion: It pains my heart\\, but this was the last Star Wars I watch in cinema simply because it has Star Wars in the name. The franchise has degraded to the point where I have to treat it like every other movie\\, i.e. go to the cinema if I hear good things about it and ignore if not.\\n\\nI tried to keep a measured tone and not get all angry fan and all. But to finish the critique I have one more thing to say: \\n\\nScrew Disney and screw you Mr. Johnson! You raped Star Wars","true":true}
