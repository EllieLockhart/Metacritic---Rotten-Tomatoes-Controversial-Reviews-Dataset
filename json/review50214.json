Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a dumbster fire that if your a fan of the original trilogy will kill whats left of your fandom for the series.... worse then the prequals to do that to luke and the mythos that made the franchise so great","true":true}
