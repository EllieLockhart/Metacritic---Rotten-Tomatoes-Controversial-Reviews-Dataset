Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOOOOOOVED it!!   I loved the Kylo and Rey scenes so much!! Don't believe the bullshit 52% score from the audience.  Every single person I have talked to who has seen it\\, LOOOOOVED it!!  Screw those baby fan boys who hate to see women in command rolls and minorities as lead characters.","true":true}
