Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an awful sequel.\\n\\nEverything that was interesting about the \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was brushed aside in this film for the purpose of \\\"subverting expectations\\\".\\n\\nEvery flaw of \\\"the Force Awakens\\\" was amplified 10-fold in this film.\\n\\nFor all of its flaws\\, I could have forgiven them if the movie told an interesting story\\, but it fails to accomplish that too. The movie basically ends where it began: with the Resistance\/Rebels on the run.","true":true}
