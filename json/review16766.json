Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion this is the second best star wars film. I was ultimately disappointed by the for awakens as it was a new hope in shiny new packaging\\, so when Ryan Johnson said he wanted do somthing new I was excited. This film is remarkable for a star wars film as it is character druven. The action and plot are all a natural extensions of how the characters would think and behave. Everyone in it has a real arc\\, including the antagonists. Because of this I could imagine that some find the plot unfocused but that\\, to me is missing the point. The film is focused\\, on it's characters. Now for the die hard fans there are some changes to characters which may jar you and which may put you off\\, Don't go in expecting old star wars\\, go on expecting somthing new.","true":true}
