You get to see Joel and Ellie strengthening their bond while crossing the whole country through many cities\\, towns\\, fighting against many different enemies in different environments throughout four seasons in a year. We get to see a bad-ass Joel\\, who is a perfect Father Figure and Ellie - a playful but fearsome 14-yo girl\\, and seeing them together talking and helping each other out is something I\u2019ve never seen in any forms of entertainment. The ending was so good that I never thought there would be a sequel. BUT LET\u2019S GET REAL HERE... the sequel is just a mess.\rIn TLOU part 2. It can be seen that the basics stayed almost the same. The graphic is enormously improved and the environment is much more richer and more realistic. Gameplay is improved and songs are excellent - they made mighty impacts on players\u2019 feelings and emotions. But what disappointing was the storytelling. Everything should be connected together from the previous part in a logical and sensible way\\, but they just use the fact that Joel killed a significantly unimportant surgeon to try to save Ellie\\, just to make TLOU 2 happened seems really fanfic. Character development is poor and insignificant\\, like besides from Ellie and Joel\\, I hardly get a feeling for any characters else. Playing as Ellie doesn\u2019t have the same vibe as the first part when she pretty much just mumbles around being sad because Naughty Dogs\u2019 stupid storytelling (Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, she\u2019s still awesome and all). Environmental puzzles just disappears\\, and instead you just follow the route and that\u2019s it. This is spoil-free but half of the game you just play as someone who\u2019s NOT Ellie and it\u2019s pointless. Even up until the end\\, all I did was watching Joel and Ellie cut-scenes.\rMy expectation was to see Joel and Ellie rolling again together\\, but instead ND just punches us hard in the face from the beginning and tries to relief us in the second useless half of the game. When you get to the point when you play as an another character\\, you\u2019ll be missing playing Ellie so hard.\rI love TLOU\\, I love seeing Joel and Ellie together. I mean this review is a mess already\\, just like TLOU 2.\rIF YOU\u2019RE UP TO THE GAMEPLAY\\, GO AHEAD AND PLAY. But if you really care about the relationship between Joel and Ellie\\, or what was good about the first TLOU\\, keep yourself away from the game\\, you can listen to Ellie and Joel singing\\, but don\u2019t play the game.\rUPDATE: JUST FINISHED THE GAME\\, AND IT\u2019S A MESS.
