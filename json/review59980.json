We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have thought a long time before writing. It is a very hard time for The Last of Us lovers. I consider it a really badly-made game and I'm going to try to show it to you in here\\, without any spoilers.\r\r- Story: the story goes around in circles and not in a way that makes you exclaim \\\"Wow! So bright!\\\" but in a very dull way\\, which makes the player suffer. Some did like that\\, but I sureI have thought a long time before writing. It is a very hard time for The Last of Us lovers. I consider it a really badly-made game and I'm going to try to show it to you in here\\, without any spoilers.\r\r- Story: the story goes around in circles and not in a way that makes you exclaim \\\"Wow! So bright!\\\" but in a very dull way\\, which makes the player suffer. Some did like that\\, but I sure didn't\\, I like my games clear and not foggy about their intentions and also my characters. Indecisiveness of characters in this game is really weird and forced\\, I really don't know how they could make such a rookie mistake. The story is one of the most important elements for this game so this is what makes everything drop to such a low score.\r\r- Characters: 4 years are a long time\\, but Ellie is somewhat unrecognizable in her main features. One could say she's been disfigured by the thirst for revenge\\, but sincerely\\, I don't buy that. Mainly poor writing on that side and an especially vicious one. Let me tell you why: they want to make you question her every move and somehow hate her for the rampage she goes into. Still\\, maybe it could be done\\, but not this way. They're just trying to stuff our throats with pre-fabricated things\\, without justifying them a bit more.\r\r- Gameplay: fun. But it's too long. Really\\, I never thought I'd say this\\, but it drags so much and without piling up the drama with story (which\\, as I said\\, is pretty dull) that I found myself hoping it ended several times before the end. It is really sad to say this. Really\\, really sad.\r\r- Level building: all the 10s around say it's genius\\, but sorry\\, no\\, it's not. I admit I liked the Seattle part\\, a weirdly structured open world HUB at the start of the game. But um... why was this the only one? Druckmann said it had to be open world\\, and well I actually see that. Just looks like a weird hybrid\\, but you're on rails most of the time. Why is this being called genius? I really can't understand. I like the new additions of tall grass and small openings and the fluidity of all the action and moving around\\, that's sexy. Still\\, not even close to genius level building\\, p-lease.\r\rIn conclusion: the game could have been great. If not a 10 (like The Last of Us could look now\\, compared to this) at least a good solid 9. That's probably what all of us gamers asked for\\, but got this indecisive\\, weird story where they forced us to empathise with the new character and try to make us hate the shell of an old beloved character. The idea ain't bad\\, but it's INSINCERE execution lacks honesty\\, truthfulness and mere story-telling ability.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
