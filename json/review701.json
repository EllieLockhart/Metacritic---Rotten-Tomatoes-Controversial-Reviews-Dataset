Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing( though slightly depressing) film. Beautifully shot and extremely well acted. Mark Hamill really impressed me in this film. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver also did some excellent work. Love the way it  deconstructs and subverts popular tropes in these types of movies. For example  the hot shot pilot with a risky \\\"1 in a million\\\" plan? Fails...repeatedly. Also seeing the resistance actually being squashed  was a bit hard to take but the last few scene do give a beautiful sense of hope i really appreciated. I know audiences are having a difficult time with it now but I have no doubt it will be vindicated by history and placed up near ESB  as one of the best SW films.","true":true}
