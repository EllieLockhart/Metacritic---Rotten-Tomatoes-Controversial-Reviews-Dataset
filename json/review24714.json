Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was so long\\, thought the movie was going to be over before something finally happens. In other words it drags\\, but it\u2019s funny and has classic quotes. Overall good movie.","true":true}
