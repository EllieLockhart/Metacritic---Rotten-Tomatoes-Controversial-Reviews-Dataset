Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since birth\\, and this was everything the franchise needed. Large operatic moments. Complex characters. New facets. If you go to the movies to tear them apart\\, you can find plenty that is new\\, and people hate new. But \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" makes sure no one could come out of it saying Star Wars was getting stale and predictable.","true":true}
