Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a humongous turd. I want my money back.\\nThe professional critics should be ashamed. \\n91%? They all must have been watching a different movie than we have.\\nMaybe Disney produced a special edition just for them\\, without all the plot holes\\, paper-thin characters\\, deus ex machina everywhere\\, stupid plot twists created only to subvert expectations\\, incoherent dialogs\\, utter disrespect for the SW lore.\\nA 91% tomatometer for this steaming pile of Johnson's shit can only be explained this way.\\nOr\\, maybe they have been paid to lie.\\nFor sure I will not trust them when the next SW movies will come out of Disney's butt hole.","true":true}
