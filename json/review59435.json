I enjoyed the setting\\, the characters\\, and the story. It only really started to lose me in the last couple of hours because the battle arenas and story felt a little unpolished and rushed. But the first half of the game? To be honest\\, I was kind of enjoying it more than the first one\\, and I know that's controversial to say. I don't feel like I played the same game that everyone else seems to be complaining about. It has some of the most natural LGBT representation I've seen in a video game\\, which is refreshing. Some people think that the theme of revenge is a little too intense\\, and I can understand that. It's a very emotionally draining game\\, and if not in the right mindset\\, you might not be prepared to play it and have FUN with it. But I did. The first 20-24 hours of the game were meant for me. I enjoyed almost everything it had to offer and I'm currently working on my second playthrough. Please play the game yourself\\, or watch a playthrough from someone who hasn't already made up their mind before playing it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
