Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie sucks !!!! Is it actually a Star War movie??? A whole lot of things are deemed UNIMPORTANT by the Director\\, even the Force itself is not IMPORTANT enough??? Cannot believe... So Wonder Woman Rey is just...wonder and powerful by herself???\\n\\nAnd yeah\\, Supreme Leader Snoke?? the damn leader is truly damn blind !!! Cannot understand why he had to close his damn eyes?? and his so-called elite guards are blind also not to notice Ren's plan....\\n\\nSpeechless...so many bullshits","true":true}
