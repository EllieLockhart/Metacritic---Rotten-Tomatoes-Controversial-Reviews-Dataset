Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie by itself is mediocre at best\\, my friends and I can hardly keep awake in theatre. Yet the thing pissed off fans the most is not that its a bad movie\\, but how little respect it shows to the Star Wars media that comes before it. From what I have seen\\, any fan that has indulged in some real good star wars media (e.g. TCW\\, KOTOR) generally dislike this film intensely.","true":true}
