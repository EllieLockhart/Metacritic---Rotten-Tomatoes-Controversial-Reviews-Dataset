Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's terrible\\, The worst Star wars movie ever made. It could be a sequel to Spaceballs... but that movie was much better. Disney dropped the ball with Rian Johnson and Lucas film with Kathleen Kennedy.. Please just stop ruining our childhood and beloved characters.","true":true}
