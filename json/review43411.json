Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an okay kids movie that lacked any depth and failed to address the mysteries of episode VII.  Not to mention the path they went with Luke Skywalker was in my life long Star Wars fan opinion extremely poor.  I am very disappointed in Disney.  After Episode Vii I had higher hopes for this movie.","true":true}
