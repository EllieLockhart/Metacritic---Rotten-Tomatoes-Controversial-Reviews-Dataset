Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have so much love for the franchise and the universe of STAR WARS\\, feels shitty to leave the movie theater thinking wtf was the director thinking. I would imagine someone directing STAR WARS would know that throwing build up in the garbage just doesn't work. Don't even get me started with the story telling issues\\, and how this movie goes against so much of what's already established in the previous movies. The character assassination of Luke Skywalker hurts the most.","true":true}
