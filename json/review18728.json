Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a fantastic movie\\, aiming the franchise toward the future.  We fans can't keep saying that we don't want the movies to be rehashes of the original trilogy and then blast Disney\\, Lucasfilm and Rian Johnson for creating an entirely new experience.  I loved every minute of it and can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
