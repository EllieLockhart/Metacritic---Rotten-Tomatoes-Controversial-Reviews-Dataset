People wanted Ellie & Joel part 2 and they were given something very different. If you sit deep in your expectations and refuse to go with the story then you will ultimately have a disappointing experience\\, but if you are open to being led wherever the story needs to go then this game is the most compelling and satisfying experience that you can have with a videogame. This game is better than the first in almost every way. Graphics\\, music\\, storytelling\\, acting are all superb. But the true brilliance is the way in which Naughty Dog challenge the good guy\/bad guy convention of videogames. In TLOU2\\, just as in real life\\, there are no good and no bad guys\\, there are simply people doing what they need to do to make it through. The switch from Ellie to Abby means that we are invested in both characters and the final fight - being asked to pummel a character you deeply care about - is emotionally tough. I have never been asked to do something in a videogame that I have not wanted to do. It was an incredible experience and well earned.\r\rI wonder whether it is this close-to-life experience that people did not like. Gamers are used to breaking from reality and escaping into very black and white worlds and perhaps it is what they need to make it through the sometimes bleakness of the real world. But I appreciate this game all the more for taking a risk and challenge convention. I applaud Naughty Dog for the direction in which they have taken the game. It would have been very easy to simply do Joel and Ellie again with better weapons and new enemies - the common fare for most video game sequels. They haven't. They have created something far more interesting and complex. The characters have evolved and grown and we are asked\\, just as we were with the first game\\, to think and question.\r\rI can only hope that a third is on the way. And to those who feel let down\\, I wonder whether with time and distance and expectation abated\\, you may revisit this and find the game to be the truly remarkable masterpiece that I do.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
