Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heartbreakingly bad. Rule 1\\, if its a well known and loved character  destroy their legacy\\, kill them\\, do both or ignore them. Rule 2\\, if its a new and potentially interesting character don't develop them\\, kill them\\, do both or regress them. \\nScript abysmal. Main plot extremely boring and full of holes. Sub plots absolutely pointless\\, tedious\\, preachy and full of holes. Acting\\, fair to excruciating. Excitement zero\\, anticipation for next episode zero\\, interest in what that kid will do with his broom non-existent. \\nThere's a Meerkat insurance advert that is more entertaining than the film it's referencing.\\nJust thankful i'm of the generation that got to see and appreciate the original Star Wars trilogy in all its glory.","true":true}
