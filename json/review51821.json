Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic addition to the Star Wars franchise that continues to bring maturity to the franchise. It is not without its flaws but it is fundamentally a very accomplished film that is underpinned by emotional maturity and humanity.","true":true}
