Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, I cannot believe how this many audience people are so up in arms about this Amazing and Fantastic Movie!! Pure cinematic Joy. I have to discount some of them as they are super fans of the prequels which automatically eliminates their validity in their review. J.J. Abrams was criticized for his \\\"rehash\\\" of a New Hope (which by the way\\, I actually loved as well and did not find it bad in anyway) and now that Rian has taken many chances and risks he is being blasted for it is just stupid and hypocritical. Everyone needs to see it again and again to really appreciate this movie and see it for how much it expands the lore of Star Wars and the Force as well as allows for so many new stories and chances in the future. Rian is a visionary that deserves praise not knee-jerk whiny fits by those who don't like different\\, but actually the same\\, and new stories and character building and closing. Heck of a job directing and writing Rian\\, I applaud this movie and can't wait to see it many more times and buy it first hand when it comes out!","true":true}
