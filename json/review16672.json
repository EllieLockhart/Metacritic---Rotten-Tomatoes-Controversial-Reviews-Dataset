Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Indeed watching jedi is entertaining and chewbacca R2D2 &c 3PO  Making cameo appearances always brings back the  Nostalgia of the original 3 episodes.    However much like how episode 7 was just another remake of episode 4 episode 8 made a feeble attempt to model episode 5 the Empire strikes back.  ** slight spoiler alert\\, but not really.**  One glaring issue is suspending disbelief as the rebel forces enacted a play to best the Empire in a way that leaves you thinking why don't they do this every single time they are under attack as the solution was performed by an individual and completely comprehensive in destroying an entire fleet. This was barely entertaining for this avid star wars lover.","true":true}
