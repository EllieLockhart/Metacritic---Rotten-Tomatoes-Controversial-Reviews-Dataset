Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was convoluted. The movie played itself out like a poorly scripted 30min episode from the animated clone wars series. Except that it was stretched out for 2hrs 32mins. None of the progression of the events really effected any of the character development. The best scene in the movie between Luke and a force ghost again didn\u2019t impact anything of significantly. The manor at which the rebels were tracked made no sense considering the centuries of space travel and technology within the Star Wars universe. And for god sakes who wants to see a prolonged stage of star destroyers slowly following rebel ships as they run out of gas then get picked off. ","true":true}
