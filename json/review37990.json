Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The special effects are good. That's it.\\nMaybe if you've never seen another star wars film you'll enjoy this\\, as you wont have to suffer the ridiculous backpedaling\\, and changes to core features of Jedi and historically great characters. Honestly it could be forgiven\\, if it were not for the fact that most of the new characters are flawed\\, and not flawed as in have vices and weaknesses\\, flawed in that they are a complex mix of Mary sue's and god awful military tacticians.","true":true}
