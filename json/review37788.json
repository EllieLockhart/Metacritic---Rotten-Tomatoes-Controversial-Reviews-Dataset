Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were flaws in this movie\\, namely a little too much slapstick humor that took you out of the universe. But it's a beautiful looking movie\\, adds some complexity to the Force and holds Mark Hamill's best Luke performance of all 4 (5 technically) movies.","true":true}
