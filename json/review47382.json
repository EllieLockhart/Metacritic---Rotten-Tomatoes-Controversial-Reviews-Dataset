Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can really be said of The Last Jedi? A lot of stuff happens\\, some more expectedly than others. It is funny at times but also extremely dark. But most of all it suffers many of the same mistakes made in The Force Awakens\\, including bad character development\\, throw-away lines that prove to be quite important\\, and the overuse of misdirection and blurred motivations. It is a fun film that I will see again and recommend to anybody who loves Star Wars\\, but it is no Empire Strikes Back nor even really a coherent film. I sincerely hope Disney gets their act together to tie up every loose end they've created in this lazily-edited trilogy.","true":true}
