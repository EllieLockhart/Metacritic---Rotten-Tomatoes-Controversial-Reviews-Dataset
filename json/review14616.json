Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a SW fan since 1978. This film is the worse of all. The battles were terrible\\, the characters were bad. After the film I had to explain to my kids that 30 years ago they knew how to do better movies and now I am just feeling I will not take them to watch the next one.","true":true}
