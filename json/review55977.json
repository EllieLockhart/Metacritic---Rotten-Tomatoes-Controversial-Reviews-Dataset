Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined star wars. This started out amazing with brilliant imagery\\, like that bomber scene\\, but was quickly ruined. They manage to throw away everything they set up in the first movie\\, and it has the feeling they just got bored and changed their minds. So unsatisfying to the fans and that scene with Leia.
