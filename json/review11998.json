Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. I think it's my favorite one out of the whole shebang. I say that with a bit of reservation because I've only seen it once but for now I think it is.\\nI went in with no expectations and no biases\\, I just let them tell their story. What I saw was a wonderful and sometimes profound film about sacrifice. From the opening scene to the last\\, it perfectly hit every note of what sacrifice means.\\nAnd it was damn pretty to look at.\\n\\nI'm hearing that some people are really angry about it\\, and these are real fans. That must really suck for them\\, to be waiting for this movie all of this time and then they hate it.\\nI don't understand the anger\\, but I'm not as attached to it as they might be. I love Star Wars but not enough to hate it.\\n- Justin 'MythTickle'","true":true}
