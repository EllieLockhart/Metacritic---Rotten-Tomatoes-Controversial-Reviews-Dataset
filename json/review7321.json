Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 added nothing to the star wars franchise. No character development or broadening the story. The story almost made it interesting but then immediately went back to the usual boring 2 sided fights. Same problem episode 7 had. No risks taken and just comical release before there is even a little tension. I wish they dared to divert more for the originals.","true":true}
