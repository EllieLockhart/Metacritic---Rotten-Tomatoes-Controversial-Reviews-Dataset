Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I completely understand why half of the fans will love this movie\\, and half will hate it. It's a divisive film for Star Wars. It isn't easy\\, it isn't comfortable. But it's what Star Wars needs if it is to continue. It needs to change. And I love the changes going forward.","true":true}
