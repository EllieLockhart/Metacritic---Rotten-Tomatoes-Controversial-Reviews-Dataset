Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the visuals! Everyone I know loved the visuals! Those bird things were adorable! I also loved...\\nNo\\, I take that back. That's all. Apart from those things\\, I really hated everything else about it. The story has more plot holes than a flour sift. The characters are outright revolting. The effort being made to merchandise this filth is ridiculous! Fin is a coward\\, Rey is pathetic\\, and frankly those  are the only descriptors I can give to almost any character I see in the story. Before the end\\, I wanted to shoot that weenie Luke myself\\, and watch that hacker fly away with the Falcon! It would have been better ending than the stupid slackers we saw flying away with it.\\n\\nNo\\, this stands as proof. Proof that the Authors and Directors of this film have no concept of integrity\\, virtue\\, or ethics. A monument of delusional ignorance in our generation. Proof also that Disney has indeed become the \\\"Microsoft\\\" of the entertainment industry. An immense\\, vile organization bent on making money and pushing their views on the world by assimilating anything money can buy.","true":true}
