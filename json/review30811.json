Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SNOKE HAD NO POINT AFTER HE WAS KILLED BY KYLO REN WHICH SUCKED BEING SOMEONE WHO WAS SO POWERFUL AND THEY KILLED LUKE SKYWALKER AND A VERY WACK WAY AND DOES ANYONE ELSE FILL LIKE IT SHOULD HAD BEEN GENERAL ACKABAR (IT'S A TRAP GUY) SHOULD HAD REPLACED HALDO WHEN SHE FLEW THE SHIP INTO THE OTHER SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED SAYING (YOUR TRAPPED RIGHT BEFORE IT CRASHED) OTHERWISE EVERYTHING WAS GOOD IT GET'S A C+ FROM ME!","true":true}
