Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was terrible. Even if we ignore the SJW propaganda that infests every minute of the film\\, the characters were awful and the plot was filled with holes. Nothing about this film even felt like Star Wars (aliens in tuxedos gambling at a galactic Foxwood's??)\\nEven Jar Jar would be ashamed to associate with such a hot piece of trash that is The Last Jedi.","true":true}
