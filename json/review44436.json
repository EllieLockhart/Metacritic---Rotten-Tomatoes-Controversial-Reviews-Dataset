Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much humor.  Too many plot holes.  Many things that were set up from episode 7 were basically thrown off a cliff (Snoke\\, Knights of Ren\\, Rey's parents\\, etc.).  Good movie for an average movie goer\\, bad movie for a Star Wars fan.  Better than the three prequels but not better than any of the others.","true":true}
