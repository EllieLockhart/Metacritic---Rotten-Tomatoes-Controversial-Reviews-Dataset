Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is hands down the best of the Disney era Star Wars so far\\, from its well conceived themes\\, it's subverting of your expectations to its fast\\, nostalgia filled action.\\n\\nAnyone who can honestly give this movie below 3 stars has no understanding of what makes a great film. And to give it a half star is just plain idiotic\\, this site is full of imbeciles who think it's edgy to give it the lowest review score because the property is owned buy a large corporation\\, pull your head out.","true":true}
