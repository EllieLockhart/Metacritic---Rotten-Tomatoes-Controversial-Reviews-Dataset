Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this movie a second time\\, I came the the conclusion that it is actually a very good movie. Now there are a few areas where it faulters (namely the horrible casting of Rose and Vice Admiral Holdo). As someone who read every book I have to say I think they handled the Luke story arc well. If you really think about it\\, he had maybe 1 week of training and yet he is supposed to be unshakable in the ways of the Jedi? The end scenes with him where the best parts of the movie and a fitting end. Also please stop making comments about Leia\\, they could not rewrite and reshoot a vast majority of the movie after she passed. Looking forward to see how they close this off in 18 months.","true":true}
