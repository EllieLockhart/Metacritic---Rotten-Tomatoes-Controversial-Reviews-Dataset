Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forget what anyone else had told you Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the amazing star wars we needed. From the use of the force\\, to the relationship between Kylo and Rey\\, to the chemistry that Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley share\\, it pulls out all the stops. This is the movie of the year and shows the best side of Lucas Films since three original trilogy. All those that are complaining had decided before they went in what they wanted to happen\\, Rian Johnson was able to open the universe to all possibilities and not tee cookie cutter story that the EU showed us. Rey is the hero of our generation. Having spent the last 32 years of my life as a Star Wars fan\\, I can honestly say I love The Last Jedi.","true":true}
