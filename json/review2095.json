Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"as this franchise matures\\, attention to detail has been falling away. The storyline is so complicated now that it would take a scientist to follow it. Having seen every one of the Star Wars movies to date\\, this is by no means the best one. It's good no better than average. ","true":true}
