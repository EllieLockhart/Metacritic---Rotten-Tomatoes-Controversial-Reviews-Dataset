Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it lacks the gravitas of the Original Trilogy\\, (and even some of the more worthwhile elements of the Prequels which made them so endearing to a cult selection of fans)\\, The Last Jedi is an interesting yet different edition to the Star Wars saga. While some elements of humour are out-of-place\\, and some characters (namely Rose and Poe) could have been made a tad more likeable with a few revisions to the dialogue here or there\\, the adventures into unknown regions of character\\, world\\, and lore make this film a great addition to the saga\\, even if the runtime is a little liberal.","true":true}
