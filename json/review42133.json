Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined my childhood. I wish the empire destroyed the universe in episode 6. Every star wars fans will cringe seeing this movies. If you want to satisfy your star wars addiction go watch Rebels.","true":true}
