Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long time star wars fan and I took my young daughter along to watch this movie and we both absolutely loved it. \\n\\nI found it refreshing to have some of the old tropes shaken up a little and for me it breathed new life into the franchise. The actors delivered cracking performances\\, but I particularly enjoyed Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker - I can clearly see how he ended up where he did and he was fantastic.\\n\\nCertainly not perfect but exciting and great fun to watch!","true":true}
