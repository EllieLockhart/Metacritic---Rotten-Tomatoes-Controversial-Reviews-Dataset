Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think Disney will have to remove Kathleen Feminazi Kennedy and that excuse of a director Rian Fuckface Johnson for the harm they intentionally did to a Disney property which costed them 4 billion dollars.\\nThey introduced a completely useless chinese character just to lure more chinese viewers to the theaters and they failed miserably. The movie was completely pulled from cinemas after very few days of screening\\, chinese most upvoded comment being \\\"the whole film really insults the IQ of its audience\\\".\\nDisney's media power in China did not prove as big as in America and Europe\\, where it threatened professional critics or plainly paid them to write positive reviews.\\nThe movie has been publicly criticized even by feminists for misrepresenting their true values of gender equality versus toxic and sexist female-supremacy and male-belittling.\\nDon't be fooled. Kennedy selected Rian Fuckface Johnson\\, a very poor writer and an even poorer director with no experience with big saga movies\\, just because he promised to do everything she asked him. \\nMoreover\\, the Pareto Law (20\/80 Rule) says that every single company in the world\\, including Disney\\, owes its success to the 20% loyal customer base which generates 80% of the company's revenue. If we focus on Disney's market regarding Star Wars\\, that 20% loyal customer base is mainly composed by middle-aged\\, wealthy\\, white men. Heterosexual middle-aged\\, wealthy white women are the only significant variation.\\nKathleen Kennedy intentionally (have no doubt after hearing her say \\\"The Force Is Female!\\\" - BTW how sexist is that statement???) slapped the loyal customer base of the Star Wars franchise right in the face with The Last Jedi\\, so Disney can expect 80% losses from the next installments of the franchise. I\\, for sure\\, will not give Disney any more money for anything regarding Star Wars.\\nI frankly doubt Disney will be happy with losing such a stratospheric amount of money\\, so I hope that someone at Disney will stop that evil feminazi from vandalizing something that could easily be called a treasure of American and western pop-culture.\\nBy now Disney is backing up the president of Lucasfilm by stating that she and Johnson have done a great job\\, but when the sky will start tumbling down\\, the two of them will be fired unceremoniously.\\nNot that this could make a difference anymore. \\nDisney's Star Wars is not Star Wars anymore.\\nStar Wars canon comprises 6 movies\\, episodes I to VI. Rogue One can easily be considered part of the canon too. The two abominations defecated by Disney break so many rules of the original Star Wars universe that they deliberately choose not to belong to the canon.\\nIn regard to Disney's Star Wars\\, therefore\\, we all should start renaming their movies like \\\"Star Wars DAU - The Force Awakens\\\" and \\\"Star Wars DAU - The Last Jedi\\\"\\, DAU being the acronym for Disney Alternate Universe.","true":true}
