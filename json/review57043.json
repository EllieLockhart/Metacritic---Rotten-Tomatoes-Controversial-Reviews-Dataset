Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an absolute disgrace. Aside from the plot holes and general quibbles one could have with any imperfect film\\, what makes this such a horrible work is that it is a betrayal and mockery of all that is great in Star Wars. The Jedi? Thrown to the curb. The Sith? Who cares. Compassionate\\, fearless hero Luke? Nope; just a grumpy old man too depressed to get off his ass. Good and Evil? Beyond good and evil. Mystery? Nope; nothing matters. History and tradition? Kill the past. A noble fight for what is right and good and true? Save the camel-horse-sheep-llamas. Fearless fighters willing to give their lives for the good of others? Silly hot-head \\\"flyboys\\\".\\n\\nI am sickened by this betrayal. I normally watch Star Wars movies\\, even the ones that are not my favorites\\, multiple times in the theater but I will not watch this one and I will most likely not watch Episode 9 unless the true fans hail it as the redeeming film we all hope it will be.\\n\\nI really liked Force Awakens and Rogue One. Those were Star Wars movies. This is a heap of garbage.","true":true}
