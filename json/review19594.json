Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took what was great about TFA\\, ruined all that\\, took what we wanted to see of Luke\\, and did our boy wrong. It was half boring half divert expectations for the worse. Second worse Star Wars film next to Attack of The Clones.","true":true}
