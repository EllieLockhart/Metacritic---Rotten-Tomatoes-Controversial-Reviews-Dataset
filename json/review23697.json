Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke dropped his lightsaber ???  the force and the jedi are a religion ??  the script is very bad.  It is not what we expected to see.  I didn't like the movie made by Rian Johnson","true":true}
