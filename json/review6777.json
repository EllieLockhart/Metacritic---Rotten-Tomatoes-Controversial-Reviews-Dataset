Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the RT score. Obviously weighted. For example Black-ish has a 100% and a 48% public opinion. There's no way they have no critic that didn't like it. It's laughable.\\n\\nAnyways this movie is pretty terrible. I'd give it a two but to make it climb down to the 25% it deserves\\, I'll rate it a 1\/5.\\n\\nIf anyone reads this\\, just know this movie makes zero sense. I've never had a movie that's nearly 3 hours give absolutely nothing in return. We know even less than we did. It's just horrible.\\n\\nIf you want to know my thoughts\\, please check out MauLer's videos on the movie. It's a perfect review of everything that makes this the absolute worst Star Wars film.","true":true}
