{"101487":175786,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a narrative mess. It lacked motivation for inconsistent characters. The \\\"twists\\\" failed to further the story\\, instead grinding it to a halt. I couldn't think of an audience that I could recommend this to\\, perhaps michael bay fanatics for the special effects? All of \\\"moral of the story\\\" moments Ryan Johnson puts in the movie are contradicted\\, rendering them meaningless. That's a pretty good summary of the film\\, meaningless\\, but I'd add pointless as well. Nothing is accomplished in the film other than killing off people. Ray doesn't gain power\\, nobody learns anything of importance\\, and any surviving characters found themselves in the same predicament they were at the start of the film. A very dull\\, Tom and Jerry like chase that seems to have stagnated for an entire movie.","true":true}
