Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has polarized viewers: Almost everyone either loves it or hates it. I loved it\\, so the vitriol for it I discovered on the internet shocked me into researching to find exactly why people hate it. There are two real reasons people hate it. They may make up additional reasons to dress up their gut reaction with words\\, but this is the truth. They hate it because \\nA) They had built up years of specific expectations\\, and were disappointed that the movie went a different way or \\nB) They are men (probably straight white men) who dislike that women and people of color are being treated like people by the narrative\\, rather than like chattel or cardboard stereotypes. \\n\\nReason A is understanable. I might have fallen into that trap if I tended to get attached to my fan theories. But hating the movie because it isn't a dramatization of your hopes doesn't allow the movie to stand on it's own. It isn't an assessment of the movie that can help others to predict whether *they* will enjoy it. \\n\\nReason B is\\, of course\\, hilarious\\, sad\\, and very\\, very easy to dismiss. Lol @ those guys. \\n\\nSo see the movie with an open mind rather than with to many specific predictions\/expectations\\, and you'll be more likely to enjoy the experience. Because it really is a good\\, if nontraditonal\\, Star Wars movie.","true":true}
