Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars franchise always welcomes new minds to guide the immortal Force and new wondrous souls to explore the galaxy far\\, far away. This is pretty clear since \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" started the Sequel Trilogy\\, followed by \\\"Rogue One\\\" to even make the lore much fresher from the new aestheticizing approach to the traditions. Now next up in the present timeline after the Original Trilogy\\, replicating the middle chapter placement anticipation-wise\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" tends to remind us how far\\, and twisted\\, a middle chapter would go for in the narration as a whole.\\n\\nWith the Resistance crippled after the devastating destruction of the Republic\\, they're struggling at the end of what they stand for as the First Order gains the upper hand with Supreme Leader Snoke finding an easy flex for his grip on the galaxy. While the Resistance struggles\\, hope still stands in a meanwhile when Rey has found the self-exiled Luke Skywalker\\, hoping that he can bring a stop to the First Order's thorough reign of terror. But the focus gets shifted when Rey finds herself under the legendary Jedi Master's reluctance guidance.\\n\\nThe latest chapter in the saga heightens its predecessor through all aspects by an unconventional approach through a gracefully written direction\\, albeit admittedly less fresh but shines more as the storytelling progresses. It touch bases to what makes the franchise great from the anticipation matching the excitement that was assumingly felt towards \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" to director Rian Johnson mending the lore in his own embrace that expresses a typical fan's relationship\\, which was subtextually celebrated - along with hidden political jabs. With Johnson helming the journey with resulted overall perfection\\, he'd added complexity and ambiguity into the said approach under a certain merit towards mainly the characterization for emotional depth and brief poeticism\\, including the newer blood while the original blood was given an extension to their arcs. He has also added acceptable amount of humor for a lighter purpose into the claimed darker storyline\\, but the humorous level is reassuringly below average than the contemporary superhero films.\\n\\nResponding to what's been interpreted on the script\\, the cast\\, both old and new\\, performed with excellence and aged wisdom. One of the best aspects that powered Episode VII's nostalgic ride was the prime returns of the original heroes\\, weighing the chemistry and pushed diversity with the cast's fresh blood. Mark Hamill made a triumphant return of his character who was now radiating a wise\\, mysterious vibe\\, performing at a similar level as Harrison Ford but more personal within Luke's circumstance. His \\\"twin sister\\\" Carrie Fisher performed her final role right before her passing\\, and her spirit was given an honorably loving memory while the actress performed at her typically great charisma. The newer blood added more energy and emotions to their characters as each were given an arc that took them through tougher obstacles.\\n\\nWith the narrative being mainly character-driven\\, the usual action sequences are seemingly fewer this time\\, responding to built-up turns and energized by stunning visual effects (and production merits as part of the traditional usage of opportune practical effects with the scale measured by nice cinematography). The character-driven format is the story's reflective meditation\\, downsizing the amount of action to be outbursts that really expresses the opera part of its genre when it gets too powerful\\, as well being exhilarating with increased thrills to the point of gripping. Those two typical plot offerings share a connection through John Williams' composed score that still brings out the film's inner magnificence in a scene. The new Star Wars chapter sure did raised the bar for an exciting ride.\\n\\nThe sci-fi franchise continues to offer new experiences since 2015\\, with the latest \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" containing a significant addition into the lore with twists and speculative ambiguity\\, favorably delivered action and further dynamic of the updated characterization\\, through the explored and reflective depth\\, along with the continuous nostalgia to make this the most fun despite the intended darker route. That route may not be heavy at first but it's justified by the overdone grimness\\, which is the only lingering problem - and also a little to the sense of purpose on few narrative elements - that was taken a little too far in the weight. After watching the middle chapter\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" leaves you wanting more into the final chapter of the current trilogy after resulting to be at least the best\\, by most favorite\\, Star Wars yet.
