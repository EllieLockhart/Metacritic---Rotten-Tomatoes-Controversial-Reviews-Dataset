Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A refreshing and original episode compared to the force awakens\\, much like empire strikes back was at the time compared to a new hope. I really enjoyed it\\, except the Rose+Finn subplot at canto bight which could have been dropped to reduce the runtime to 2h and focus more on Luke+Rey +Kylo which was the best part of the script and delivered the most interesting performance and dialogues. The action scenes are top notch and some of the best directed ones of the entire saga with its large steady shots (no hysterical cuts) especially during the fight with the preatorian guards. A great movie\\, a great Star Wars episode that finally delivers novelty and risks for the new trilogy.","true":true}
