Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILER WARNING* This film is totally overhated. While i'll admit it's got flaws\\, i think the way they killed off many of the characters were completely justified. Captain Phasma needed to be killed. They completed her story arc. Throw her on the chopping block if you don't need her in the story anymore. Snoke's death was also justified. We thought he was the next Palpatine... And we all thought he was the most powerful being in the galaxy. Having Kylo kill him showed you how powerful Kylo really is\\, and he became Supreme Leader. I think Skywalker's death was god awful though. Total waste of a fan favorite character. And while sure\\, the film has pacing issues\\, it wasn't horrible. All in all\\, it's a solid star wars film. Not great\\, not bad. It's just there. And if you can get over a few terribly placed jokes\\, some small pacing issues\\, and Luke's unjustified ending\\, i think you'll have a fun time.\\n I'll give it \\n         - 65%","true":true}
