Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what the deal is\\, but I thought it was a great movie\\, but then again I liked The Force Awakens too. So much information packed into that 2 1\/2 hours\\, and things are definitely concluding for this saga while setting up a platform for new stories within the universe. The opening battle was nice and later in the movie when that one ship blows up was epic. Guess everyone just wants comedies right now... ","true":true}
