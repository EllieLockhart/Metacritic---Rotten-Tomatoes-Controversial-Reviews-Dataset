Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought the day would come when a film would knock The Empire Strikes Back off the number 1 spot in my all time favourite films\\, but The Last Jedi did that for me. Rian Johnson is one of my favourite directors\\, so I was excited when he was announced as Director and was blown away by the film. If you haven't seen Brick\\, you need to watch it immediately. \\n\\nCan't wait to see his new trilogy of films!","true":true}
