Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just about the only things not wrong with this movie are the genders of any given character. This was just sad. Poorly done. Odd editing choices\\, fall flat humor. Disney can do better with Star Wars\\, Rogue One proved it. Seriously\\, Episode 8 and the best they can offer is a space ship chase a half way competent fleet commander could have ended literally immediately after it began? (envelopment\\, it's a thing)\\, a really dumb casino plot that's objectives could have easily been better accomplished... look if I tear this apart we'll be here all week\\, and you're not reading this any way. Bottom line? Not a awful movie\\, but an awful Star Wars movie.","true":true}
