Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being brought up on star wars there hasn't been a single film I have disliked... but... this is up there with the best for me. Maybe because I read comics more away from the Skywalker family. This was gripping\\, testing and all out amazing. It had flaws yeah but it's STAR WARS!!","true":true}
