Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was no story-arch.  There was no heroes-journey.  There was no growth via struggle for our protagonist.  She starts off super awesome and she remains super awesome.  Luke did not even get to train her and she goes around lifting up mountains.  Come on... Even SuperMan has a good heroes-journey and he could beat all these jedi combined.","true":true}
