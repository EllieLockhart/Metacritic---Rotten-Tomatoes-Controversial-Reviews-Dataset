It has people talking and dividing opinions and i think that\u2019s what they set out to do. Most people wanted a copy or something very similar to the first. They wasn\u2019t going to do that. I found myself being shocked about the route I was taking or they was making me take. I hated Abby and couldn\u2019t wait to get to kill her. Then when I was taking charge of her I didn\u2019t want to. By the end I wanted her to live and take lev to the fire flys. I wanted Ellie to just cut her down and get in the boat and walk away. That\u2019s the only change I would make to this game. She would just get in the boat not say a word and leave instead of the fight that ensues. By killing Joel they wanted to give you the ammunition to fight for revenge when abbys fight for revenge has the same right to be heard. Also away for story it also has improved the combat and other game mechanics ten fold. It\u2019s a great sequel and that\u2019s just what is a sequel. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t take away from how great the first one was. I hope for a third is they take it away from this line of story and maybe find a new story in the universe where they could be endless story\u2019s to tell.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
