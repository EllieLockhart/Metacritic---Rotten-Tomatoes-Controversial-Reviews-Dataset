Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely loved it and I look forward very much to repeated viewings! I think the movie did a really good job of effectively passing on the torch of maintaining the Resistance to the younger characters\\, but I am very interested to see how they'll move forward without Carrie Fisher. I thought that Rey was particularly wonderful--she makes me think of Adam from \\\"Good Omens.\\\" She's an immensely important character who doesn't realize her own importance and\\, I think\\, being sort of on the outside of the Jedi and the Sith will help her realize whatever her place will be. I'd have liked a little more Finn\\, but I loved the development  the movie gave him toward acts of real courage that he wasn't guilted or forced into taking. I do agree with the criticism that the kiss at the end feels a bit out of place\\, but I felt like he and Rose had some really good chemistry and I'm not mad about it--I just think it could have been done a little differently. I enjoyed the more lighthearted moments. They reminded me of some of the better comedic beats from the original trilogy. I look forward to noticing more details in future re-watches!","true":true}
