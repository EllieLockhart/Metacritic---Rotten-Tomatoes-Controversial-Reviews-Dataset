Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney's SJW mission has the same faults as the people who push them\\, while it makes light of some great female characters it comes at a cost for others and vilifies or excludes them\\, it's only place for white males is as the bad guy or the cranky old guy who used to be the biggest optimist in the Galaxy (great writing there idiots).  And on that note it also hits on the last acceptable discrimination\\, ageism.\\n\\nKnow the way around this? Stop writing with an agenda in mind and start writing good stories. Rey is a great character\\, if she and Luke had teamed up it wouldn't not have diminished that in any way.  It could have been Rey vs Kylo and Snoke vs Luke.\\n\\nSW used to be about a bunch of Rebels no matter their background fighting back against an evil Empire.  Now it's got all this unnecessary baggage.","true":true}
