Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an absolute insult to Star Wars and to the very fans who made Star Wars what it is today\\, the FANS ARE STAR WARS\\, our money helped make these films what they are\\, now the fans have been insulted with this blasphemous film\\, it is an outrage! And the treatment of the old characters was disgraceful. Those involved in the writing and making of this film should be ashamed of themselves. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
