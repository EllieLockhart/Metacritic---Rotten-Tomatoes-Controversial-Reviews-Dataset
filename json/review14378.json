Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had been waiting for literally 30 years to see Han\\, Luke and Leia again\\, and for two years I was on the edge of my seat to see what would happen when Rey handed Luke that saber. And then this movie literally threw all that on the ground and laughed at it. Laughed at ME for being excited to see Luke as an elder statesman\\, highest level Jedi warrior. They portrayed Luke Skywalker\\, one of the greatest hero figures in cinematic history\\, as a goofy hermit milking a strange beast on an island\\, unwilling to do anything except crack jokes. I'm not saying it needed to be about Luke... I love Rey\\, I will follow her forever but the plot holes\\, trying-too-hard humor\\, and outright rejection of everything awesome that our heroes fought for in all the other movies was a real bummer. Laaaaaame! For the record - Luke would never ever ever make the choices they had him do in this movie. He had left a frakkin' map\\, y'all. Please JJ fix this mess. Love\\, huge Star Wars fan forever xoxo","true":true}
