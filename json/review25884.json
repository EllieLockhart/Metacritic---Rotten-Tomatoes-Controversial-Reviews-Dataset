Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good in any substantial way. It could've been fixed pretty easily\\, if Rey had become evil and it would've been great if she had lost her hand but unfortunately it was bland and I have no real interest in the next movie. \\nThe CGI was beautiful and some of the actors were amazing\\, but the characters sucked and the plot was broken sure it was basically there but really really broken.","true":true}
