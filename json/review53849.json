Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey RT\\, stop propping up the audience score! This movie was crap\\, and with the OVERWHELMING number of negative reviews there is no way this movie is still sitting at 51% positive. The only people who will like this movie are idiots\\, feminists\\, and leftists\\, but I'm being redundant.","true":true}
