Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen the astonishingly low audience ratings\\, I was worried--until I saw that most of the reviewers stating their dislike were complaining about the 'sjw stuff'. As a veteran fan of the Star Wars series\\, I can say--what the hell do you think Star Wars is about\\, if not achieving justice and overcoming oppression? But anyway\\, on the the important part of this review: IT WAS FANTASTIC AND YOU SHOULD SEE IT. The lessons of this movie are echoed back and forth between the multiple plotlines and characters in a way that is very clear\\, without at any point being pedantic. The characters were evolved in a deeply satisfying manner--the choices made in this story may not have been predicted\\, but they are very much true to the people making them. Even the 'casino planet' plot\\, much decried as gratuitous\\, was serving a very specific purpose\\, to highlight a lesson that Yoda himself thinks important enough to state. This was a transition movie\\, and in echo of its spiritual forebear\\, The Emperor Strikes Back\\, there is great loss\\, crushing failure\\, and questioning of the self--but TLJ is handling this in its own way\\, and showing us what can arise in the wake of destruction. This movie is a passing of the torch; Carrie Fisher's death is a tragedy that has no bright side\\, but the homage of this movie is at least appropriate--the fight continues\\, new hands take the helm\\, and the old masters can rest in the knowledge that they gave all they could to those who carry on in their stead.","true":true}
