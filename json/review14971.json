Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just returned from a second viewing with my 9 year old son\\, and I have to say I was really swept up by the film.  Loved the characters\\, the emotional sweep\\, and gorgeous visuals. I'm so pleased this movie dared to be a little weird too.  Stay weird Star Wars.  And Luke's arc was tragic and wonderful.  Such an interesting and sensitive portrayal of the character.  I saw the film at an 11 am Wednesday matinee in a small city\\, well over a week after release.  The theater was about 3\/4 full.  Everyone seemed to be really vibing with the movie.  People were laughing at the jokes\\, and gasping and cheering at the dramatic scenes.  Lots of folks stayed through the end credits.","true":true}
