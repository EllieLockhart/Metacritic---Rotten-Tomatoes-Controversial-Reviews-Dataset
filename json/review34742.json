{"101487":173871,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The debates rage on.  So picking up where The Force Awakens left off\\, our heroes are split up.  Rey is on a scarcely populated planet\\, trying to convince Luke to give her Jedi training.  Elsewhere\\, the Resistance is trying desperately not to be completely snuffed out by the First Order\\, and this is Star Wars\\, so you know they are going to be trying their damnedest to bring that scale to the epic level.  Now while there are certainly plenty of fans out there that take this series more seriously than I do\\, I do consider myself a fan and get pumped up whenever a new Star Wars movie comes out (and with Disney taking the reins\\, that's going to be on an annual basis (if not more)).  It took me longer than opening weekend to find the time to watch this with a beefy 152 minute runtime\\, but of course I was excited for this.  Even when people were coming out this with polarizing reactions to the extreme\\, I still was giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Surprisingly\\, I don't feel all that strongly about it upon watching it.  I didn't hate it\\, I didn't love it\\, I just modestly liked it.  While The Force Awakens was more or less a remake of A New Hope\\, it was absolutely necessary to get the series back on track.  This is the first movie where they really could finally start taking some riskier chances in the story department\\, and it really feels like that is the direction that they are pushing this series towards.  For me\\, this is a movie of two parts: the finale and the 90 minute setup.  I do like where they are taking all of these characters\\, so the opening of this is needed\\, but one thing I feel was really lacking in this portion was surprises in the storytelling.  I wasn't mapping out where it was going\\, because I was invested in each individual scene\\, but every plotline played out as I expected it to\\, especially in regards to character interactions.  The last hour is where this really brought it around\\, and that is where the majority of the action\\, thrills\\, and just cool abilities really come into play.  They do introduce new elements that I don't think that they have done before (and it looks like they are thankfully retconning midichlorians)\\, and I am cool with most of them\\, but there is one that really yanked me out of the movie\\, you might be able to pinpoint it when you see it.  I really like these new characters as they all have so many different directions where their stories can go\\, but the standout to me in this is Adam Driver as Kylo Ren.  I love that he throws temper tantrums and that he is such a wannabe bad guy.  It actually gives him a really strong sense of pathos\\, even with him being on the dark side.  I do think it gets a little too CGI in parts\\, but at the same time\\, I love all of the animal additions to this world (I am now the proud owner of a Porg in my home).  I think that The Last Jedi is a bit overlong\\, but it has plenty of high quality elements within that runtime.  I think this is a good movie\\, but it is not something that I feel overly passionately about.","true":true}
