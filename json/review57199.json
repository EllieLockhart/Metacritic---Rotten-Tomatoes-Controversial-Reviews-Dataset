Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is without doubt the worst film to come out of the Star Wars paddock. A non sensical CGI centric plot\\, little to no character development\\, no questions answered or asked\\, preposterous portrayals of established characters and an overwhelming sense of \\\"so what\\\" when leaving the cinema. Rian Johnson\\, even though a self professed Star Wars fan\\, clearly has no comprehension of how the franchise has got to where it is - this has done irredeemable damage to the image of Star Wars. I wish this could be erased and JJ Abrams could continue the story and character development that he laid the foundations for in the Force Awakens rather than having to resort to this shambolic attempt at storytelling strewn with awful\\, irrelevant jokes . . . Other than that\\, it was great (and just in case you couldn't tell\\, that last comment was me being sarcastic)","true":true}
