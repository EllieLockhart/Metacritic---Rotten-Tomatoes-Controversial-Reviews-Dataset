Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just a silly silly movie with the most ILLOGICAL storyline and characters you not only dont loke in the movie but Now feel actual disgust with the actual actors for their part in this disasterous and shamefull exploitation of a fan base. All marketing and nothing else. Its not even about it being an AWFUL sequalized star wars which of course it is\\, this movie would be terrible if there never had Been the Originals.   People wonder why movie viewership is down? Well its bc you can almost GUARANTEE each big release is simply a giant money grab and has to be a hige scam to portray it as being such a high budget bc there is absolutely no one with any sense in Disney who watched this and thought it was good.   They just knew peOple would watch it so they could care less about the actual quality of it. Just miserable this movie.","true":true}
