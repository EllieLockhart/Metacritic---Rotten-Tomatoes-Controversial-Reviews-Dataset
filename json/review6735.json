Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t listen to all the negative reviews honestly. Go see the movie and form your own opinion. I\u2019ve always been a huge Star Wars fan and this movie has gone into areas of Star Wars we\u2019ve never seen on screen before and it\u2019s 100% worth seeing. Overall the acting\\, battle scenes\\, and effects were fantastic. Couldn\u2019t ask for more from a movie like this.","true":true}
