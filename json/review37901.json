Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script was rife with tired and overused plot devices and the story dragged on for far too long. All of the plot sub stories were a distraction and the attempts at humor an even bigger distraction.","true":true}
