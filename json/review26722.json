Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, this movie isn't perfect: the first act goes really slowly; the whole Finn\/Rose plot is sometimes boring and we have the feeling that Rian Johnson just didn't care about what the fans wanted to have. But come on\\, this movie was just fantastic! First of all Luke\\, he's the coolest character in the whole galaxy\\, I really liked his evolution and of course Yoda's return too. His arc is made very well and the end was epic\\, this is maybe one of the best Star Wars moments ever\\, also his reunion with Leia was pure magic. Also Kylo and Rey's connection was pretty cool and their fight with the Praetorian Guards and the whole throne room scene in general were badass. Mark Hamill's performance was the best. I also loved Carrie Fisher's last performance\\, and Adam Driver's was also pretty cool... A stunning film\\, the best Star Wars movie since 1980.","true":true}
