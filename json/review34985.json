Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was above average in cinematography\\, sound\\, lighting etc but the narrative was given so many chances to really give the fans what they wanted and create jaw dropping moments. This didnt happen.\\n\\nAlot of the plot was just strung up from previous episodes and made into a different context with different characters.\\n\\nYes there was a feeling of nostalgia and that was epic but Disney just had to go and add these animals in for humour\\, which get more screen time than key characters to the entire franchise.This really killed the vibe as it made the film more 'funny' than how serious the fans wanted it to be. \\nIt many kep plot points and shouldnt be aided with this childish humour\\, it should be serious\\, because it is.\\n\\nThis franchise means somethnig to people\\, for some it has been their entire life. Disney has ruined an amazing franchise with their demographic grabbing marketing\\, toys and bad narrative.","true":true}
