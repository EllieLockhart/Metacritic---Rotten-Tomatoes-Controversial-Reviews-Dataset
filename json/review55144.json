Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was totally one of the fans hating on this movie hardcore for about a week after I first saw in\\, but then I watched it a second time (and a third\\, and a fourth) and very begrudgingly had to eat my words. This movie is incredible!  I am a die hard Star Wars fan; I've seen every movie\\, every episode of Clone Wars\/Rebels\\, read every comic. I think the reason people really either hate or love this movie is because us die-hard fans cling to what we've come to expect from the Star Wars universe (a theme that is thoroughly driven home throughout TLJ). Once you can watch \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" with some of your biases taken away\\, you realize the genius of what Rian Johnson created.\\n\\nI have a few gripes...I can never forgive the scene with the \\\"milk walrus\\\"\\, and I also wish that more time was devoted to Rey's training on the island\\, but in the end I really loved the movie. I would even go so far as to say it's one of my favorites! So...food for thought\\, for those of you who haven't seen it yet.  I hated it the first time I watched it\\, really liked it the second time\\, then fell in love with it the third time.","true":true}
