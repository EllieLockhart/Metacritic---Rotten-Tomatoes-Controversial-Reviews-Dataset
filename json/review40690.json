Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This just seemed disjointed and was not true to the series.  It was all over the place and felt a little cartoon like in its delivery.  I don't mind seeing characters dying but to destroy Luke and make him weak and wimpy was a disservice to the fan base.  I hope that this director never touches another star wars movie again!  I also hope Disney steps away from something it clearly does not know how to develop ( a good believable story line)  This movie looked like and felt like it was made by committee","true":true}
