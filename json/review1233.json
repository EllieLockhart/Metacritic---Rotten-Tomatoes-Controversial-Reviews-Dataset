Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A powerful\\, sprawling\\, and above all else fresh Star Wars tale. It takes a brave director and a brace crew to push beyond the mold of a franchise so beloved. And a very talented hand to make it all work so spectacularly.","true":true}
