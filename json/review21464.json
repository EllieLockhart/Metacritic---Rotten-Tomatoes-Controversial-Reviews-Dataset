Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would give this movie negative stars if I could. From such a promising setup in The Force Awakens\\, Rian Johnson has given us nothing but disappointment\\, plotholes\\, bad writing\\, and illogical story-telling. I could list all instances of it here\\, but it would take way too long to write it all out. And anyone who has watched the film already knows what they are. I would love to know how much Disney has paid to the critics who are giving this movie a 90-something percent rating. The movie is downright awful. End of story.","true":true}
