Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They're doing too much with this one. The story is not very well thought-out. Leia flying through space is the most absurd thing in all of the Star Wars movies. This one isn't up to the standard of the Star Wars brand but relative to other movies in general\\, it's fine.","true":true}
