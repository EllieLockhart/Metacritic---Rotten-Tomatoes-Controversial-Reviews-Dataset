Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a Star Wars fan since '87.  Grew up with the originals.  Was disappointed by the prequels\\, but still enjoyed them as Star Wars films.  I loved Force Awakens.  I really liked the Last Jedi\\, but didn't love it like I loved the Force Awakens.  I could feel the hand off from one director's vision to another.  It didn't flow like I was expecting it to.  With that said\\, I still really liked the vision Rian Johnson had for the film.  It was unexpected throughout.  I was still left with wanting something more by the credits.  I don't know if this was intentional or if it was because it skipped over many plot holes created by Force Awakens with no explanation (Who's that Snoke guy???).  Overall I give this a good rating because it still felt like a Star Wars film and the story line was very enjoyable.  Cinematography was great\\, editing was on par.  I can see why the Star Wars lore fanatics hate this movie.  I feel like this movie's quirks was intentionally made to piss them off.  For someone who genuinely loves Star Wars\\, I had no qualms with it.","true":true}
