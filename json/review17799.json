Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like a true Star Wars movie in every sense. It seemed they took the main criticism from ep 7 & developed an original story (i know there\u2019s books but idc). I felt like the universe expanded and we followed the main characters in their development. Great movie! ","true":true}
