Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand what they've done to the Star Wars universe... The bombers make no sense\\, like why do they move so slow?...\\n\\nWhy did they tear Luke apart?... What do the characters barely develop?... Who is Snoke?... There were no answers to answer what happened since Luke left... But then Luke dies... What?","true":true}
