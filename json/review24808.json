Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Muy\\, muy\\, muy decepcionado. Esto no es Star Wars\\, es otra cosa. Quiz\u00e1s es lo que est\u00e1n buscando las nuevas generaciones\\, pero yo no. Me da miedo pensar que este director se encargar\u00e1 de la cuarta trilog\u00eda porque me parece ver estar muriendo Star Wars. Giros de gui\u00f3n absurdos\\, escenas de lucha con sables l\u00e1ser rid\u00edculas\\, etc. Estoy muy disgustado.","true":false}
