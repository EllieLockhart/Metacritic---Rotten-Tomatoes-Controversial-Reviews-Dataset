Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible pacing\\, alot of downtime with the boring and pointless side-plot. Alot of shoehorned in comedic relief moments that are cringe worthy. Not to mention the movie's FIRST SCENE is a comedy moment. Pretending to be on hold? Really Star Wars? I audibly laughed out loud at multiple points in the movie (and they weren't the parts where they were trying to be funny.) Not too impressed with this one. Possible among the bottom 3 worst SW films in my opinion.","true":true}
