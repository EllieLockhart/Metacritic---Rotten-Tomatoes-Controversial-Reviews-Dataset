Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't kid yourself this is not a star wars movie. It seems to me that the directors intentionally downgraded the legend Luke Skywalker in order to further their own characters (namely Kylo and Rey).","true":true}
