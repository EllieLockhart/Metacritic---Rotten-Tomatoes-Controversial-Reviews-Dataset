Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks Disney\\, I no longer have a reason to care about Star Wars. You killed off many of the reasons Star Wars became so loved and embraced. \\n\\nWhere were the \\\"creatures\\\"? Where was the character development? Why so many \\\"stupid\\\" people? You made Yoda look like an unhinged old fool\\, why? You made immense weapons of destruction look flimsy! You despatched aged and well known characters with nary a care!  \\n\\nThe suspension of disbelief required by audiences to accept that so many noobs can become seasoned hero's and technical experts with no training beggars belief. Keep peddling that tripe\\, sheeple are everywhere. You'll always have the whales. \\n\\nI feel sorry for Chewy\\, R2\\, and 3PO - keep a stiff upper lip and best of luck to you three. \\n\\nOh it was very pretty to watch\\, the visuals were splendid... so you know what\\, I change my mind\\, it was a great movie after all (for the Americans\\, that was sarcasm).","true":true}
