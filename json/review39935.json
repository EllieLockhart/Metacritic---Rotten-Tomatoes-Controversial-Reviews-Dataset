Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily the best of the new trilogy\\, and only entry I'd label an actual film\\, where the others feel like extended commercial-free tv. This is an intriguing chapter that wasn't given much to build upon\\, but shows a much more professional grasp of dialogue\\, character arcs and editing than the two films which bookend it.","true":true}
