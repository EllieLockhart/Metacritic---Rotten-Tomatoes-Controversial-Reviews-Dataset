Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could rate it lower I would. Simply put it's liberal nonsense forced into a Star Wars movie and it saddens me that this is Carrie Fishers final outing and could be Mark Hamill's last star wars movie.","true":true}
