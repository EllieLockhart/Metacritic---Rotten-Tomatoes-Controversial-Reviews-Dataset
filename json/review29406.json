Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did not ruin my childhood\\, my parents did\\, he did however make a terribly incoherent 150+ minute film about running out of gas in space. This film should have been shot digitally\\, it's sad actual filmstock was wasted  on this garbage. Star Wars didn't need to go out like this.","true":true}
