Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After multiple viewings\\, digesting the film and the controversy surrounding this film I have come to the conclusion that they are valid criticisms. There are more then enough cringe worthy lines of dialogue littered throughout the film. In contrast to Marvel films many of the dialogue and interactions between characters is comedic and often flows nicely regardless of tone. But this is Star Wars not the MCU and is completely fails to immerse you in to the Star Wars world. This makes the characters feel out of place and out of character. The fact of the matter is that we have 3-4 films of character development for Luke and Leia and in this film you would not know that since it basically throws away everything that was established in previous films which in this case works against the film. The plot is extremely weak and littered with plot-holes through-out. The subsequent release of comics and other media that try to explain how and why things happened in the movie I think highlight that these plot holes are real.\\nIn Summary the movie fails to capture you with uninspiring dialogue and a dull plot. The new characters introduced in the film fail to bring anything of value and impede the development of the previously interesting and mysterious characters introduced in The Force Awakens.","true":true}
