Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I've never been so disappointed in a game in my whole life.

TheyI've never been so disappointed in a game in my whole life. As a huge fan it hurts me to know that I gave naughty dog money for this. I avoided all leaks\\, bought the special edition of this\\, got the tlou edition ps4 years back\\, beat the original close to 10 times (mostly on grounded difficulty) and played thousands of matches of the multiplayer across the ps3 and ps4 versions. They betrayed the people like me who helped pay for this sequel and waited 7 years. For what? All so that Anita Sarkeesian can beat gamers to death with a golf club\\, spit on us\\, steal the spotlight\\, punch us in the face\\, break our arm\\, bite our gaming fingers off and just walk off as the main character? I beat it twice\\, so this is not a BS review. The game is an actual 5-6 based on gameplay and graphics\/sound. It's a fun game and the voice acting is great\\, but I have to give it a 0 for story and in general\\, because of all the fake 10s and Neil Druckmann lying to us. You don't have to be some right wing trump voter to hate this game. You just have to be somebody who wanted a good story. With all the forced virtue signaling\\, the game sacrifices the story in favor of sending some message. Trust a hardcore fan and save your money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
