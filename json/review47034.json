Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disaster of a movie the force awakins was a decent first installment of the reboot of the series but at this point they killed of everyone I cared about in vain. There is no possible way to fix all these problems in the last film. For a better explanation watch the angry joe review it explains all these points. I am just a fan not the youtuber","true":true}
