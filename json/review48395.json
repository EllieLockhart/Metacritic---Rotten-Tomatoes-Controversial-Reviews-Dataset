Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a lot of the connective tissue to the main trilogy ( and even the prequel trilogy) severed\\, The Last Jedi unapologetically steamrolls ahead into new territory. While bold and wildly entertaining\\, it makes this viewer far less interested in the next chapter. The Last Jedi wants to be its own thing ; almost like one of the movies in the newly announced Star Wars trilogy dropped a little sooner.","true":true}
