Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie and for the most part I did. However there water definitely some questionable choice's for story plots which is causing most of the controversy. See the movie for yourself and make your own determination. It was good\\, just not great. ","true":true}
