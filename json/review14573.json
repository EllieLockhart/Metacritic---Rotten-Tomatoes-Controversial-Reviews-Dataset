Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a huge Star Wars fan my whole life. I thought it was awesome. The whole family loved it. The force awakens was good but it was just telling the same old story where as the last Jedi is able to tell a new and fresh story. Really don't get the bad reviews. If people just wanted the same Star Wars remake then watch the originals or the force awakens over and over.","true":true}
