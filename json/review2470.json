Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very pretty\\, substance-less film... I understand the director tried something new with this film but it never fully lives up to any of it's ambitious goals. Instead\\, it fails on many fronts\\, most notably characters who meander about with no clear direction or purpose. True\\, the purpose of the film was\\, \\\"to learn from failure\\,\\\" but when I spend an entire movie watching characters fail repeatedly\\, I don't feel like waiting for the next movie until I see them \\\"learn\\\" anything","true":true}
