Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want a recycled plot\\, deus ex machina\\, cliche\\, and questionable acting (luking at you Mark ;)\\, then this movie has it all. From a 25th hour retcon of a classic character\\, to a pointless ideological message (of some sort) crammed down your throat in a segment of the movie that might make you fall asleep.\\n\\nWow. Just Wow. And I thought the Force Awakens was terrible\\, way to go disney\\, you have made a movie worse than AoTC.","true":true}
