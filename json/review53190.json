Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before starting to write about the movie itself\\, I want to express how I felt about the last movie in the franchise - The Force Awakens. I do not like it. The plot is boring\\, the fights are really not that good\\, the characters are pretty cheesy and boring and most of all\\, it just didn't feel as Star Wars to me. But this movie was a different story. Even though I did not like the characters in the first movie\\, now I am really starting to connect to them\\, and even to like them. The movie felt like a continuation to the long legacy of Star Wars\\, which to me is most important thing. I think that reaching this feeling is a really hard thing to achieve because even George Lucas himself\\, the man who created Star Wars\\, created the prequels\\, the movies which are basically have Anti-Star Wars feeling to them. The story is nice\\, with even a character from the past appearing\\, it raises some interesting questions and gives awesome and enjoyable action. There is a lot of character development\\, and we get to see sides of the characters which we did not see before. But\\, of course there are some mistakes. I did not like the subplot that much\\, and thought it was too time consuming and a bit cringe-worthy\\, the same thing I think about the humor. I have never seen humor as part of the Star Wars franchise\\, and I think its use in The Force Awakens was just terrible. In this movie it is much less terrible\\, but it harms the Star Wars feel the movie has. I really liked the movie and felt that it was an improvement from the last. Too bad J.J. Abrams is going to direct the next movie...","true":true}
