Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly entertained by TLJ\\, and I plan to see it again in the theater. All the haters complaining about a lack of plot or character development must have been asleep for most of the movie. Just because they didn't like the direction the story went in doesn't mean that there was no development. News flash people: it's 2017\\, not 1977.  Give the fan boys a retread of episodes 4-6\\, and everyone will be complaining about the franchise being formulaic and predictable (kind of like they did for TFA). The story has to move forward and I'm happy with the overall result of of the latest installment. I've got a few quibbles with some of the minor plot points\\, but by and large\\, the themes work well. Anyone who was a fan of the expanded universe stuff knows that these characters are flawed and not the mythological beings that they've built them up to be in their minds. In my opinion\\, this story was about failure and redemption\\, with the characters playing variously on both sides of the equation. Well done and worth the trip to the theater. I can't wait for the blu-ray.","true":true}
