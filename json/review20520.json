Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve been watching Star Wars for 3 1\/2 decades. The prequels weren\u2019t nearly as bad as the shallowness of this movie! It shows the depth of a child\u2019s writing\\, killing off Luke Skywalker without any Real Bang. Truly\\, Rian Johnson \\, Move along... There were so many opportunities to create an epic tale\\, and basically they chose stupidity in their decisions over making a movie that MOST everyone new and old enjoyed. The original Star Wars was done with passion a small budget\\, and true creativity. This was nothing like that but a shadow of Star Wars former self. Rogue One was way better than this crap... Usually\\, I would have seen Star Wars 4 times already in the movies. I saw this once and could careless if I ever saw a Star Wars movie again. LET THE PAST DIE... cos they just KILLED it! LITERALLY.","true":true}
