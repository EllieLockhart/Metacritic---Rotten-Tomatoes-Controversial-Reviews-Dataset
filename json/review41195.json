Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has so many errors\/inconsistencies in its characters reasoning and basic decision making that you start to wonder if it was written by a thirdgrader. Visually it's a great movie\\, but given the expectations for a SW movie\\, it is plain disappointing.","true":true}
