Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga! its gorgeous visual effects\\, shocking and unpredictable film that continues the Skywalker story beautifully. Mark Hamill is great and always will be as Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson brilliantly creates the magic with some risks that paid off. after watching the film I also realised older Star Wars fans may find it hard to accept what they see in this film. they even now say the most hateful things towards the film but its only cause they r very much attached to the original trilogy that they would have grown up with that again its hard for them to accept what it is now. but once again a great film.","true":true}
