Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Podrian haberlo hecho todo bien\\, el Ep7 habia sido flojo pero dejaba un potencial. Rian Johnson no estuvo a la altura\\, pareci\u00f3 una historia improvisada\\, dejo de lado personajes emblem\u00e1ticos\\, no fue una pelicula de SW. No importa hacer calidad sino hacer dinero. Esto es Disney.","true":false}
