Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome acting but that's it. The writing is so bad it's sorrowing. Why kill Snoke? Why so many \\\"gotcha\\\" moments. I feel like they took the Force Awakens criticisms of it being a \\\"rehash\\\" to seriously and tried to dupe the audience way too many times. Basically they writers disregarded every major expectation to the point of being absolutely annoying. I was going to 3\/5 but I have to one star this. Such incompetence by the writers.","true":true}
