Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wrong on so many levels of story telling. Disney has created yet another Star Wars film with no main character\\, no character archs\\, and changed the fundamental character of Luke Skywalker. They also killed the storylines they alluded to in The Force Awakens. By trying to be so unpredictable\\, they have failed to give us a good Star Wars story. They have flash over substance but Carrie fisher and Mark Hamill still shine in this film inspite of the flaws. They are the only saving grace and neither of them can return to the next film.","true":true}
