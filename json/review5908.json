Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing\\,  Iill-judged \\\"humour\\\" and it's far too long.  I'm not going to bother going to see ep IX after this shambles. The producers have dropped the ball. Here's hoping solo keeps up the side like Rogue One did.","true":true}
