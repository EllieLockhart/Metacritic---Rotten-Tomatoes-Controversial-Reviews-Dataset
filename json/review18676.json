Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I tried but could not like it... there are a few scenes that LOOK amazing so kudos for that... but the story is slow\\, makes no sense and ultimately I just wanted to be over to I could get out of there... a first for any Star Wars movie","true":true}
