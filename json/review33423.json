Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TBH I'm not really that into Star Wars. I felt this film had a slow start and and too many unreasonable character decisions. However\\, I feel it was the best Star Wars movie yet. I love the retro sci fi set design for Snoke's lair. I appreciate the war profiteering message and Benicio Del Toro was so good as a chaotic character. I agree with Mark Hamill that Luke's character would never have given up\\, but even with all of that\\, this is the first Star Wars movie I found myself connected to. I don't care that Rey is untrained with a lightsaber but still a total badass - her magic fighting ability is more believable than an entire military corps unable to shoot someone down a straight hall. Rey is the hero I want to succeed. I did have to use the rest room during the Yoda scene\\, so maybe whatever I missed is the reason so many fan boys are slamming this movie. I don't understand the bad reviews at all.","true":true}
