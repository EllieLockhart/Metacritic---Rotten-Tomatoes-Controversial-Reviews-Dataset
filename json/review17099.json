Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this installment of Star Wars. There were a few things I didn\u2019t like but not enough to detract from the overall enjoyment. I like where the story is going for the characters. I enjoyed the character development and a majority of their arcs. ","true":true}
