Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is 2 hours 30 minutes long and 20 minutes deep.  The narrative is the spectacle of CGI.  The suspension of disbelief falls short as so many major plot points deviate so drastically from the characters and world that Lucas established.  The surprising twists are twists because they don't make sense or contradict established characterizations and lore.  Some contradictions occur in the same film (shields\\, the vacuum of space\\, hyperdrive\\, the Force\\, etc.).   As a science fiction movie\\, this is movie is better than some\\, worse than others.  As a Star Wars movie\\, it does a disservice to the franchise.","true":true}
