Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very good movie! Apart from a number of mistakes which may have ruined\/degraded the viewing experience of some cinema goers. For example\\, Leia randomly flying back into the ship wish bizarre and unnecessary\\, general ackbar (an already known and loved  character) could have played a better 'second in command' and received a worthy death\\, there were no light saber fights\\, the Kylo Ren storyline was extremely predictable and too similar to the last movie\\, many also found Rose's character to be extremely underwhelming\\, captain phantasm got nerfed once again\\, Snoke got nerfed and we still know nothing about him ETC. All in all a decent flick\\, but a star wars movie could be so much better!","true":true}
