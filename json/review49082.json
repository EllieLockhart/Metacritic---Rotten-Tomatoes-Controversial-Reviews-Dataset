Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star wars movie ever. Filled with bad jokes\\, poor characters\\, makes no sense at all and especially disrespect de star wars franchise. I was so disappointed but I can't say that it surprised me coming from Disney. Don't support this piece of crap","true":true}
