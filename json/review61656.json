Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A game with pretty great gameplay but a mediocre story. They killed off Joel so early in the series just so they can dangle flashback scenes just to make you feel sad is just is ridiculous. I would have at least wanted to see some note of those moments before killing Joel off. Forcing you play as Abby for the whole second half of the game was a stupid decision on their part. They don't make her a likeable so you'd actually want to play as her at all before forcing you to. She's an adulterer with no remorse for killing Joel right after he saved her. I know Joel's crimes were atrocious but so are abby's and the whole WLF's. Pulling the whole: \\\"look how relatable and human these **** are... you know the ones who slaughtered people and whole towns. But look they've got dogs\\, families\\, kids\\, and schools. Ooo they didn't kill Ellie and Tommy because they weren't targeting them so they must be good people\\\" even though they're warmongers who've gotten an entire town that looks so impossibly perfect and pristine that its warmonger influences nowhere to be seen in it was so unbelievable that it just left a bad taste in my mouth. I understand the overall message\\, the execution was just awful. Thought I don't believe I don't believe my score should be as low as it is\\, I think Naughty Dog needs to get the message across that due to their track record and long 4+ year gaps they need to be held at a higher standard to what we ended up with this dissapointing game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
