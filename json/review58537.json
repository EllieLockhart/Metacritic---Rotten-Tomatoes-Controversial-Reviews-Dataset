It was never as good as the first one. In the first game\\, it was a story about two people traveling across the country and Joel having a second chance at having a daughter. It was truly a remarkable game and perfect storytelling wise. But in the second game it felt like telling a message more than a story. The game was telling me \u201cRevenge is bad\u201d over and over again. With Joel killing Abby\u2019s dad\\, Abby killing Joel\\, Ellie killing Abby\u2019s friends\\, and Abby killing Jesse\\, and the most disappointing part about Ellie not killing Abby as soon a she saw her. Part 2 was a horrible disappointment and I wish tlou was a standalone game. It\u2019s hard to make a perfect sequel after a perfect game. Gameplay wise it was fun. Basically the the first game but with improvements.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
