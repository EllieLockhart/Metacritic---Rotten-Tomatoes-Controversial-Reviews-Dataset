Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a pass\\, but nothing more than that.\\nDuring this whole year I have not seen a single Disney production movie\\, I hold them accountable for a mediocre film industry\\nSpending more money doesn't mean it is a good movie\\nI get it Thor and Spidey man where good movies but still \\nThey where not enough to draw me into the theater. \\nI had waited to break my hiatus for Star Wars the last jedi\\nBut it became another Meh! Movie from Disney.\\nSo many plot wholes\\, all of the villians where outsmarted \\nover and over again\\, It is hard to belive the almughty First\\nOrder is lead by morons specially Snoke in his speah saying that he can read Kylo's mind and still not knowing that he was going to get cut in half by him\\, it is just unbelievable . Then Finn's arc was so unnecessary and his love relationship was so forced and awkward. Literally the only character with future growth is Poe Dameron when Leia taght him a great lesson about \\nleadership and being a hero. And so forth I have a plethora of \\nissues with the movie\\, not personal but from the structure of the \\nfilm.\\nPd. The Red Royal guards felt more of a threat that any\\nother villian in the movie\\, props for the Red Guards","true":true}
