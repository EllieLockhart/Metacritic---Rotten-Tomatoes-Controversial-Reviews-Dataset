While Part II is not on the same level\\, it took a different path by creating a dark\\, nonlinear and mentally destructive tale of revenge making it one of my favorite games on PS4.\r\rThe strongest element of this game is the emotional trauma that happens within the first hour which only gets more painful as the story progresses.\r\rWhile exploring a meticulously crafted world where every abandoned room had a story to tell\\, I would catch myself standing and savouring the magnificent details unwilling to rush through a single meter. The music was divinely painful as every guitar string cut right in the heart. The brutal gameplay allowed Ellie to serve vengeance in the most horrific ways to NPCs that had names and often begged for mercy. Then suddenly\\, everything changed.\r\rI did not understand why did I have to play as Abby. I hated her\\, I hated how she looked\\, what she said and no matter who she helped I felt nothing but infernal hatred. As the hours passed\\, my resentment grew to the point of bursting that happened during her final encounter where I was literally screaming because of what I was forced to do. I hated the game and what it was putting me through.\r\rEven after switching back to Ellie\\, my heart kept pounding for an hour during which I realized that the point of Abby was not to show her personality but to fuel my hatred towards her and to further elevate my experience as Ellie. Mad with rage\\, I was ready for retribution but the last 10 impeccably crafted minutes changed everything. I felt Ellie's pain the entire game and yet\\, somehow I was ok with her decision.\r\rDuring the epilogue\\, I realized how much the game has played with my hopes and feelings by not allowing me to know where the story was going. It left me confused\\, bitter and empty. I was unsure of what I should be feeling because no other game has ever had such a non linear emotional experience. The saddest part happens every morning when I wake up and my heart aches because it's all over. 10\/10.\r\rMovies.shmovies on Instagram\u2026 Expand","true":true}
