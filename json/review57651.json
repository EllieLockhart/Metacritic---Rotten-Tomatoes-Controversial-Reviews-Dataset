Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To sum it up..\\n\\n- Space battles are as usual\\, too awesome to be true. Kudos for the amazing engineering behind it.\\n- I felt that the dramatic scenes fits the dim scenery very well. Ridley and Driver never seizes to amaze me in terms of acting. Superb job.\\n- Old fans won't appreciate the obvious changes\\, the passing of the torch. But I can swallow it. I'm an old timer fan\\, and I can still appreciate on what they do\\, what will be the outcome in Episode 9 or.. if we can still have Episode X and beyond.\\n- I was kinda disappointed for Leah's role (last performance for Fisher). Seems like she's all chill and be like \\\"don't yah worry kid. we got this!\\\". With just few one liners. Still\\, I appreciate for her appearance on screen our only princess Leah. \\n- There are some last pieces that I expected to be epic\\, and hell yes it was and I got still chills all over.\\n- We can obviously see the little by little introduction of some new characters to be loved by this generation. I can dig Rey\\, (though her too much British accent turns me off a bit!) she should take care of her sweet charm Rey \\\"cute badass\\\" persona.\\n- My favorite moment of the whole movie was the Yoda to Luke moment. And Yoda being not the Lucas CGI is a good thing.. Thank God!\\n\\n- A MUST F*CKING WATCH! What the hell are you waiting for!?","true":true}
