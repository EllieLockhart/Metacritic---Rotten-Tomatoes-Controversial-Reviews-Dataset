{"101487":150801,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOOK AT THE PROFILES OF PEOPLE LEAVING POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!!! I've noticed a few that were started within the past month or two that only have 0-2 other reviews\\, and they're all for movies that suck or aren't doing well in theaters.  Shills\\, indeed.\\n\\nHeard a rumor that Rotten Tomatoes doesn't count half-star reviews\\, so I'm changing mine to a 1 star.  Still counts negatively towards the audience score\\, so no harm in pretending like this movie is better than it actually is.\\n\\nAnd to the people saying that others on here are just giving it a low score because \\\"reasons\\,\\\" you are incredibly stupid individuals.  This movie is not liked\\, and people came here to share their opinion\\, just as you.  People have been very clear about what it is that they didn't like about this movie\\, and you are patently ignoring everything they've said when you accuse them of maliciously attacking this film.  You're either a very stupid and\/or dishonest individual\\, or you're a Disney shill (who are also stupid and dishonest people).  Quit attacking people who are trying to share their opinion about this movie\\, you're only making people hate this movie more because of your alienating attitude.\\n\\nHere is a copy of the email I sent to Disney regarding this movie:\\n\\n\\\"Hi\\, I just wanted someone at Disney to know how angry I was after seeing The Last Jedi.  \\n\\nI never expected a movie to get to me so much\\, but what you have put out is utter garbage.  I can't believe that a company would spend $4 billion to get their hands on a property\\, only to slap their story together with paste and scotch tape instead of taking the time to do something good with it.  Why did you not spend a year or two developing the plot of all three movies?  Why did you let Rian Johnson write this one by himself\\, instead of hiring qualified writers\\, or having JJ Abrams work on the script with him?  \\n\\nAlso\\, I'm almost positive that your company is responsible for strong-arming and\/or bribing critics into giving positive reviews\\, as well as hiring shills to talk this movie up on message boards.  The disparity in the Rotten Tomatoes scores is damning\\, and many of the positive audience reviews on that site seem very insincere in their praises.   I find the thought of your company manipulating critics in order to trick people into liking terrible movies offensive\\, and while I'm now wary of paying to see Disney films because of this suspicion\\, I will fully boycott your company if it is publicly revealed to be true.  I would join in any class action lawsuit against you that arose from that\\, as I feel I would not have seen this movie when I did if it hadn't been for all the positive press it was getting.  Not to mention\\, the attempted damage control that showed up in the media was jaw-droppingly out-of-touch and insulting.  I am not a bot\\, I am not a racist or sexist person\\, and in fact didn't ever once focus on the gender or race of the characters\\, as that has no bearing on whether a not a film is good.  People resented this movie for pandering to people obsessed with identity politics\\, not the fact that it contained diversity.  I do not believe for one second that your company is not responsible for at least some of these libelous articles that are aimed at the very people you hope to have see your next movie.  Do you really think people are going to start liking something because someone else called them a bigot for not liking it?  What a shitty way to repay people who have given you money for something you obviously couldn't care less about.  If I'm wrong\\, and you had nothing to do with insulting your ticket-buying audience\\, then it would have been prudent of you to have put out a statement IMMEDIATELY denouncing such articles and at least admitting that the movie was not for everyone.  All that's happened now is that your audience is further alienated\\, and these publications have lost credibility among people who legitimately didn't like The Last Jedi.  If you look at the current Rotten Tomato audience review score\\, that seems to be the majority now.  If you did hire shills\\, you know it should be much lower\\, too.\\n\\nI wanted to let you know that I will not be going to the theater to see any more Star Wars movies put out by your corporation in the future.  The Last Jedi killed Star Wars for me\\, and I can't think of a better phrase with which to express my disappointment.  You.  Killed.  Star.  Wars.  Others are with me\\, and while we might not be enough people to make you actually care about the quality and consistency of the products you put out\\, we are enough people that you are going to see Solo and Episode IX be the two lowest grossing Star Wars movies of all time. If IX is any good\\, I will find out when it's on video\\, when I watch it for free\\, if I have a friend that even thinks it's worth purchasing.  \\n\\nThat is\\, Solo and IX will be the lowest grossing\\, if you wisely stop production on Rian Johnson's announced trilogy.  THOSE three will be the lowest grossing. Few people want to see a Rian Johnson trilogy.  He is probably the most hated man in Star Wars now\\, and I am blown away that there wasn't more done to insure that he maintained the continuity between The Force Awakens and this film\\, and with the entirety of the Star Wars franchise.  Kathleen Kennedy is now the most hated woman in Star Wars\\, too\\, and many people are blaming her poor leadership and political agenda for hurting the franchise in general\\, and for ruining this film specifically.  A lot of people are starting to feel like she betrayed George Lucas\\, too\\, and I am finding myself agreeing with that.  You'll have to fire her and make a public display of cancelling Rian Johnson's trilogy if you want the fans to have faith in Star Wars again (actually\\, now that I've written that out\\, those two things might be enough for me to see the next Star Wars in the theaters\\, if you were to follow through with them).  \\n\\nOr\\, you can keep plucking feathers from that golden goose you slaughtered with this abomination of a film.  It's your property now\\, after all\\, and I'm sure those feathers are worth... something.\\n\\nYou screwed up.  George Lucas was stabbed in the back so you could get your hands on his multi-billion dollar franchise\\, and then you made the EXACT same mistake he did with the prequels.   You assumed people would love it as long as you slapped \\\"Star Wars\\\" on it\\, so you didn't put a lot of effort into it.  You should do some research into Gary Kurtz\\, the producer of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back\\, and his contributions to those films\\, as well as the ideas he discussed with Lucas about Return of the Jedi and the direction he saw the story going.  He reeled in Lucas' sillier ideas\\, he was instrumental in making Empire Strikes Back one of the greatest movie sequels of all time\\, and I believe Lucas was wrong to cut ties with him.\\n\\nIt's pretty sad\\, I had hoped that the Disney backing would lead to higher quality films with amazing sets and effects\\, but you reached in and tore out the very heart of Star Wars while digging for gold.  I liked Rogue One\\, and saw it 4 times in the theater\\, despite feeling like it was a little lacking.  While it had some glaring flaws\\, I liked The Force Awakens\\, too.  I saw it at least 3 times in the theater\\, including opening night\\, and the very first showing the next day.  I saw The Last Jedi once and do not want to ever see it again\\, on any format\\, anywhere.  The Last Jedi is so awful as a continuation of The Force Awaken's story\\, it makes the flaws of that movie even more glaring\\, to the point that it retroactively turns THAT movie into an awful movie as well.  That is quite the feat of failure you have managed to accomplish\\, Disney.\\n\\nI really wanted to like the new trilogy\\, but now it is not enjoyable to me at all.  I'm done with Star Wars now\\, and if you knew what it meant to me as a child growing up\\, you would be absolutely stunned to hear me say that.  Shameful.\\\"\\n\\n.","true":true}
