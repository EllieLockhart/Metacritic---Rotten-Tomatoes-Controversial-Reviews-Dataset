Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some fun aspects of the movie\\, but overall\\, this is an extremely disappointing Star Wars episode. Episode 7 left room for so many possibilities\\, especially with the new and old characters\\, but TLJ didn't even bother going in depth with them. Of course this movie was supposed to take risks and create a new feel for Star Wars\\, but it made all the wrong choices. I have loved every single Star Wars movie that has been released besides this one. I hope Disney backs off with their Marvelesque humor and will allow a new director to save this trilogy.
