Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pleasantly surprising movie- it was great watching each character go on their own difficult journey\\, even when those journey's weren't exactly flattering.\\n\\nIt might not satisfy every question that's been raised on fan forums since The Force Awakens came out\\, but that wasn't the point. Coming up with backstory zingers thankfully takes a back seat to both heroes and villains growing in one way or another.\\n\\nThere were times when the pacing could have been improved maybe\\, mainly in that it feels like there are nearly 3 endings by the time it's all over. However\\, the big moments feel big\\, and everything looks great.\\n\\nIf the look of porgs in the trailer offends you\\, stay home. Otherwise it's totally worth seeing.","true":true}
