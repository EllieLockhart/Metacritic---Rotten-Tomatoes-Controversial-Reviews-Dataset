Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too much happening in this movie. There was so much going on it didn't give the movie time to really develop any of the main characters or any new ones. Action was great but it didn't feel like the movie took advantage of the massive galaxy the series has created. Good movie\\, just not as good as expected","true":true}
