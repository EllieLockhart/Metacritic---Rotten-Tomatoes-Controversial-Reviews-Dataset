Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went with my bro this morning to see this\\, we were so excited.  2.5 hours later total heart break.  What an entirely disappointing film.  Nothing made sense\\, the film felt like twelve dozen executives sat in a writing room and the editors suite (dear lord\\, the poor editor) and made Executive Decisions over each and every scene.  I am gutted for dearly departed Carrie Fisher and poor Mark Hamill.  Seriously this is the worst Star Wars film since the Jar Jar Binks ones.  Whomever is behind this version\\, SHAME ON YOU.","true":true}
