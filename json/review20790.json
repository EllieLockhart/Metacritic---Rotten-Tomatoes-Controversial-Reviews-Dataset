Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie because it's Star Wars. I was Disappointed. Plot holes everywhere. Mishandled Luke Skywalker's character and legacy. Disconnected from the first installment of the series and left you unsatisfied with previously set up plot points. The over lapping theme is that family and wise Mentors don't matter. You can master the force without training. Social and political messages invade this story and detract from the flow of the movie. The overall theme is to kill off the past why? So that Disney can make Star Wars into whatever they want even if it means polarizing die hard fans.","true":true}
