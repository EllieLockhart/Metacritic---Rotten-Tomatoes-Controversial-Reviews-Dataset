Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film. Hell! It is not even a Star Wars movie. It simply destroys all the previous films and the entire franchise. Please\\, give one star ( although it doesn't deserve it ) to make sure your rating is valid. The Rotten Tomatoes doesn't count 1\/2 and not interested scores","true":true}
