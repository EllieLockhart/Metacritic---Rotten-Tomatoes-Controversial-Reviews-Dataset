Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will say there are a lot of quirky decisions with the story... but overall it's a really\\, really well made film in it's own right.  It's tense\\, it's fun\\, it's got twists\\, it's exciting\\, and it makes you think about the Philosophy of the Force.  Overall it's awesome.  I have questions with why Luke acts certain ways to solve certain problems... or how certain characters find ways to save themselves in crazy situations\\, but it's amazing and I really loved it walking out of the theater :)","true":true}
