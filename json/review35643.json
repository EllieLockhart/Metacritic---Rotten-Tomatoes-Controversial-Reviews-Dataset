Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an Amazing addition to the Star Wars Saga\\, and amazing seques to The Force Awakens and a great heartfelt action packed movie! It has fun moments that at times feel like they're too much\\, but in the end all is balanced! The action always adds and serves the story even if some secondary plots are not the most exciting! The drama feels real and the revelations are\\, to me\\, extremely satisfying even if unexpected. If in the end of TFA the place of each character was undefined\\, now all of them are in place to the amazing conclusion of this trilogy!","true":true}
