Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The color scheme was gorgeous. A few good set pieces. But overall I should have walked out and demanded my money back. Combine 5-6 into something unsatisfactory and that is The Last Jedi. Save for a free code with Redbox.","true":true}
