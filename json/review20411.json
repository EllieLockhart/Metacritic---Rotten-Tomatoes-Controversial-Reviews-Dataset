Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why many fans feel the way they do about this movie but I think their expectations got in the way of what they saw.  Is it a perfect movie no but it's really good in many parts. There are only a couple of things I didn't like about the movie.","true":true}
