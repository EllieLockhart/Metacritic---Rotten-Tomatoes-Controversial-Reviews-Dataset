Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film I have ever seen in my life. Why was this movie even made? Everything about it defied logic. Princess Leia flying in space like a space fairy was the stupidest thing I ever seen on film. Who is Rey? No one! Who is Snoke? No one! Why is Kylo Ren mad? For no reason! I mean really? Did anyone else not see what I saw? Just thinking back on this movie makes me mad. No other movie has ever pissed me off after leaving the theater as much as this one!!","true":true}
