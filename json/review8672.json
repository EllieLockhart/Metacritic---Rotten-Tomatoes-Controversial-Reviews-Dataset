Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"F@!k this movie\\, Luke deserves better. Disney\\, please learn from this that yes you need an artist with a vision at the heal\\, just make sure that person can maintain continuity and tell a good story. Good visuals and an establish IP does not a good film make; risks need be taken to make something new and worth watching\\, but don't put that job in the hands of people who don't know what there doing\\, ignore continuity and are blinded by ideologies \/ agendas (F@!k Kathleen Kennedy\\, the force is not female\\, as much as it's not male; it's for everyone).","true":true}
