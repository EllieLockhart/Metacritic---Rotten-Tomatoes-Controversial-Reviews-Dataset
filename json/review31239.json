Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many problems. The plot was disjointed with terrible pacing and pointless subplots. The characters were flat and unrelatable. All the emotion was pulled out by cheap jokes at inappropriate times. Without spoilers all I can say is that all the characters were undermined in some way\\, especially Luke and Snoke (they're both pointless to the movie). The dialogue was mostly exposition and completely unnatural. \\n\\nAll in all it was a huge disappointment. Besides from a couple action scenes (which also had problems) it wasn't even enjoyable. A very\\, very disappointing entry to Star Wars. The official critics are lying off their butts to give this movie positive reviews.","true":true}
