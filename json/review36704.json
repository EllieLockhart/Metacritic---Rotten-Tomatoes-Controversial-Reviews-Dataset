Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is very good. Anyone disappointed with this movie is just upset because it didn\u2019t meet their expectations of how Rey\u2019s story should have gone\\, how the force works\\, etc. In other words\\, because they have been a long time fan\\, they think they own the franchise. God forbid someone do something bold and different. The same fans who hated on The Force Awakens for being too similar to a new hope are now hating on The Last Jedi because it\u2019s different from any other Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
