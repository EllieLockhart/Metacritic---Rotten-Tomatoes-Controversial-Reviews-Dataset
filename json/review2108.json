Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A structural mess with unnecessary puns galore. there is still some enjoyment to be had but this is one of the weaker entries of the franchise. As a diehard Fan of Star Wars who has spent his life time reading\\, watching and playing through the expanded universe\\, I can only recommend The Last Jedi for franchise completists.","true":true}
