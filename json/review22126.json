Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killing off the best characters not a good idea. This movie could have gone in such a fun\\, creative and positive direction without having to kill of Han and Luke. I could of made a better Star Wars than these last 2 drunk. ","true":true}
