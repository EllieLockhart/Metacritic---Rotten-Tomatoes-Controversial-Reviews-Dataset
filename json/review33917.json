Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. SJWs at Disney have taken over and destroyed Star Wars as any true fan knew and appreciated it. Also\\, SJW stuff aside\\, no plot and and any points of interest\/suspense just get completely demolished. What a waste.","true":true}
