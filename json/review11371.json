Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Disappointing. And worst\\, boring. If Mel Brooks had more money and interest in CGI\\, \u2018Spaceballs\u2019 might have looked like this. But \u2018Spaceballs\u2019 was intended to be a comedy. This movie was trying too hard to be a Marvel movie. Crammed full of lousy dad jokes. Pointless side trips that accomplished nothing but wasting hours of my time. A lot of action occurred on screen\\, but there was almost zero chemistry between the people. And there was no character development\\, so you just didn\u2019t care what happened to them anyways. The villain they\u2019ve been talking up was Gollum after his swim in Mt. Doom and shockingly weak. Wonder how many film critics will be taking free trips to Disney World this summer? That\u2019s the only way I can explain their overwhelmingly positive response to this snoozefest. It was overprocessed\\, commercialized crap. ","true":true}
