Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing movie. They made so many stupid decisions with the characters and there were at least 3 seasons when in my head I yelled: \u201cWTF is happening?! What am I watching!?\u201d The decisions made were soooo weird. I can\u2019t recommend this movie. It was meh at best","true":true}
