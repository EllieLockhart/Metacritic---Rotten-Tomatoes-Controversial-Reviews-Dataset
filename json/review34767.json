{"101487":173905,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The direction and writing of the movie leaves a major dent in Star Wars mythology. It completely renders the Skywalker saga useless. The movie has not one scene with serious dialogue. Major characters wasted along the plot with limited character development. Story takes away so much from what Abrams worked so hard to build. Now JJ has the fate of Star Wars (if not already gone) on his hands. I can't believe Disney awarded Johnson is own trilogy. This movie gives me zero inclination to watch his trilogy. And DISNEY stop posting fake user reviews!!!!! The last Jedi is so far out of touch with other entries that it's unbearable. I am truly heartbroken","true":true}
