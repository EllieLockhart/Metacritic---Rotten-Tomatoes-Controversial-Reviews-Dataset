Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi strips away all meaning from Star Wars and replaces it with nothing - it is an exercise in nihilism. Such a disappointment and wasted opportunity. This was no way to honor Carrie Fisher or the fans. I wish I could unsee this film.","true":true}
