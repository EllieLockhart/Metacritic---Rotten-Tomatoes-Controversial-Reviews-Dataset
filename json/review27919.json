Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE 1\/2 STAR REVIEWS.\\nApparently Rotten Tomatoes isn't counting the half star reviews for The Last Jedi (Disney probably had something to do with this).\\nThis is very misleading\\, the score should actually be way lower otherwise.\\n\\nF*ck you Kathleen Kennedy and Rian for completely ruining star wars","true":true}
