Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We don't hate the people behind the characters\\, we hate the characters. The characters of the sequel trilogy are so incredibly bad. They have just about no arc\\, a lot of them are just here to fill a diversity quota\\, which would be fine; if the characters were meaningful to the story. I don't dislike Rey because she's a female\\, I dislike Rey because the universe up and gives her everything. From flying skills\\, fighting skills\\, force skills (even though she thought it was a myth in TFA)\\, everyone loves her\\, everyone who doesn't love her is evil\\, everyone trusts her\\, everyone who doesn't trust her is evil... you get the point. These are all Mary Sue characteristics\\, this is the opposite of what we want in science fiction; we want failure\\, we want training. No one picks up a blaster for the first time and hits every shot (although she does not\\, it's an example)\\, no one who has never been on the ship the Millennium Falcon can pilot it and fix it better than its owner\\, no one hits 3 TIE fighters in their first shot ever in the gunship of the Millennium Falcon\\, no one can use the force to the potential she does without training\\, no one should be able to beat a fully trained dark side lightsaber duelist with no training\\, there's too many flaws in here character to list. Don't even get me started on Rose and Phasma\\, don't get me started on why no one has ever used light speed as a weapon before Holdo\\, don't get me started on why there were hundreds of storm troopers in one shot and in the next they're all on the other side of the room\\, don't get me started on why light sabers only cause flesh wounds\\, and please don't get me started on Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy and their love for shoving their agendas and opinions down our throat in a universe we loved\\, leave that to movies that don't have an already existing canon. The force is not female\\, the force is not male\\, the force is an energy field that runs through and binds all living things\\, it did not discriminate until you started to tell us this \\\"The Force is Female\\\" stuff\\, you are the cause of this \\\"discrimination\\\". Disney\\, all we wanted was for you to not ruin the characters we loved... what did you do? Made Luke a coward\\, space-cow-milk-drinking idiot\\, he went from seeing the light in Vader after he murdered hundreds Younglings and other Jedi to seeing the dark in his OWN NEPHEW AND THOUGHT TO KILL HIM IN HIS SLEEP why\\, Disney\\, why did you think this would be what anyone thought Luke would do? You're damn right you subverted our expectations\\, not in a good way. I'm not going to write any more about this\\, there's so many video essays on it\\, I urge you to watch them yourself.","true":true}
