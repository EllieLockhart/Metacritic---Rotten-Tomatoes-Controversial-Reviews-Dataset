Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Funny most of the positive reviews are one liners\\, many of the negative reviews contain valid arguments for why this was bad. Disney forgets us old fans (with Kids) need the parents to pay for this. After this epic waste of a film they will get $0 product from our household. BTW my frustration has nothing to do with the \\\"new\\\" direction or the social theme they threw in - the plot was terrible - Period end of discussion.","true":true}
