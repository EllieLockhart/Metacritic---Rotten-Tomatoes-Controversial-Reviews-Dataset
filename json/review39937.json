{"101487":182062,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-14","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily the best StarWars movie yet. Mark Hamil\\, Daisy Ridley\\, John boyaega(probably spelled wrong)\\, Adam Driver and all the other main actors were really good. You feel for these characters when they are put in danger you dont know if they are gonna die. \\nSPOILERS!!!\\n\\n\\nI liked the fact that snoke died\\, it felt like they got rid of him to make the new trilogy feel like something new and not just a recap of the original trilogy. I like the fact that luke did not die since that would just be wasting his character i think hes gonna make a sacrifice in the last movie so that Rey can turn\/take down Kylo Ren. \\n\\n\\n\\nSPOILERS END!\\nOverall a great movie that brings something new to the fantastic table that is StarWars","true":true}
