Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This \\\"thing\\\" broke the sequel triology for me. Good thing I can aways count on the OT and the prequels. This movie has no proper charater development (in some cases they devolve\\, like in Finn's case)\\, it breaks the   established lore (the lighspeed crash\/air and gravity in open space)\\, and is an overall mess. Hope this debacle subverted Disney expectations for the franchise.","true":true}
