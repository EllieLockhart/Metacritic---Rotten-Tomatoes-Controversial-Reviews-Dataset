{"101487":105061,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-11","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge fan of the Star Wars trilogies growing up\\, I have been very excited to see how this third trilogy plays out. To be honest\\, I wasn't the biggest fan of The Force Awakens\\, although I did believe it was a step up from the Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. The Last Jedi\\, however\\, I thought was much better than The Force Awakens. There was a lot of character development that we never got to see in the Force Awakens\\, and the plot was much more original and very intriguing. And\\, of course\\, Luke returned. That has to earn a star just by itself. The only thing holding me back from providing a higher rating is one small thing that just bothered me and I doubt will be explained\\, and another that I really hope is gone more into depth in the next movie(Although I have a feeling it won't be). First\\, the beginning of the movie when Leia uses the force to save herself from the explosion that occurred on her ship. Although I understand the logic behind it\\, given the connection the Skywalker family has to the force\\, the fact that they never so much as mentioned it was rather annoying. The other thing\\, which I feel is much more important\\, is Snoke. How he got there or who he is never comes up in any way in either of the films. I was expecting this movie to go more into who he was\\, how he met Ben\\, but instead they just slap in a line from Luke mentioning that they met. No backstory was provided\\, and given that he is dead now\\, I doubt any will ever be provided.","true":true}
