Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a lot of bad stuff\\, but it has a lot of good stuff as well.Although I like this movie I'm gonna have to admit that it is flawed.Captain Phasma was wasted potential.I don't like that they made General Hux a joke.I hate the casino planet subplot with Finn and Rose.Poe is kind of dumb in this movie.I like Kylo Ren and Rey in this movie.This movie definitely shut down the whole \\\"Marey Sue\\\"argument.Luke Skywalker is definitely the best part of the movie.I love his character arc about him rejecting his \\\"status\\\" as a legend.The cinematography is probably the best in the saga.This movie has equal good and bad which is why this movie is so dividing.For anyone who doesn't like the movie I think you should watch it again with an open mind.","true":true}
