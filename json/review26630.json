Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, this was no Rogue One. Anyone who's read my review on R1\\, or saw my Youtube rant on it knows that's actually a GOOD thing. Or is it? This movie wasn't\\, as I said\\, the Disaster that R1 was\\, so i actually liked it. I also HATED it. And therein lies the rub; it's not even bad enough to make me passionate in my hatred of it\\, nor is it good enough to make me excited and joyous to see it again. It just...is. \\n\\nI think the writers and director misunderstood Yoda when he advised Luke in Empire Strikes Back \\\"Do\\, or do not. There is no try\\,\\\" because it sure as hell looks like they put together a movie that does...and does not...all in one shitty little package. There were pros and there were cons. And in the end\\, this is a movie that I can't really hate for that...I just can't care about it much either. Like my rating indicates\\, this is a straight down-the-line middling Star Wars movie. In other words\\, these are not the droids you're looking for.","true":true}
