Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BAD comedy ruins what should be dramatic moments. Characters make choices that don't exactly mesh with what has been established in the past. All the mysteries set up in Force Awakens are either abandoned or given unsatisfactory answers.very disappointing.","true":true}
