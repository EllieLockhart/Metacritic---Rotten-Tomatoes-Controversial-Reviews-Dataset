Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had very high hopes and actually believed in the hype around Johnson before I saw this. I'm disappointed. The OT had a deep and thoughtful plot woven through some sweet moments that made me genuinely care about the characters. This film was a heap of different moments thrown together which give us just enough of a look at each character to end up being annoying. I just don't care about the new characters. Their journey means nothing to me because they have no breadth\\, height\\, nor depth. They just run around a lot doing things that are supposed to be in line with whatever their role is supposed to be. I'm just so tired of the whole ADHD approach to making movies. Avengers\\, Transformers\\, Fast and Furious\\, and now Star Wars? It's a big bag of meaningless action appealing only to people who haven't lived enough to appreciate the value of pacing a story. Had another ticket to see it today that I won't be using now\\, in case anyone wants it.","true":true}
