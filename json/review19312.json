Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s not the Empire Strikes Back\\, but it definitely doesn\u2019t deserve a \u201crotten\u201d rating. I left the theater happy and I will pay to see it again. It\u2019s slow at times\\, but there is enough of the classic\\, amazing space opera stuff that I love about Star Wars for me to call it a solid film.","true":true}
