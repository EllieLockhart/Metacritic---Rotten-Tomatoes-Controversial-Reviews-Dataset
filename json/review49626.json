Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, they just killed Star wars.\\n\\nEpisode 1-3 were bad movies\\, but it was still Star Wars\\, just badly directed\\, too corny and childish. SW The Last Jedi didn't feel like Star wars\\, the story was all over the place\\,  and they make a concerted effort to advance SJW agenda. At times you didn't know if you were watching a comedy. I'll give it two stars because the production value of the movie was good\\, all the effects and stuff\\, and you could say it was entertaining\\, but as a Star Wars movie it sucked. I had some complains about the Force Awakens\\, but I still liked it. This one\\, I don't think I'll ever watch it again.","true":true}
