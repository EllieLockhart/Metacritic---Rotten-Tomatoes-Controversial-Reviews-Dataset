Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not a perfect film\\, and not the best in the Saga. The Last Jedi was a brilliantly executed\\, fun\\, surprising and thoroughly entertaining film.  I personally didn't feel the run-time while watching it\\, and like most others criticisms against the film\\, the Finn\/Rose storyline did bog down the middle of the film and feel a little out of place.  While Rose is a nice addition and very well acted\\, you can tell she enjoyed her time filming throughout\\, you almost wish they had stronger material and a more worthwhile subplot which kept you more engaged instead of wishing you'd get back to Luke and Rey on the island.\\nMark Hamill nails this portrayal of a jaded\\, and frightened Luke Skywalker. Utterly mesmerizing\\, and you can see how far his character has come from the frustrated dreamer of A New Hope.\\nCarrie FIsher also shines and what a fitting way for her to end (albeit unexpectedly at the time) from the franchise and her tribute in the credits brought a round of applause from those I saw the film with.\\nUtterly brilliant and a worthy entry in the saga.  Can't wait for Episode IX.","true":true}
