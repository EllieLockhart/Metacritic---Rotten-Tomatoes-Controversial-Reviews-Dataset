Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like the last two Star Wars movies\\, The Last Jedi was a disappointment.  It's the same plot line over and over again. I won't write anymore because I think there are many who haven't seen it\\, yet.  But\\, yeah...kind of boring.","true":true}
