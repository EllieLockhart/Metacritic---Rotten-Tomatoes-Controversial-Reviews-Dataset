The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This for me was an 8\/10 (+2 because i hate to see the ratings so low) If you disagree with me I understand but at least hear what I have to say\r\rSpoiler Free section:\r\\n\r\\nRegardless of this game not being what fans wanted\\, It's unfair to call is a bad game.

Naughty DogThis for me was an 8\/10 (+2 because i hate to see the ratings so low) If you disagree with me I understand but at least hear what I have to say\r\rSpoiler Free section:\r\rRegardless of this game not being what fans wanted\\, It's unfair to call is a bad game. It's a strong story with complex characters and despite how depressing the game is\\, it doesn't make it a bad game. Naughty Dog focused on making a great game\\, not a good game. Great and good are not interchangeable. Bad people like Hitler and Stalin can be considered Great\\, but in no way are they good\\, in fact they are terrible. That's how this game hits\\, as a game that is very selective in who likes it\\, but overall is a great game in general.\r\rSpoilers:\r\rOne of the biggest problems with this games ending is that people can't really understand it well\\, which is understandable but before writing a negative review because your favorite character died and you didn't like the ending\\, maybe try to dissect it\\, ask why\\, and look for hope in the end because there definitely is some that many people missed.\r\rStarting from the beginning\\, Joel sings to Ellie with an emphasis on the phrase\\, \\\"If I ever were to lose you\\, I'd surely lose myself. Unfortunately this happens to Ellie and this whole story is about how she loses herself to try to avenge Joel's death. There is a scene right after Ellie tortured Nora when she is crying partly because of what she has done but then she tells Dina\\, \\\"I don't want to lose you.\\\" This is the moment that Ellie realizes that losing Dina is a real possibility if her revenge continues.\r\rMoving forward to the end of the game\\, Ellie tracts down Abby and has her drowning underwater. Instead of ending her life\\, she pictures Joel playing the guitar and stops (Important for later). At this point we don't know why she lets Abby live and we get even more angry at the game. Then they show that Dina and her baby left Ellie and that Ellie really did lose everything in fact\\, she can't even play the guitar anymore.\r\rFinally\\, we know that Ellie let Abby go\\, not for Abby and Levi sake\\, but for the sake of herself. If she really went through and ended Abby's life she realizes it would no make a difference\\, but more importantly\\, Ellie would 'surely lose herself'. Showing the scene where Ellie wants to forgive Joel is moment when Ellie spared Abby and this is because Ellie wanted didn't want to give in the the violence and completely become what Joel had become\\, what she couldn't forgive because then how could she expect Dina to understand. This is Ellie last grasp on her once sassy sarcastic 14 year old self and she is able to stop herself. the game ends with Ellie leaving the farm and (probably) going to look for Dina and JJ now that she has a small piece of herself to give\\, she hopes that Dina might someday forgive her like she decided to to with Joel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
