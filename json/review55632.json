Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the best Star Wars film but far from being the worst. Gave a good new angle to the universe for a new generation. Not the usual fun and lovable type of Star Wars film like the original trilogy. But instead\\, for long term fans was incredibly interesting. My only faults would be badly timed and badly written attempts of comedy that dropped. As well as the insight of a new angle for Star Wars turning into the same old Jedi good guys forever story that most of the characters had spoken out against throughout the film. Therefore went back on it's new ideas. Overall I wasn't as dazzled with this film as much as I was the last. But I very much enjoyed it and I will be watching it again","true":true}
