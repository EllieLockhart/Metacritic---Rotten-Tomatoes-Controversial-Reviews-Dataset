{"101487":116735,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"D\\n(62.5\/100)\\n\\nI was torn by the risks taken by Rian Johnson and LucasFilm\\, and it actually made a difference in my opinion on this franchise going forward.  After reading many negative reactions and thinking\\, \\\"What about this film is pissing off so many fans of Star Wars?\\\"\\, I've become hesitant in my assessment for the film.  So this is my honest opinion\\, after yet another Star Wars high.  This review contains spoilers.\\n\\nSTORY:  In comparison to Episode VII\\, and as part of a whole series\\, the story of The Last Jedi isn't COMPLETELY an Empire rip-off.  But it really kinda goes nowhere.  The good stuff was with Luke\\, Kylo\\, Snoke\\, Yoda\\, and that's it.  It's also has a lot of cliched story points.  1\/4\\n\\nSCRIPT:  The movie opens somewhat dull\\, like The Phantom Menace\\, then gets right into a long action sequence that goes on a little *too* long; Luke's dialogue was pretty good; Kylo had some neat conflict story going on\\, but the script never explains its most WTF moments.  I thought the humor got in the way at times throughout the film\\, especially in the opening and with Poe and Hux.  That was kind of annoying  And they forgot to include\\, \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\"! I felt that the other characters besides Rey\\, Luke\\, and Ben just kinda populate the script to have subplots that fill up time when really what we want to see is Rey\\, Luke\\, and Ben.  Indeed\\, the editing does a decent job balancing those subplots\\, and the scene in the throne room narrows down the focus and gets right to the point with this trilogy: it's about Rey and Ben.  But that's all at the climax; The Last Jedi is bogged with a Poe-Vs.-Leadership subplot\\, Finn-and-Rose-are-heroes-and-fall-in-love subplot\\, Leia's superpowers which are never really addressed again\\, and stuff that just doesn't need to be so prevalent in this movie.  It serves to better develop characters we don't really care about to begin with\\, and yes at the expense of a 152 minute runtime; I appreciate that that Johnson at least wrote this movie around individuals and not just Star Wars-y stuff; it shows he cared enough to try to develop some of the characters\\, but it could have been better than this.  And just... a lot of stupid stuff happens in this movie.  2\/4\\n\\nCHARACTERS:  Rian Johnson's task was to continue the story of these new characters\\, and he did his best to put them in positions where each can grow.  And some of them do\\, namely Rey\\, Ben\\, and Luke.  The others have some personality and they all have arcs of some kind -- but they just aren't as memorable as the main three\\, or the characters in the original trilogy.  Rey is the weakest of all of them\\, though.  She's not interesting\\, has no backstory\\, and no motivation.  And she's the star?  Honestly there are just too many characters in this movie\\, and the previous episode.  They should have just kept it simple from the very beginning:  Rey vs. Kylo\\, Luke trains her\\, Kylo is also trained by Luke . . . that's what we wanted to see in this new trilogy.  Not Porgs.  Also\\, what they did with Snoke was completely out of left field and undercuts the Force Awakens--making it even more meaningless than it already is.  I understand Snoke's end is to narrow the focus of the trilogy\\, but now his presence in the first movie is barely necessary when you know he's not the big baddie you were hoping for.  So\\, why not just have Hux be the Supreme Leader and\/or Kylo Ren's master from the get-go or something?  He's a more realistic character than Snoke or the Emperor\\, and that would be kind of different for this trilogy: two young Sith lords with a Last Jedi to kill.  But instead Hux is still around...and it's weird because he adds nothing to the film.  Wow\\, what a memorable\\, memorable character.  Anyway\\, Finn didn't really grow so much; Poe does but his story is like a completely different movie; Leia grows into her own in The Last Jedi\\, filling in the wise sage role that Luke does\\, but in a kinder light that also worked okay.  Luke's characterization was excellent both as an addition to the main character's journey and as a continuation of his own; really satisfying ending with him\\, with a great shot of the twin suns.  Ben's character direction really surprised me; Part of me wishes Rey had turned!!!  What a setup that would be.  But no\\, they had to make it clear that women are smart and don't turn to the dark side because they are not evil and are resilient to mansplaing powers and are better than men in every way womenwomenwomenwomen.  2\/4\\n\\nDIRECTION:  Johnson's craft is\\, at the very least\\, pretty good here given his style and the material.  It's stylistically different from the rest of the series\\, and contains some very visually interesting scenes I never thought we'd see in a Star Wars movie.  He also got pretty good performances out of Adam Driver and Carrie Fisher (some of her best work here too; R.I.P.).  But he doesn't understand Star Wars whatsoever\\, the jokes are ridiculously out of line\\, and the opening crawl has never been so pointless in a Star Wars movie.  He also added porgs to the script WHILE HE WAS MAKING THE MOVIE.  Really?  That was your priority?  Porgs...and pissing off fans?  Where was his focus exactly?  2\/4\\n\\nPERFORMANCES:  Mark Hamill was good in this movie.  I wonder if he'll get nominated?  Carrie Fisher\\, Adam Driver\\, and Daisy Ridley were all very good in the film acting-wise; Boyega was more restrained but so was his character\\, being on Canto Bight so fart apart from the rest of the action.  \\nNewcomers Kelly Mary Tran\\, Laura Dern\\, and Benicio Del Toro all delivered fine performances for their respective underdeveloped characters.  3\/4\\n\\nCINEMATOGRAPHY:  Some of the best cinematography in Star Wars.  The shots\\, the angles\\, the movements\\, all very good and stylistically unique to the franchise without straying too far into unusual territory.  But it almost always goes out of its way to shove someone in your face who isn't a white male to show that they \\\"care\\\" about diversity and representation.  Also\\, one zoom on Luke's face when he's in a cave talking about something\\, looked shaky and weird.  It still bugs me.  I think about it everyday.  3\/4\\n\\nEDITING:  It's definitely too long\\, and some plot points should have been shortened.  They kept cutting away from Luke and Rey and that was the most interesting stuff.  The editing did do a good job of tightening a few emotional and important moments\\, but also just forgets about the story being told that we came to see.  2\/4\\n\\nMUSIC:  I liked this score a lot better than Williams' last outing\\, which underwhelmed me.  This one felt more like the original trilogy\\, but it also blending old and new themes.  Though not as memorable as the rest of films\\, it was more unique than the Force Awakens. 3\/4\\n\\nSOUND DESIGN:  Stat Wars pretty much invented sound design\\, so it's no surprise here that the sound transports you into a galaxy far\\, far away.  4\/4\\n\\nACTION \/ SPECIAL EFFECTS:  Can't argue there; it's excellent!  Rian Johnson knows how to helm action\\, he used a lot of practical effects\\, the CGI was pretty good.  The action scenes were good but a bit long\\, and you don't always feel invested in it because the characters and their goals are not always that interesting.  3\/4\\n\\nTotal points:\\n25\/40\\n62.5\/100\\nD\\n-_-\\nOverall\\, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is not the best in the series.  It may very well be one of the worst\\,  I think.  Look\\, clearly these movies are not for the fans.  If the fans could maybe accept that and ignore them\\, it would be better that way; that's what I'm going to do.","true":true}
