Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"took me a day to decide if I liked it. But I love what they did\\, it really makes this trilogy feel like it's own trilogy and not just playing on the old trilogy's nastolgia. although there's plenty of that to go around.","true":true}
