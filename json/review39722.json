Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great example of how not to do a second act in a trilogy. It is also a cautionary tale against capriciously attempting to subvert audience expectations. I would rather that the director\/writer would have subverted audience expectations by making the plot a rom-com than by having taken the route he took with this comedy of errors: it subverted my expectations by not being in the spirit of Star Wars\\, and that is not a commendable accomplishment. No movie has ever drawn my ire to the degree that this dumpster fire did.","true":true}
