Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Production and set design to include overall look was okay.  No longer has that Star Wars \\\"feel\\\" to it.  However\\, the story and direction was disappointing.  As if the writer\/director thought it would be fun to make a Star Wars movie...with crystal furry animals\\, and flying space princesses.  This Star Wars adaptation could and should have been so much more.  Johnson failed to keep the force alive.","true":true}
