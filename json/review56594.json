Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is by no means the worst film ever made like a lot of fans are making it out to be. I thought Mark Hammill and Carrie Fisher put on stellar performances\\, the island scenes were top-notch\\, and the space and land battles were phenomenal. However\\, the movie is deeply hurt by some crippling flaws. I could go on about how there's too much CGI\\, some clunky dialogue\\, and a good 30-45 minutes of screentime that could've been cut\\, but the biggest issue with this film is the lack of backstory to accompany Snoke and The First Order. Without proper context as to how Snoke\\, Kylo\\, and the First Order came out of nowhere in 30 years\\, it seems like we're just watching a fan fiction follow-up film that is slaughtering all the characters we cared about in the OT. With The Force Awakens\\, J.J. Abrhams did a successful job of relaunching the Star Wars franchise and setting up several plot mysteries such as Snoke's origin\\, Rey's parents\\, and the mystery behind the First Order. With The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson has chosen to flat-out ignore explaining the burning questions fans had from Episode 7 and it feels like a slap to the face. Episode 9 is going to have a lot of its work cut out as it has A LOT of backstory and mystery to iron out and explain to Star Wars fans. We demand answers and drastically better writing.","true":true}
