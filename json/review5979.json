Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. The movie was in a rush to destroy everything we knew from the original series\\, and has no respect for the events that came before it. Forced humor\\, poor dialogue\\, and a plot that only functions because Admiral Holdo refuses to speak with her officers about a plan they need to be aware of.","true":true}
