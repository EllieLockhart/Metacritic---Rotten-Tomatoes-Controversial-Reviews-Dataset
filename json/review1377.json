{"101487":104904,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big Star Wars fan I was extremely disappointed in The Last Jedi. \\n\\nI've seen it twice now\\, going to see it again today and then a fourth time on the 20th. I bought all these tickets before I saw it\\, to take friends and family to see the film\\, and so far none of them have liked it. That's all ages and varing levels of fans.\\n\\nThere are many layers of issues with the movie. First issue\\, dialog. Rey's early interactions with Luke had me stunned! Not what she said but was she actually just robotically telling Luke to come back because Kylo has no more light in him?? My first thought was\\, \\\"I can't believe someone wrote this and it made it to the film...\\\" (I'm not saying Daisy didn't do well\\, I'm saying that the line they gave her was awful)\\n\\nI'm a fan who loves theories\\, I think reading and interacting with others pulls you into the universe and it can feel awesome and rewarding. There's been no shortage of books\\, comics\\, and video games to hype fan discussion!! Which has been so so fun. So when the answer to THE hugest question as set out by the first film \\\"who are Rey's parents?\\\" to have the answer be \\\"no one of consequence.\\\" Leaves a very awful taste in the mouth. \\n\\nWhy did I just spend time and money\\, reading and playing if the answer was \\\"don't look for answers.\\\" I guess the lesson Disney is trying to teach me is that it's pointless to put in depth thought into this saga anymore. Which makes me very sad.\\n\\nI've read the defense for Rey's parents being nobody's\\, that it shows that you don't have to come from before or you don't have to come from some special bloodline. My counter to that is... we didn't need to be reminded of that!!! Ever watch Rebels?! Ezra doesn't come from some great past and he is a Jedi. The prequels have thousands of Jedi of all different races and we assume they didn't all have amazing special parents. \\n\\nWhat hurts about this \\\"reveal\/non reveal\\\" is that Disney brought that question up\\, and on company accounts online has kept stoking that question and debate among fans... who's Rey's parents?\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to say is\\, if they weren't going to be someone who we knew from the earlier saga\\, don't lead us down the path let's us talk about it for years when you know the answer is going to be \\\"nothing.\\\"\\n\\nIf Rey had never said \\\"me too\\, big secret. I'm waiting for my family.\\\" Or Maz \\\"who's the girl.\\\" We would have all just assumed she was just a girl strong with the force and been happy to go about the story. \\n\\nWhen you build it up a question and then the answer is nothing\\, I don't call that artistically interesting I think that's a cheap trick to play on faithful fans. \\n\\nDisney please just one thing\\, don't bring things up if they aren't going to be answered or not be significant. You've tweeted about Obi-wans light saber\\, please stop doing those type of things if they have no significance to this saga. \\n\\nThe movie was long\\, but didn't feel long. I love starwars and the characters so much I'll watch them say lines that land funny. Seeing any version of Luke was awesome\\, the world is sad enough already\\, do we have to see our old heroes fall? I guess the answer is yes. \\n\\nThe battle of Crait was very pretty\\, the opening scene with Poe taking on the first order was one of the best things in the movie! the humor was oddly delivered at times. The force awakens nailed the amount and tone and timing of humor in Star Wars. \\n\\nKylo Ren is the one thing that everyone likes about the movie. Proud moment when my sister walked out saying \\\"I'm totally in on Rey and Kylo.\\\" Easily the best part of the movie was Driver's Kylo Ren.\\n\\nThe more times I watch the more I'm able to just find the acceptance that the magic I loved no longer is wanted in these current and future films.","true":true}
