Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"just really disappointed in the missed opportunities and the lack of feel that this is a star wars movie. one leave your political masquerades for your conference's or your tweets. when im going to see a star wars movie I don't want to see your views I don't care even if they align with mine. but no force possibly the worst story line I may have ever had to watch in a movie happen and at the end of it get campy explanation of how saveing a few animals is worth damming the entire galaxy. I literally yelled BS in the theater. and that is not even half of what is wrongnot even a 1\/4. this movie was terrible even as a movie that is not a part of a trilogy. rian Johnson I think you are a ok director. but it doesn't make you cool that you not only shit on J.J. but also shit on the fans. we don't need you follow what we \\\"want\\\" but there was a reason that NO ONE could have guessed what you were going to do. IT'S BECUASE WHAT YOU DID FUCKING SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
