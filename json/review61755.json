There's plot holes everywhere. The first plot hole comes from abby getting pinned down by zombies between a fence and a wall being they are zombies any chance to grab her they would have taken yet none of the zombies really grabbed for her.2 Tommy taking stupid pills and giving up their names like he doesn't know people could be after joel for killing all those fireflies that probably had families.3 I can't actually say how many contrived plot armor points there are for abby.We could have just waited to kill joel in till half way through the story and that would've been better. They could've had abby and ellie work together for a little bit and make the character more likeable. But no the choose to kill off joel a fan favorite by the hands of a brand new character. The way she did it made me not want to play the rest of the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
