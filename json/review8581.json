Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all.. sorry\\, I'm not some fancy writer.. Just a die hard Star Wars fan that is extremely puzzled by a lot of the reviews I'm reading.\\n\\nThe writing for this movie is trash\\n1. Confirmed! Rey is a Mary Sue after all (Lets hope it was a lie to get her to join Kylo)\\n2. Snoke and Phasma both killed off with out ever having had any character development what so ever!!! Snoke.. the most mysterious an possibly interesting character in this trilogy tossed aside like Luke did with the Skywalker lightsaber. \\n3. Leia getting sucked into space and then doing a Captain Morgan back to the ship where Poe opens the door \\\"TO SPACE\\\" and there's no vacuum????\\n4. The whole Finn & Rose mission was a complete waste of time and film. Canto Bight sucked and this was alot of time they could have used to explore snokes story or the knights of ren or something...\\n5. Hux was just there to be the butt of peoples jokes.. Hux should be more like Tarkin! Maybe it's just me but the whole First Order thing doesnt even seem scary cuz its just Kylo throwing tantrums and Hux being disrespected.\\n\\nThere's so much more.. uhg dont get me started on how bad of a job they did with Luke... but I'm just gonna stop here.\\n\\nI have only seen it once and will probably go again to see if anything changes for me. But I went to see the force awakens 7 times.. I wont be doing that with this one.. so disappointed.","true":true}
