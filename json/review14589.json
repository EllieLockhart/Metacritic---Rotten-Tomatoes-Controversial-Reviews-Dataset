Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a starwars fan for a long time (more than 3 decades). Last Jedi distroyed my childhood dream. Just made me uninstall all my starwars apps. Either you like it or hate it. I am not even going to purchase any starwars merchandise in future. Hope Disney \/ Lucas film will apologise to the Starwars fans  and rectify the mistakes they did. Starwars is Starwars and that why normal critics were so wrong with their review. They don't  understand that this franchise lasted so long so strong because of fans","true":true}
