Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great ! I'm not just saying it as a fan of the weird since I was seven with the empires strike back but also due to I like the new characters driving the lore and story in new directions . The writer brought new twists and new storylines into the story while having a concrete plot . I also like the new planets and scenarios the characters are put in . The new heroes are backed by old time favorites and at the same time the new characters hold your interest for two and a half hours . In fact I didn't even notice how much time had past and didn't ben use the bathroom once .","true":true}
