Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't know why it has such a low audience score until I saw it..  Feel like they rushed and made different story line than what seems like original star wars series..  My coworkers said it's kid's movie now.. I guess so.. disappointed..","true":true}
