Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! When I first left the movie\\, I was in shock. It took me a good day or 2 to process everything that I had seen in that movie. To say this movie pushes the limits of the Star Wars universe is an understatement. I don't want to post spoilers so I'll try to be vague but the casino scene was my only complaint. It was completely unnecessary and didn't make very much sense except to keep a few characters busy. I loved the humor in the movie and loved the way Luke was portrayed. He was the same boy that was found on that desert planet so many years ago. He had the same flaws and strengths. The Rey and Kylo connection was brilliant. Those two characters were so well developed and Kylo becomes a villian that I hate to hate. The movie was very enjoyable!!","true":true}
