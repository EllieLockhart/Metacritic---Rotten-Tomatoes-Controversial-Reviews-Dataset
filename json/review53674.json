Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the haters\\, consider how you have viewed Luke Skywalker in the last 35 years.  Haven't you built him up in your minds as the somewhat flawless hero\\, achieving Jedi Master status (debatable)\\, and have practically deified him in your minds and hearts?  I was right there with you\\, trust me\\, having experienced the original trilogy as a kid\\, and having far more numerous adventures in my imagination with many of the toys.  But when I saw Last Jedi it made me realize how human Luke really is\\, was\\, and should be.  Especially when even Luke says he was made legend.  He didn't see himself that way\\, and no Light Side Jedi should!  Luke was not devoid of fears.  No Jedi is.  There will always be the temptation caused by those fears.  The temptation to the Dark Side.  And when Luke fails not just his group of Padawans\\, but his nephew\\, his best friend Han's son\\, his sister's son......and when he suddenly realizes and fears what Ben Solo can\/will become\\, he almost takes Dark Side action against him.  Like a Force ghost Yoda tells him\\, the one thing Luke didn't necessarily learn is how to truly fail\\, and move past it.  He failed on Dagobah time and time again.he was human.  Unfortunately due to the stakes\\, Luke even cuts himself off from the Force.  And his final sacrifice\\, in his elder years\\, was to save his friends and family from certain destruction. He is still the hero.  He is the hero wwe all need.  Not a deity worshipped by fans.  Do you know the Legend or the Man?  If you were in his place how would you handle such universal praise (pun intended)?   You would rather be understood as a person\\, not the inflated Legend.  And for tha is why I wholeheartedly accept Luke in \\\"The Last Jedi\\\".","true":true}
