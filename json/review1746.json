Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars' fan\\, I can't help but feel overtly zealous abt The Last Jedi. I was so ready to pick my jaw off the floor when the credit rolls\\, my mind blown to smithereens. But perhaps all that crushing weight of unreal expectation gave the movie a hairline-fracture it didn't deserve..at least that's how it felt watching it the first time. The second time I went dispelled my pet peeves as I absorbed the finer details and the little things that made the overall experience so gratifying.","true":true}
