Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars\\, I liked the force awakens even though I had a few problems with it. This movie however takes those problems and multiplies them. It would take way too long to explain everything wrong with this movie\\, but in short it was just very bad story telling that basically took everything from the previous movie and threw it away. It was very\\, very disappointing!","true":true}
