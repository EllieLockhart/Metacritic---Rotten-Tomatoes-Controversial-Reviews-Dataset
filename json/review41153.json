Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has destroyed the Star Wars franchise for me.  It is hard to imagine a worse movie.  \\n\\nThe original Star Wars was based on a tremendous story coupled with amazing graphics (for the time).  This Star Wars has amazing graphics\\, but completely and utterly lacks any semblance of a story.  It is unbelievable to me that this screenplay was ever approved?  This movie is a slap in the face to any one who takes the lore of Star Wars seriously.  It is hard for me to articulate the depth of my disappointment with this movie and with Disney in general.  \\n\\nBecause the original Star Wars was so good\\, 30 and 40 years later the franchise still persists.  It is the old adage that you reap what you sow.  The results that this movie is getting have little or nothing to do with the quality of this film and instead are driven by the coattails of the original movies.  However\\, this latest movie is so bad - such an affront - that it will be interesting to see how the next movie suffers.  I for one will not buying any more Star Wars stuff\\, or watching the next movie.","true":true}
