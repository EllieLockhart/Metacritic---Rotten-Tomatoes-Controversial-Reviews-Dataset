Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never written a review online but after what I just saw\\, I couldn't stay silent. Likely everything I feel in my broken heart has been said by numerous disappointed fans but it bares repeating. This was an absolute abomination of a Star Wars film that not only destroyed any momentum built in the Force Awakens but effectively ruins decades of lore and cherished characters. Rian Johnson should never set foot near Star Wars again (he was given the next trilogy) and Kathleen Kennedy should be replaced immediately. This may be overdramatic but to me\\, I felt like a family member died when I walked out of the theater. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
