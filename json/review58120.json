Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie since Attack of The Clones. A complete disjointed mess that breaks the rules of the already established lore. It completely disrespects the original story and forgets that the previous film even existed. It's clear that Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson don't understand Star Wars and gave us this mediocrity as is because they know the general population will eat it up and still call it good. I had no fan theories and only wanted a good story. Not some bland rehash that tries to be subversive but does so in an extremely flawed way. Rogue One was a much better movie because Gareth Edwards actually respected the franchise and its rules while still entertaining us with new characters and a new story.","true":true}
