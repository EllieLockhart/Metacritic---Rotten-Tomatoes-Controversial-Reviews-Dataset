Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hear me out\\, I wanted to absolutely love this as much and even more than The Force Awakens\\, sadly that was not the case. The Last Jedi is a very good movie but there is just too much that bothered me\\, even as a fan. Theres way too much they want you to focus on for about the first hour and 15 minutes and it felt like it was all over the place. Some scenes felt very weird and odd and looked like they belonged in a Star Wars prequel. Dont get me wrong this movie has its awesome moments\\, especially those last 45 minutes which had me fan boying along with the audience. Its one of those movies that I need a rewatch because I do think that on a rewatch the problems I had with this movie will make me enjoy it a little more\\, similar to Justice League last month A-","true":true}
