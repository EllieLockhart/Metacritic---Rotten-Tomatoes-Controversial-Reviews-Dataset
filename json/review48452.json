Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without giving out much - it is different SW movie but perfect as the last one\\, maybe even more. Yes\\, there are scenes I am not much fan of\\, but in the end all was played well and it made amazing movie","true":true}
