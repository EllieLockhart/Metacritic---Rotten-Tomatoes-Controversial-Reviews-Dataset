Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was the latest most racist entry in a long history of racism in the Star Wars movie\\, first of all Poe Dameron was turned for some weird reason with no context whatsoever but to create drama within the rebellion as an old stereotype of the hotheaded latino\\, with no canon to back that whatsoever\\, seeing his gentle smile in the Force Awakens\\, the way he let Finn take the risk for the first mission\\, waiting to help him\\, while in comics being written as a gentle but firm and loyal leader\\, marred by his own losses of friends and people along the way\\, always considerate. Rian Johnson wasn't satisfied with that characterization and for his Kylo Ren fanfic chose to ignore all that development from JJ Abrams\\, comic book writers and Pablo Hidalgo and introduce the version of white and buzzfeed feminism of a powerful leader in the form of condescending racist Holdo.\\nHoldo not only diminishes Poe at every turn and never explains to herself because why would she in a rebellion were chain of command matters little but to save lives does\\, but she manages to diminish Finn and Rose as well\\, and the film leads us to believe as well that their actions matter\\, but unless people of color are being abused for comic relief (Finn)\\, becoming martyrs (Cassian Andor\\, Bohdi\\, Chirrut Imwe\\, Baze of Rogue and the last victim\\, Paige Tico) they have no business mattering to the plot.\\nFinn goes from selfless stormtrooper turned Resistance fighter\\, to somehow selfish for wanting to save the other one person to ever recognize his own humanity\\, Rose abuses him for laughs\\, calls him traitor for not wanting to stay in a place most likely to die to save another life\\, somehow not being in a cause you weren't in for the in the first place manages to make you a traitor. Change scenes to the casino planet\\, and somehow the Resistance gets turn into a parallel to a genocidal fascist child-slaver brainwashing organization\\, the First Order\\, for somehow not caring about the enslaving going on in said Casino Planet\\, and for buying weapons to fight said aforementioned genocidal regime\\, which may I remind you\\, indeed murdered five planets with billions of other children\\, babies\\, women and men\\, and somehow we're still not talking about what Kylo Ren has truly managed to do in the Dark Side. All of this is explained to Finn as if he was a dumb ass being exposed to abuse for the first time\\, as if he hadn't being taken as a newborn\\, suffered abuse\\, brainwashing\\, becoming a number\\, instead of explaining him as the true extent of abuse and power of the structures of oppression\\, he's treated like an idiot for not caring with some of the shittiest photography I have ever seen in a film. Finn somehow has to redeem himself\\, because defecting an analogue-to-nazism regime wasn't enough\\, and to help destroy the planet murderer wasn't enough. All because he was brainwashed\\, that is still his fault\\, at least I've seen reviewers explain it that way\\, forgetting obviously all characterization done by Abrams in the previous film.\\nAnd then we have Rose\\, which beyond her relationship with her sister\\, exists to belittle Finn\\, her mission in the end is senseless due to white feminism\\, and she somehow fall in love with Finn in less than 18 hours\\, yes she opens the idea of more places to save but manages to detract from the plot\\, in what could have been an incredible female entry to the Star Wars universe.\\nThe worse part\\, the three characters mentioned above managed to be destroyed for their amazing introductions to a new generation who might need this diverse roster of heroes when they themselves might be latino\\, black or Chinese\\, female or male in less screentime than the white characters managed to take away from every other character.\\nI missed every supposed joke and comic beat to Rian Johnson's fascist propaganda mess\\, I don't remember one person laughing in my audience\\, I don't remember laughing\\, I remember looking out for what makes the usual second serving of Star Wars in a trilogy\\, iconic. And missing it all\\, because it wasn't there\\, Mark Hamill has said this Luke is not his Luke\\, and who can blame him\\, he's not mine either\\, sweet hopeful filled with love farmboy somehow loses it all with one spoiled brat who somehow blames his turn to the dark which he can't even explain successfully to that one moment of weakness from Luke\\, and the worst part\\, there's a white woman there to serve every bit of apologism needed from her\\, she caters to that need of white men to be procured and kept safe\\, but there's not one thing redeemable in his actions. Because even acknowledging the one moment of weakness in Luke\\, his good heart in every other movie\\, his good deeds\\, his hand refusing to raise even from his own father\\, even if it really could happen in a world where Luke was written by someone who cared for his actual character\\, it doesn't excuse Kylo murdering children\\, Kylo committing 5 holocausts\\, Kylo joining a regime meant to murder\\, oppress and install space fascism.\\nAnd the movie really wants us to buy this racist storytelling\\, that white men's actions are excusable at every turn\\, that a black boy exists for comic relief and to have his character  butched in favor of a nonsensical drama\\, and I'm so sorry that Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega\\, and even Oscar Isaac left with such bad taste the movie\\, and the filming\\, because they knew a mediocre white man got all the time for him\\, their abilities\\, their development were hindered in favor of white storytelling\\, in favor of a narrative meant to diminish them\\, to uphold whitesplaining\\, in the form of Holdo\\, in the form of Leia\\, in the form of Kylo\\, I'm so sad\\, the last episode Carrie Fisher ever did shall be reviled like this\\, because it managed to destroy what was the start of an incredible story from JJ Abrams mind\\, I hope he can fix it\\, but for now\\, this story closes appropriately with yet another white kid using the Force\\, it has been almost twelve years since Mace Windu\\, and honestly at this point\\, we're tired\\, this saga is tired of its own whiteness\\, but they managed to turn it into a really toxic message\\, forgive your white supremacists\\, your Nazis\\, because maybe they have a reason to want ethnic cleansing\\, to be genocidal egomaniacs\\, maybe they deserve it\\, somehow\\, over the victims of their murder\\, abuse and racist feelings\\, they are human too\\, but that's what so few people get\\, that's what scares us\\, the face of such anger and hate in the face of humans like us.\\nThis movie is a sad ode to the alt-right\\, and Rian Johnson must be satisfied\\, Disney too\\, since they paid for most critics and the movie and Trump's campaigns\\, but I'm glad to see the audience's backlash\\, because this movie deserve every single time of bad press it gets.","true":true}
