Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally watched this\\, I can only say that I didn't like the previous one and knew this was going the wrong way and boy was I in for one of the most pointless movies ever with a useless plot and the dumbest death of one of the most beloved carachters in movie history!!! Just don't even waste your time on this one\\, avoid at all cost! Hell rewatch every other star wars trilogy or prequels\\, they are wayyy better that this piece of rubbish!!!","true":true}
