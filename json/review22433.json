Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left theatre so disappointed.  I'm a casual franchise fan and enjoyed The Force Awakens. Like the new characters but this film did zero to advance the plot or make me care about what happens next. Older characters were mishandled or discarded.  New characters had little or no growth. Pointless sub plot.  Cringeworthy humor.  Did not feel like a Star Wars movie to me.","true":true}
