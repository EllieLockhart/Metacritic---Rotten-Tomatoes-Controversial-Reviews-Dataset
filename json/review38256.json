Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The whole fade away Jedi deaths were never satisfying. Obi Wan's was especially egregious in an otherwise lovely film. Then Yoda and we kind of had to accept that but it didn't fix Obi Wan's pointless\\, needless death. And now this. This is unacceptable. The man had so much more to offer in life. As if Obi Wan's futile\\, meaningless death all over again. I was never more done with Star Wars than I am today.","true":true}
