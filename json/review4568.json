Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Click on Lisa K\\, who posted an interesting comment about every negative comment basically coming from \\\"fascist\\\" people and giving this shit of a movie an overrated score and you'll get a PAGE NOT FOUND ERROR.\\nThis is how Disney's damage control works. Shills. Paid shills most probably. \\nYou can write whatever you want\\, but your dirty trick worked this time but will not work for Solo or Star Wars 9. They will go directly down the toilet.","true":true}
