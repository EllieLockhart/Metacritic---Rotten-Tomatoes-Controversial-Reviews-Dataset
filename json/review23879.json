Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Major disappointment.  Major plot holes\\, even more so in TLJ than in TFA.  None of the plot holes\/questions from TFA are answered in TLJ.  Characters are killed off like tossing trash away.  The whole movie takes place in a span of literally 18hours and yet Rey becomes Force Master level surpassing even Kylo Ren.","true":true}
