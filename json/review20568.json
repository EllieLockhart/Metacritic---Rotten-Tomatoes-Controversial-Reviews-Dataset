Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never bothered to put my two cents into reviews and this is my first the movie destroyed everything. the closest thing I can compare it to is if Disney bought Star Trek and got rid of the Enterprise! kiss it Disney and your SJW BS!","true":true}
