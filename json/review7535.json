Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is upset that this movie is not what they wanted\\, but everyone was also upset when TFA was too similar to the OT. I for one am happy that they're trying new things and the franchise is on the right path IMO. Very fun and exciting movie\\, not a dull moment.","true":true}
