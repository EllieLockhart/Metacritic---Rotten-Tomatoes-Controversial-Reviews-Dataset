Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst in the series definitely. SJW plot points throughout. Bad guys are all white men\\, star destroyer called \\\"The Supremacy\\\"\\, men are buffoons or previous heroes killed off.
