Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The main new theme\\, I guess you could call it Rose's theme\\, is also the theme to My Girl. Every time they played it I was pulled out of the movie. The last movie made it clear that Finn is not a pilot. Guess he took lessons while he was in a coma. Also\\, the entire Finn plot and the entire Leia gets injured plot are wastes of time. It felt like they just needed something for these characters to do. That's all I'll say because most of my other thoughts have already been echoed.","true":true}
