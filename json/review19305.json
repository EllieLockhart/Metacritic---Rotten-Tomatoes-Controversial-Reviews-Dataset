Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its not the actors themselves that are bad\\, they're all fantastic\\, but this attempt on the Star Wars trilogy somehow manages to not have the soul and life that the prequels had.\\n\\nIt is hard to connect with any of the characters whatsoever\\, and the movie felt long.\\n\\nCGI is great and all\\, but you need great storytelling and writing to go with it and I just was not feeling it with this.","true":true}
