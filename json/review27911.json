Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pleasantly surprised by plot twists\\, and while some may not have liked the extended plot with dual climaxes\\, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. My critique is the focus on the chase with the Supremacy...the entire setting felt drawn out.","true":true}
