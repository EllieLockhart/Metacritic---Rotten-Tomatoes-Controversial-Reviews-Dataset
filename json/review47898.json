Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While Disney is still raking in $ from the origonal characters\\, ie the new Han Solo movie comming\\, their explanation of a new path for the Star Wars is BS. They destroyed the entire series by not embracing the prior movies just for the directors ego of wanting to do it \\\"his way\\\" Watched the origonal when I was 4 at the theater and have not missed one yet. I am so disgusted\\, i will not watch any new ones. Nice job a$$ hat. Destroyed the best franchise in hhistory","true":true}
