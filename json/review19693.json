Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great addition to the Star Wars Saga\\, but definitely not without its flaws. The film drags some in the middle\\, but also has some of the most spectacular scenes in the Star Wars franchise. The Throne Room fight scene and kamikaze left me speechless in the theater. The continuation of Ray's growth as a character and the relationship between her and Ben was definitely the strongest part of the film\\, and probably the best character development show in the franchise. I did not mind the change that was made to Luke. While I understand it is hard to see your childhood heros fall\\, it was a grounded tale. No one is perfect\\, and everyone has done things in their life they regret. If anything it follows the trend set in the Skywalker legacy and builds on his possible turn to the dark side in Return of the Jedi. I do agree however that the casino subplot could have been removed\\, it added nothing\\, and the Admiral not revealing her plan was dumb. But to anyone who said it was worse than the prequels\\, It just simply is not true. To all of those who hated it I recommend a second viewing\\, your opinion of it might change watching it for what it is and not what you expected it to be.","true":true}
