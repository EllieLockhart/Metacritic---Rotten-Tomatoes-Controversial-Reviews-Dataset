Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We all have our opinions in how the Star Wars saga moves forward.  I was just as surprised and confused at some plot directions.  So\\, I got over myself and just started to enjoy the movie and it was great.  Certain expectations didn't happen\\, some did happen\\, and I predicted a few new things that happened.  I hope the Star Wars saga can expand as this movie was great but it was limited to essentially an extended battleship scene.  Overall I loved this movie\\, it's taking Star Wars and moving it forward from the previous 7 films (8) and I look forward to Ep 9\\, spinoff films\\, stand alone films\\, and all else that comes with it.","true":true}
