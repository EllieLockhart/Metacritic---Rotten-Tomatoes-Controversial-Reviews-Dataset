Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is indeed the best Star Wars movie I've seen\\, as it's totally original and delivers satisfying surprises in it's plot\\, perhaps the new aproach to older characters like Luke could be cuestionable\\, their is no doubt that it was pretty interesting take on the character\\, adding more depth to the story\\, and in my opinion the new uses of the force are justified and tremendous\\, plus a movie is only as good as the ability to transport you\\, and I couldn't found myself more invested in a movie this year as I was when Kyle Ren and Rey fought side to side against the imperial guards.","true":true}
