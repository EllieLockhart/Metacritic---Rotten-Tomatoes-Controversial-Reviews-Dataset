Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A tired idea that really goes no where within the canon and deviates from any coherent direction other than down. Also\\, a side note\\, the gender politics in this movie are very obvious. As if Hollywood believes that the audience is oblivious to these tactics. Its very obvious and therefor detracts from any sense of reality that these movies were good at creating in the original series\\, a \\\"believable\\\" universe if you will. Politics really needs to get out of the film industry\\, it's just cringe at this point.","true":true}
