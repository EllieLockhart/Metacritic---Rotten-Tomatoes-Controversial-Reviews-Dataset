Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was an okay movie\\, but didn\u2019t feel like a Star Wars movie. I\u2019m so disappointed by this movie. Way to much comedy. This seemed more like Harry Potter meets Guardians of the Galaxy. ","true":true}
