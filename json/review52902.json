Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An astoundingly beautiful film. It took everything we expected and turned it on it's head. TLJ brilliantly deconstructs the things we've come to think we know about the Star Wars universe and what it means to be  part of it. It focused more on producing a great film with engaging characters and emotional payoff than confirming fan-servicy internet theories. The direction this movie takes our heroes is honestly very exciting. I'll give this movie a 9.75\/10","true":true}
