Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson cannot write. The \\\"top critics\\\" must have been paid to give this good reviews. I liked TFA and I hope JJ makes the 3rd one good and the final trilogy is just a big turd sandwich.","true":true}
