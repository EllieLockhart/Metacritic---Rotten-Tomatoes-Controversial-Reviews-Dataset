Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had so much potential for greatness. Sadly\\, Rey's lack of any character\\, Kylo Ren is just whiny kid with teen angst (\\\"He didn't like my helmet... waa waa...\\\") and Luke is not the jedi badass we all deserved; he's just a grumpy old man who dies like a fart in the wind. Only redeeming features were a cool fight in the throne and a Yoda force ghost scene.\\n\\nRian Johnson should never be allowed anywhere near the franchise again.\\n\\nCan Disney stop thinking about turnover and actually allow the fans to make the film they've always wanted?","true":true}
