Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst of the franchise. Luke drinks space milk from a space cow and Le\u00eda can space fly. Also there is gravity and a space chase for 2 hours because in weightless deep space a larger ship is slower And Luke is a sleepwalking assassin hermit that leaves a map to be found because he doesn\u2019t want to be found. Please don\u2019t waste your time on this garbage. ","true":true}
