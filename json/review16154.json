Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im fine with Star Wars changing from the basic formula that made it great\\, but I feel like they changed the wrong things. If you want to do crazy stuff with Star Wars there is a ton of legends material to play around with. If you watch the screen rant pitch meetings of this and the force awakens\\, they will lay out most everything that's wrong.","true":true}
