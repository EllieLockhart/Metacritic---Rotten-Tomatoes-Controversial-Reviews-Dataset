Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd love to write a review but as a life long star wars fan\\, I'd be typing for days. Plot was awful\\, acting was bad\\, jokes were bad. I wasn't happy with Abrams but Jesus this movie mad him look like a God. I hope Disney doesn't ruin the next one also.","true":true}
