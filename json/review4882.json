Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Contains both good and bad\\, for me the bad is more than the good. 2 stars. Some of my favourite scenes of Star Wars are in this movie\\, at the same time MOST of my least favourite ones are also in here. Odd sensation.","true":true}
