Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did Disney buy all those good reviews? I had hopes somewhat with TFA. It all got destroyed with TLJ - I wish I wouldn't have seen it. A complete unnecessary romantic sideline with a forgettable character; Yoda gets 2 minutes screentime and Luke get degraded to an old grumpy coward. Leia is apparently a death defying Mary Poppins. No one explains the ultimate evil Snoke\\, or answers the questions we were asking ourselves after TFA. There is so many things wrong with this movie\\, so many plotholes and forced jokes a la Guardians of the Galaxy\\, I'm asking myself what I just watched. I am starting to think any random person could've written a better script than this.","true":true}
