Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely abysmal. A load of contrived nonsensical rubbish. The worst of it for me is that Disney are completely destroying the magic of the originals with this horrendous garbage. I will not be returning for a third helping of this kind of boring shoddy unoriginal mess.","true":true}
