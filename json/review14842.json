Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I heard that Disney is searching for a location in New Mexico to bury the unsold DVDs and BluRays of this movie. They are searching for a landfill big enough to accommodate also millions of unsold action figures of Comedy Relief Finn\\, Whatshername Asian Girl and Mary Sue Rey that have remained on the shelves even at a super discounted price of 1 dollar.\\nAt the time of writing\\, Atari refused to comment on Disney alleged request for consultancy on the matter.","true":true}
