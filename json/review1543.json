Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long star wars fan and the son of a lifelong fan\\, i have to be supportive of the franchise and of the fandom. That being said i want to see better story telling and less lip service to the minority of PC cultural enthusiasts who dont respect the franchise or its fandom. The latest Disney movies are beautiful and fun to see once but not good enough to be considered great or even good star wars movies\\, and the fandom has proven this as the decline in merch sales for this movie have plummeted while the return investments for investments of the franchise as a whole is stagnant. Disney\\, no one wants too see star wars fail\\, especially the fandom\\, but if you dont want star wars fans boycotting your movies over this SJW fad\\, then you need to find the roots that made this franchise wildly profitable and its fandom proud again.","true":true}
