Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Messed up their chance to get rid of the worst actor in the new series! It was the perfect spot for them to kill off Finn. He is just such a crappy actor! He is way to dramatic and sucks at fake emotion. he is trying to be a character he himself is not and are incapable of displaying. OHH and the who Black on Rye\\, yeah I called that the moment she saw him at the escape pods. Try to be original one new series\\, all your doing is replaying old events with new content. I was hoping to see more of the Space western that wasn't shown before... but no. Especially this movie\\, it was based on 1 on going event. EVEN HOTH had more content in the move!!!! This series is such shit I don;t want to waste anymore time here so This is all I'm putting.","true":true}
