Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't offset the hate against this movie\\, and I'm not even going to try to convince you that it's amazing.  But it was a good development of the story\\, pushing characters into uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory.  It was not a perfect film\\, but there are moments that were amazing and others that I disliked.  When I walked out\\, I was still thinking and processing what I'd just seen.  Unlike ep1\\, i wasn't coming down off of a lightsaber fight high; this film ended on a more somber note\\, so I was thinking about the overall experience.  I've seen it a couple more times since then\\, and it continues to satisfy me\\, if not for all of the \\\"what if\\\" theories I'd come up with\\, then for the \\\"here's how it is\\\" statements that closed up those suppositions.  Little kids won't like this movie's heavy tones\\, but that's fine.  Star Wars is 40 years old\\, it's ok to grow up a little.","true":true}
