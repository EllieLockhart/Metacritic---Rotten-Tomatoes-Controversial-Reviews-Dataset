A story in a very hostile world that will end some beloved character\u2019s lives. It also introduces many new characters\\, e.g. Abby who kills Joel at the beginning of the game. That death was a real shock (especially after playing the first game) but it fits into a world where there is no government\\, no rules and no law. It\u2018s a modern Wild West where revenge creates more revenge. At first I hated Abby for what she did\\, but after playing the second half of the game I was glad how the final confrontation ended. I wanted her and Lev to survive as I could understand her motivation at the beginning of the game. And I really felt like she changed over the course of the game. Please don\u2018t believe these review bombers. Naughty dog introduced some LGBTQ+ characters in this game but I (a 30 year old white cis male) never had the feeling they were forced into it. They fit so good in the story. Especially Lev - a trans character growing up in a religious fundamental environment. I\u2018ll never know how it feels to grow up in such a hostile group of people that want to kill you for who you are. But I\u2018m glad he found Abby who accepts him for who he is. You see I\u2018m texting about fictional characters as if they\u2018re real existing persons. That\u2018s what Naughty Dog did with this game - it made me forget it is a game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
