Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dont listen to the haters\\, this movie is great. The thing i love so much about this movie is that its a good middle arc\\, its a character driven\\, character centered film\\, i think thats part of what everyone is dissapointed about\\, this movies first and second act arent constantly moving\\, we take time to stay in place and focus on the here and now.\\nThis movie takes the classic struggle of good vs light and throws it away\\, this trilogy is moving towards the in between\\, kylo and rey and even luke arent set on one side they are always moving and developing. Snoke is something a lot of people are complaining about\\, he had one purpose\\, to develop rey and kylos storylines and move the story along\\, he served his purpose very well. Another thing a lot of people are pissy about is luke\\, this is the one ive heard about the most\\, lukes old\\, hes been through shit\\, of course he ran away\\, its explained in the movie i shouldnt have to explain it here\\, he did exactly what he needed to\\, passed the torch down to rey. upon first viewing the movie does feel as long as its run time is\\, however  im sure in future viewings that will undoubtedly change\\, now that i know what to expect. go see this movie\\, the haters are either complaining about it being \\\"political\\\" when its not\\, or OT purists \\, mainly hating on the direction they took luke which was the right direction for him. one of the best of the franchise.","true":true}
