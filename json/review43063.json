Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was written by checking marketing needs with no regard to logic or good storytelling. A huge miss. It's really hard to believe that the critics completely overlook all the plot holes\\, bad character development\\, and logical absurdities. It really makes you wonder if the Disney marketing machine paid them off.","true":true}
