Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved The Force Awakens. I loved how exciting it was and that it re-ignited the fire of Star Wars in everybody. It presented new questions and mysteries for us to think about and speculate. I felt like a kid again watching it. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, does NONE of that. This film throws away everything that JJ had set up so brilliantly in The Force Awakens and craps all over the Star Wars universe. The more I think about this movie the more I hate it. There are so many flaws in this story it is inconceivable that a Star Wars movie got made with it. The most painful betrayal of this movie is of course its handling of Luke Skywalker. I don't know who I was watching\\, but it wasn't him.\\n\\nWell done Rian Johnson and Disney you have ruined this franchise with your selfish take on what this story should have been instead of what would have been a brilliant and compelling story for everyone. I have 0 excitement for where this story can now go and I won't be 'pre-purchasing' my tickets for episode IX in anticipation. \\n\\nGood luck JJ Abrams for Episode IX. You're gonna need it.","true":true}
