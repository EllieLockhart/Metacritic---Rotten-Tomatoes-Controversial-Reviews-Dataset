Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible\\, awfully-paced\\, tone-deaf\\, hot mess of a movie. It's as if it were written by someone with asperger's\\, for an audience of autistic teenagers (i\\,e millennials). It breaks continuity\\, and it ruins the hype built-up by the force awakens. There are absolutely no pay-offs from abrams' reboot. There aren't pay-offs from supporting characters's side quest in the film itself (finn\/rose). Heck it feels so disjointed and atonal\\, it might as well be its own reboot. The lack of direction on the franchise is clearly showing. The fact that they insert tons of \\\"tension-diffusing\\\"\\, marvel-style\\, awkward jokes\\, tells you that disney just doesn't know what to do with it. Disney keeps gobbling up other film companies (they just bought fox films). Imagine what other franchises they will ruin in the future. Yikes! This is why monopolies suck!\\nThe ratings on here say it all. 300+ mostly positive reviews from critics who don't want to be locked out of seeing future disney pre-release screenings for giving bad reviews\\, vs 170\\,000 non-critics who either hated it\\, or mildly liked it. And the reviews from non-critics who liked it\\, mysteriously enough\\, write only one-liners that could have been easily produced by an indian click-farm.","true":true}
