Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is utter **** and goes against everything that was once great in Star Wars. I can\u00b4t understand how a gigantic company like Disney has worse writing than some of the dumbest fan ficitions and doesent care at all that their entire storie has plot holes and logic issues. Disney ruined a legacy which united fans for 40+ years and they managed to destroy it in that short amount of time thanks to Kathleen Kennedy\\,l Ryan Johnson etc. (both should have never been let even near Star Wars). And as if that wasnt enought every argument and critics brought up against their movies get turned down by playing the \\\"sexist-card\\\"\\, feminism-propagandas or simply by painting the fanbase as stupid nerds\\, who arent able to get the point of the movie. What a way to treat die hard fans - its almost ciminal. Disney wont see any money from me im boycotting every Disney-Star Wars movie from now until Kennedy etc. are gone and i can only feel sorry for the way they treated poor Mark Hamil who seems really devestated by everything they did to his\/our beloved Galaxy. For me ther are only Episode 1-6\\, Rogue One and all the legends in the EU not the abomination of plotholes disney created...","true":true}
