Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This entire movie is garbage\\, Johnson killed this entire Trilogy trying to be clever but never succeeds any any story telling or set up. Visually an amazing movie\\, other than that you watch 2.5 hours of movie to get about 15 min of actual story that does nothing to add to what Force Awakens started. None of these characters matter\\, the Original Trilogy doesn't matter. There's no purpose to this film and besides Luke meeting R2 again and the Praetorian Guards (Pretty much the only combat scene in this movie). They should just apologize\\, remove this film from the trilogy and re-release episode 8 again under Abrams and a script that actual benefits the characters development and bring some back story into how we got to this point. Scared Luke and Cry-baby Kylo are just a mockery to this franchise. How did Snoke even get to power and Knights of Ren are just a rumor and have no purpose to this entire story so far. Seriously couldn't be more disappointed in a movie especially one bearing the name Star Wars. So sad.....have zero interest in episode 9.","true":true}
