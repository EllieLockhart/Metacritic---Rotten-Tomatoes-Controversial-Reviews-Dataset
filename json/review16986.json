Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I realize this movie was divisive between fans. But for me\\, I thought it was a great and fresh story where I honestly did not know what was going to happen next. Not nearly as predictable as its previous installment. I shed tears at points at how well they had honored my childhood\\, though as many will agree the ending just hurt too much. Even so\\, a wonderful film and welcome addition to the star wars saga. I definitely recommend seeing this and I will need to rewatch a dozen times to take in every detail.","true":true}
