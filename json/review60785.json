Well done in media advertising but as a player who experienced First TLOU\\, this is entirely a joke. The scriptwriters hated firat gen characters so much that most them died or badly injured. Tommy came out as the only guy survived throughout the whole game with a severely injured body. Those who gave high score definitely did not appreciate how interesting was the first game. The characters development was so good compared to the second part. Joel used to not trust anyone and now telling outsiders who he is?  Heavily pregnant Mel running around like her belly made by metal? Same logic goes to Dinah. Ellie overcame so much just to forgive the one she hated the most even she vowed not to let her go throughout the story? Abby saved two children from opposition gang and protected them juz bcos they are young but did not hesitate to kill Joel who saved her as well! No mention of Jesse the father of Dinah's child after one year event at all but instead D+E?  Messy timeline especially the ending part could have ended at the farm.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
