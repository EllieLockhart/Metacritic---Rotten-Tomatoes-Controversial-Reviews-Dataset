Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The hype didn\u2019t live up to expectations. Still too many unanswered questions. Shame I had high hopes for this film\\, hoping it would be as good or even better than the Empire Strikes Back\\, but sadly not. Great visuals\\, great battles scenes. Fingers crossed for Episode 9.","true":true}
