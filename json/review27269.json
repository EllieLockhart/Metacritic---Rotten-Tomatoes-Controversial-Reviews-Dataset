Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On its own\\, I'd rank the film as just below average\\, but compared to the previous two releases in the Star Wars franchise\\, it's horrible.\\nIt had some solid moments\\, particularly involving the character development of Kylo Ren and one exceptional scene where Luke talks to an old friend\\, but overall the film was a mess of awkward comic relief\\, an absolutely unneeded side-plot\\, and filler fit for a Straight-To-DVD childrens' film.\\n\\nNevertheless\\, this film doesn't deserve a 75% critic score\\, let alone 93%.","true":true}
