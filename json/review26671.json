Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, it is Star Wars. There is no real bad guy\\, there are no real secrets that we need to figure out. Kylo Ren is a winy third grader\\, and they destroyed Luke's legacy. The ships and walkers were awesome\\, and were only on the screen in action for about four minutes. All in all\\, I like the movie\\, although\\, was expecintg A LOT more intrique and mystery. There was absolutly none.","true":true}
