Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something felt off the entire movie. I enjoyed Rouge One much more\\, the Star Wars story is so deep and there were (and still are) so many questions that were not addressed. (Is Snoke Darth Plagues or possibly Darth Sidious that survived the fall...) (Is Rey also conceived by the midichlorians\\, like Anakin) \\n\\nLuke felt COMPLETELY out of character for me. And the milk drinking scene just left a blank look on my face. Princess Leia has the Force\\, we know that (\\\"The Force is strong in my family\\, I have it\\, etc...\\\") but the space dragging? I don't know. \\nThis is my opinion\\, it didn't feel right. It was like the movie was a spin off and not part of the original saga.\\n\\nInteresting Trivia...(Google it)\\n\\nAfter reading the script for the film\\, Mark Hamill told director Rian Johnson\\, \\\"I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character [Luke Skywalker]. Now\\, having said that\\, I have gotten it off my chest\\, and my job now is to take what you've created and do my best to realize your vision.\\\"","true":true}
