Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie so far. I don't want to see feminist propaganda in a Star Wars movie. All the male characters seem to be either cowards\\, stupid\\, or comic relief. Luke would not try to kill his nephew while he slept\\, and then say F$%k it and run off and hide. I understand Disney wants a new audience\\, but Luke should have flown the X-Wing to the salt planet\\, and went out like a boss. Rey has the power of a Jedi Master with almost no training. They killed Admiral Ackbar off screen (how about having him make the suicide run to Snoke's ship. The build up of Snoke for no pay off. The second act was a 30 minute PETA commercial. It looks like Disney bought off the critics\\, because I don't think they watched the same movie. The Force = balance idea negates everything from the previous 2 trilogies. I mean why have a Jedi Academy at all? You don't need lessons evidently. They took 40 years of lore and trashed it. Rian Johnson obviously hates the original trilogy\\, he shat practically every character. Luke is a coward\\, Chewie cares about space pigeons feelings. Leia goes Mary Poppins. I almost walked out of the movie\\, a first for Star Wars i have been a fan for 35 plus years\\, and I think I am done. Disney does not do Star Wars justice. Save you money.","true":true}
