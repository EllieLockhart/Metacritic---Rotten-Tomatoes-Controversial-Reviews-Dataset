Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t know how the audience rating on this movie plummeted because this is one of the best movies of the franchise. Go see this movie and judge for yourself... you won\u2019t be disappointed.","true":true}
