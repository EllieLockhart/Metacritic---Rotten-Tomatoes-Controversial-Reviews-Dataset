Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly bloated while also having nothing really happen. The whole film could've been half the run time and arrived at the same place. Character motivation\\, reaction\\, and development was almost nonexistent and counter intuitive to the way they have been built in previous films. Yes\\, their reactions are unexpected but also not believable in any sense. Some segments and scenes were lifted directly from Return of the Jedi. Johnson really showed he understood how transitional cuts worked but sadly at the expense of spending any memorable amount of time with a specific story progression. The whole thing seemed jumbled together and out of place. Adam Driver did a respectable job of portraying Kylo\/Ben's daddy issues and need of acceptance but that alone is not enough to save this film from being the uneventful\\, boring mess that it was.","true":true}
