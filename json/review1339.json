Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Are you kidding me?! I avoided all previews\\, all posts\\, or any written material about this movie altogether so I can have an unbiased approach to watching this film (yeah\\, that\u2019s the type of Star Wars fan that I am). This movie literally had no story\\, no plot\\, farts on any questions you had about Episode 7\\, and basically is a dried up turd that doesn\u2019t deserve the Star Wars name. The characters actually make fun of how dumb this movie is in the actual movie. This is a GIANT letdown. I love Star Wars and actually wrote a review for the first time...ever. Let that sink in. Now the only thing left worth waiting for is when South Park makes an episode about all of this showing Luke getting raped by this horrible director. That\u2019s right ladies and gentlemen...this is an Indiana Jones Crystal Skull alert...that bad.","true":true}
