Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was so disappointing.  I loved the original Star Wars\\, and I thought Force Awakens was excellent.  I could not wait to see the next installment.  Until this film happens. The corny jokes led off by such an anticipated moment of seeing Luke Skywalker in 30 years.  I thought I was watching a Naked Gun movie.   Then all the new super powers of characters just talking to each other galaxies away.  The Mary Poppins scene with Princess Leia. The side plots to nowhere. The weird plot for Luke turning him into weirdo coward.  And then all the forced politics mentioned elsewhere. I really wish this movie never happened as it just killed off the greatness and anticipation left from the Force Awakens.","true":true}
