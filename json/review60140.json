This sequel has disappointed my expectations of this game. Its storytelling was mixed and confusing. The combat was plain boring. It took the fun out of me playing when you travel through missions and you have to try to comprehend Exactly whats going on between the players. The ending was so confusing. I atleast expected elle to get revenge from such a a horrible character. The game even expects you to play as the character that killed joel. I had no sympathy for abby because it made no sense why we have to play as the villian. Akward sex scene by the way which involved infidelity and fetishin intentions.  Overall\\, i couldnt understand why neil drukman had to do this alone. You know you cannot leave kids playing with knives because someone is going to get hurt. In conclusion\\,  the game was a mess. I wish i can return it but i downloaded the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
