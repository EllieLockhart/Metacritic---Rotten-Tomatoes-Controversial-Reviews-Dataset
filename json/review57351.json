Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is very unexpected and leads long time fans to question what they would expect in a typical star wars film. The action scenes are beautifully choreographed and the visuals are absolutely stunning. For the most part\\, all of the characters\\, new and old\\, are excellent in the film. Some of the choices in the film leave the audiences a bit unfulfilled\\, but it does not take away from the stakes the film sets. \\n    Although some fans are unpleased with the film\\, I find their excuses to be vague and unconvincing. I enjoyed the fresh cast and characters of TFA\\, despite its criticisms for being to similar to A New Hope. The movie-going community seems unsatisfied with any efforts Disney and Lucasfilm try to make in revamping the new trilogy. They are upset with TFA in being too similar and are also upset when The Last Jedi strays away and brings a new sense of uneasiness to the franchise.\\n    The Last Jedi is a fantastic addition to the Star wars franchise and is a must-watch for any fans of Star Wars or fans of film in general. Despite the film running a bit long at 2 and a half hours\\, it takes you on a thrilling journey with unexpected turns that will leave you wanting to know more.","true":true}
