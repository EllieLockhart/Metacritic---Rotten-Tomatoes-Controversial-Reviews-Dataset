Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no clue where this hate is coming from\\, I thought it was amazing and have only high hopes for the direction this series heads. The scenes are gorgeous\\, the plot is fulfilling and it gives way more than any other movie for the price of admission. 5 stars. Go see it twice!","true":true}
