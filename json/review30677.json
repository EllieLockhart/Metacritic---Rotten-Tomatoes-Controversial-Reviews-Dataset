Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Site like this lose all credibility when they allow multiple users to create multiple accounts to fill an agenda. \\n\\nI have only one thing to say. The Last Jedi is a very good Star Wars movie. It is not perfect granted but an excellent entry into the franchise. If this statement makes you mad? Then GFY.","true":true}
