Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Admiration is all I can feel towards the creativity and talent of those behind the Star Wars franchise\\, especially The Last Jedi. I am amazed by its visuals\\, story's unpredictability\\, characters and the film's effort to find its own mark amongst all the Star Wars movie. Good job Rian Johnson!","true":true}
