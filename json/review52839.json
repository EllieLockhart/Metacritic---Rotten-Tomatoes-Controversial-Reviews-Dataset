Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of potential here. While I'm open to (and had been hoping for) subversion of some of the tropes that permeate Star Wars... The director went overboard. It became more like a gimmick than something that added depth to the universe. Also\\, the deviation from cannon continues to be frustrating\\, the humor in the movie was offputting\\, and half the movie was spent telling a story that just felt superfluous. Could have been a great movie... but I found myself wanting to leave the theatre after the several faux climaxes in this film (could have trimmed a bit).","true":true}
