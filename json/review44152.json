Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To dislike this movie as a Star Wars film is to deny the spirit of Star Wars. This movie was perfectly adapted for the times\\, while maintaining the heart and soul of Star Wars. The added humor was appropriate and very  in-character. The surprises\\, the rumored relationships we hoped for\\, the character development\\, the plot twists... all of it was everything the new trilogy needed and aspired to be. This movie was meaningful\\, compelling\\, and enthralling. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Thank you to everyone involved - for breathing new life into the world of cinema (and the world of Star Wars).","true":true}
