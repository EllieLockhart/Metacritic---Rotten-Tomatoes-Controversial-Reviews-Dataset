Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It started bad enough with the 7\\, but thank you so much\\, Disney you disgusted me with Star-Wars for good!\\n\\nI wouldn't go to see the 9\\, because I think it's totally impossible to catch up with two films in one film\\, one of which is just average and the other just plain bad!\\n\\nA future trilogy in perdition!\\n\\nShe won't have any place in my video library\\, and not a penny in merchandising from me!","true":true}
