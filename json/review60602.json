Yes\\, the game can be a little cliche in a lot of moments and it does have a few writing issues (that are not that bad as people say)\\, but I love the way the game made me participant in such a conflicting story that range between love\\, hate and all the other emotions that radiate from those two. The game really made me think about the importance of our actions as humans and how those actions determine our place in this world.
