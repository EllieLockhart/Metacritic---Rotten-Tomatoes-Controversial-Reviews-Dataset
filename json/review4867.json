Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Congratulations to Mark Hamill for a mesmerizing performance.  I liked that it was nuanced with good vs evil not so black and white.  It kept me guessing with where it was going avoiding the being predictable.","true":true}
