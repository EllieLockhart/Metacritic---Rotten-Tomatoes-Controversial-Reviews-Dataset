Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made bold choices\\, and took risks I feel make this universe fresh and interesting. Having another Star Wars be predictable was not what anyone would want. Over all this is a great movie\\, but does lack in the pacing and urgency that I feel that it was reaching for. But if you are a fan of this series this movie Delivers old and new that is fans want to see. ","true":true}
