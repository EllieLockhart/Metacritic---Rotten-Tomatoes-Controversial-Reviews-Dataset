Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film ruined Star Wars for me. I have been a Fan for almost 20 years\\, loved the movies\\, the books and video games... HATE The Last Jedi. The Sequel Trilogy has nothing better to do than to burry all of your Childhood Heroes because \\\"the young audience wants to see the older generation pass the torch to a younger generation\\\"... really? This film is worse than Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace combined.","true":true}
