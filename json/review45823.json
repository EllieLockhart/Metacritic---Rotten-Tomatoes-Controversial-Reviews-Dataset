Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very poor\\, too many jokes\\, luke asks \\\"wheres han\\\" then they cut the scene right there.. so you dont even get to see lukes reaction to han solos death.. after all theyve been through and they dont continue a scene with lukes reaction to his hans death\\, dissapointing\\, alot of the plot didnt make sense with the first order\\, this star wars was a real let down.","true":true}
