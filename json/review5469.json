Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite what some traditionalist's proclaim\\, this movie was excellent.  It was nuanced and rich in depth.  Luke was still the whiner who turned into a hero that we can relate to.  I welled up at the symmetry at the end as he stared at the sunset.\\n\\nCheers to the bravery of the director who opened up new directions for a franchise that I feared would paint themselves into a corner.\\n\\nIt was a brave and correct choice.\\nI loved it.","true":true}
