Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's my official review:\\n\\nFor the new generation of fans that are just getting into Star Wars\\, this will be a grand slam... for the classic Star Wars fans that were hoping for this to be a respectable continuation of the original trilogy\\, you will be left upset\\, confused\\, and just disappointed.\\n\\nVisually this movie is amazing... the effects\\, the sets\\, everything is what you would expect from a Star Wars movie with practically an unlimited budget. The acting was great\\, and I truly do like all of the characters the new trilogy has introduced. The problem is that the story just isn't good and that Disney really \\\"Disney-fied\\\" the heck out of the franchise. Since when did Star Wars become a comedy? Every other line was some sort of forced joke or cheesy reference to the original trilogy (no pun intended\\, but I'm surprised they didn't use it - it's that bad). I understand that Star Wars has always had comedy... C-3PO\\, Jar Jar\\, even the occasional smug one-liner from Han\\, but it never felt like a comedy... just moments of comic relief.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens was much better between the two in my opinion\\, but still lacked in a hundred different ways in regards to my original expectations... but I gave it the benefit of the doubt thinking that it's just setting up the trilogy for a new story line. I was completely wrong. Disney has made the new trilogy into practically a parody of Star Wars. Everything is a joke\\, including at least a dozen re-used lines from the original trilogy. Again\\, I can't stress this enough - It just felt so forced... as if they all sat in a room and wrote down as many original trilogy jokes or references they can think of\\, and tried to fit all of them into the script. The fact is that they are trying to build this off of the original story line\\, and not a separate trilogy with completely new characters unrelated to the events in Episodes 4-6... which makes it feel like a stretch. If they would have just disconnected it and said it's a totally different story\\, without the original characters\\, it would be a lot better... don't pretend to be something it's not.\\n\\nRogue One in my opinion nailed it in almost every way. I was hoping for this to be similar\\, but it's just not. So many confusing parts\\, and things that just made zero sense. The fact they built up this mysterious Snoke character in The Force Awakens just to kill him off as an after thought without answering any questions just doesn't make sense. It's almost as if Rian Johnson didn't like JJ's ideas\\, so he just decided to get rid of him. Also\\, bringing back Luke was decades in the making\\, yet every aspect of his character was a joke in my opinion\\, just to kill him off at the end with very little purpose. The Leia scene where she's floating through space was the moment in the movie where I said there's nothing they can do to redeem themselves at this point... just dumb. Again\\, the new generation will love it because it's a fun action movie with awesome effects\\, but for those who enjoy the story\\, you will most likely be completely disappointed. \\n\\nAs an action space themed movie\\, I give it 7\/10 stars. Visually it was stunning\\, and it was a fun movie. As a Star Wars movie\\, I will give it 2\/10 stars. This is just my opinion\\, but the direction Disney has taken this franchise has just affirmed that Star Wars died when George Lucas cashed his check from the mouse himself... excluding Rogue One of course\\, which I loved most likely due to the fact that story was so heavily influenced by what Lucas already did. \\n\\nWhat a bummer...","true":true}
