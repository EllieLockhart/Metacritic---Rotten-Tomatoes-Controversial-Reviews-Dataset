Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrendous\\, obnoxious film. It burns to ashes everything this saga has been building for more than 40 years. A complete disgrace. Lazy writing\\, stupid subplots\\, excruciating character psychology and childish humor. Mr Johnson\\, I hope your hunger for self satisfaction was worth betraying millions of fans.","true":true}
