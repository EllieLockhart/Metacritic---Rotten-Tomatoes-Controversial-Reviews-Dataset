Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While TFA was very safe and familiar to a fault\\, TLJ went the opposite direction too a fault.  Rian says it was time for Star Wars to move in a new direction.  I don't entirely disagree with that\\, but I'm wondering what direction he thinks it's going now\\, since he turned the character's storylines on their heads.  The end of this film left me not caring about the characters or where the story was going.  JJ Abraham's mysteries may have been cliche\\, but at least they made me excited for the next movie.  The movie is beautiful to look at\\, but a good 30% of it seemed to be pointless filler with jokes that fell flat.","true":true}
