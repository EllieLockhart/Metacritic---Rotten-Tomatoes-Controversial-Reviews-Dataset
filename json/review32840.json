Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The plot armour awakens. Incredibly predictable and boring movie\\, filled with an overflow of characters that each held little to no meaning in my viewing. It seems as though anyone will enjoy a movie that reads \\\"Star Wars\\\" and features infamous lightsabers\\, no matter how garbage the content is.","true":true}
