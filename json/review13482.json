Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If anybody tries to tell you that the last Jedi is a travesty and an insult to the Star Wars legacy\\, then they have either never seen and understood the original trilogy or they are simply plain lying. The film is great fun and offer plenty of surprises\\, without stepping too far outside series lore. True\\, the humour is somewhat ham-fisted at times\\, but the story\\, performances and action are top notch and its a pleasure to report that the new recruits to the series from the Force Awakens are every bit as good as the original series stalwarts. Bots and haters be dammed\\, the movie is darn entertaining...","true":true}
