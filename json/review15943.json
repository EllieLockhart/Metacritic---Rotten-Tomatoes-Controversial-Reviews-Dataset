Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a big Star Wars fan and I can say this movie was bad. Waist of time for the new characters and for the old one\\, sad. I\u2019m sure Mark Hamill would of love to do more as Luke","true":true}
