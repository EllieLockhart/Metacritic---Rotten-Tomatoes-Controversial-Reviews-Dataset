Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is Disney's Order 66 on longtime Star Wars fans. \\n\\n\\\"Hunt them down. Round them up. Annihilate them.\\\"\\n\\nIt's also Order 66 on the Original Trilogy\\, and three of the most iconic characters in film history: Han Solo\\, Leia Organa\\, and Luke Skywalker. \\n\\nYou can throw in Chewbacca\\, Yoda\\, 3PO and R2 for that matter.\\n\\nTLJ is a complete\\, insulting nothing. Absolute waste of space.\\n\\nTFA and TLJ tease what everyone really wanted to see\\, which was Luke's Jedi academy\\, training\\, good Kylo\\, his fall to the Dark Side\\, the Knights of Ren\\, destroying the Jedis-in-training and leaving Luke for dead. \\n\\nThat should have been Episode 7. It would have been effing fantastic. But\\, no\\, we get the cock tease otherwise known as The Force Awakens\\, followed by The Last Jedi\\, which douses the audience in ice water and then throws the saga into the abyss.\\n\\nAfter the fall of Kylo in Episode 7\\, Episode 8 could be the fall of the New Republic after a surprise assault from the outer regions by Snoke and the First Order. Galactic warfare and desolation on a Titanic scale (instead of the slow speed search for a petrol dump the Last Jedi took). The Force Awakens\\, Rey comes to the forefront\\, Han Solo dies.\\n\\nIn Episode IX they would be set up for the grand finale between Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and whatever other baddie Abrams has planned.\\n\\nPoint is\\, they could have the story go in the same direction as they intended all along\\, but not fuck the fans with crap movies while getting there.\\n\\nTLJ is gutter trash\\, and pulls TFA into the sewer with it. \\n\\nBy the way\\, I watched the deleted scenes for free online\\, and they flesh out nothing\\, are completely awful\\, and deserved to be cut\\, along with almost every scene that actually made it into the movie.","true":true}
