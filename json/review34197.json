{"101487":172671,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Thank you to A.P.\\, Mike S.\\, and everyone else who understands why the original Star Wars trilogy is the greatest film franchise ever. Now\\, time for some fun)\\nSPOILER ALERT!: The script for Star Wars\\, Episode IX\\, \\\"The Jedi Strike Back\\,\\\" just leaked. It looks incredible! Here is a summary of the plot:\\nThe opening scroll states that after the Resistance escaped the salt planet at the end of The Last Jedi\\, Poe and Leia died after an unfortunate series of events where Poe hijacked an escape shuttle from the Millennium Falcon to go back and fight the First Order\\, but on his way he became distracted by a \\\"Hot Babes of the Empire\\\" magazine that fell from his overhead console and he consequently crashed. Leia then used the force in an attempt to revive him and fly him back through the vacuum of space. Unfortunately\\, she meditated too hard and disappeared before Poe made it back in. (Too bad we won't be able to see that because it would have been an amazing way to send off Carrie Fisher's beloved character.)\\nAfter the opening scroll\\, the camera focuses on the Falcon\\, which is flying through space and ultimately lands on a desert planet. Rey exits the ship and uses the force to kill Kylo Ren telepathically. She then immediately gets killed after being hit by falling debris from Poe's escape shuttle. (Whoa! It's surprising because the audience thinks that Kylo and Rey are important to the story but they actually aren't! What a twist!)\\nNext scene is on the island planet where Luke is resurrected by Yoda\\, who never really died in Return of the Jedi\\, he just pretended to be dead so Luke would stop bothering him and leave his hut. Yoda and Luke then go to a beach resort planet where they meet a black girl who tells them they need to save the whales. Yoda and Luke check into a hotel together so that they can discuss strategy for saving the whales. While checking in\\, Luke becomes mortified because Yoda keeps saying things to give the impression to the hotel manager that they are gay\\, such as \\\"size matters not\\,\\\" and \\\"only one bed will we need.\\\" Although Yoda says these things because he's low maintenance and likes to sleep on the floor\\, Luke doesn't realize this and the hotel manager thinks it's because they are gay\\, so Luke is embarrassed and it's really funny. (Hilarious!)\\nMeanwhile\\, there's a new empire that came up led by an old white guy named Lord Harwar. Lord Harwar nukes 4 planets. (The explosions are awesome!) After Lord Harwar nukes 4 planets\\, Finn\\, who is with Rose on a second mission to the casino planet to get the real codebreaker\\, shouts \\\"we need to stop Lord Harwar!\\\" but Rose doesn't agree and tells Finn that they need to continue on their mission so that they can save more space horses from the evil people on the casino planet. Finn obeys Rose. Next scene\\, Lord Harwar dies of a heart attack so it turns out Rose was right. Thereafter\\, Finn and Rose selflessly sacrifice themselves to save all the space horses. The young boy with Jedi powers from the end of The Last Jedi then gives the eulogy at Finn and Rose's funeral ceremony. (Having the young boy with Jedi powers from the end of The Last Jedi give the eulogy is awesome because it shows that the traditional requirement that you should have known the person during their lives in order to give a eulogy is just an outdated way of thinking. Thank you Star Wars for entering the 21st century!)\\nThen we go back to the beach resort planet and there's a huge \\\"laser sword\\\" battle between some brand new characters with no backstory that have force powers. Everyone flies up off the ground using the force\\, and they flip and move around in zero gravity despite the beach resort planet having earth-like gravity\\, so it's super awesome! Meanwhile\\, Luke and Yoda forget to save the whales because Luke is yelling at Yoda for unwittingly giving the impression that they were gay\\, and it becomes apparent that Luke is homophobic. Because the whales are starving and no one is helping them\\, the whales use the force to ignite the planet core and the world explodes. (The explosion is awesome! Additionally\\, it turns out to be a real deep part of the movie because it shows even untrained animals can use the force.)\\nThen aboard the Millennium Falcon\\, piloted by BB8\\, and carrying Chewie\\, R2D2 and C3PO\\, our remaining heroes contact Maz Kanata for advice\\, and she explains to them (while she's wearing a jet pack and participating in a blaster fight against the bartenders' union) that they need to go to a jungle planet to get a lost force gem\\, because it has the power to give force abilities to regular people. Upon arriving\\, they meet a group of thieves who help them retrieve the lost force gem. After they obtain the force gem\\, the thieves reveal themselves as the Knights of Ren and try to take the gem\\, but BB8 kills them with a laser sword. Then BB8\\, accompanied by his fellow heroes\\, flies the Falcon from the jungle planet and there's a huge space fight with TIE fighters. The Falcon barely escapes into hyperspace. (Breathtaking special effects!)\\nThen the Falcon lands on Yavin 4 and BB8 uses the force gem in an attempt to restart the Rebellion. Unfortunately\\, the force gem turns out to be a dud. However\\, in a huge twist\\, we learn that regular people don't need a force gem to use the force\\, because everyone has the force in them already\\, they just have to believe it\\, hard. Although the quest for the force gem was useless\\, BB8 is awarded a medal for its bravery. Chewie\\, who is reminded by C3PO that Yavin 4 is where the Rebellion refused to give him a medal at the end of Episode 4\\, then destroys BB8\\, C3PO and R2D2 with his bare hands. Chewie is then arrested and taken into a courtroom where he successfully pleads temporary insanity after delivering a passionate speech to the tribunal in his native tongue about how the killings were justified because BB8 didn't let him pilot the Falcon\\, and R2D2 and C3PO reminded him of Han so he just wanted to kill the past. Thereafter\\, Chewie regrets his actions and commits suicide. Then we get a shot of people all over the galaxy cheering. The end. (The Jedi Strike Back breaks all the rules\\, the special effects are awesome\\, and nothing matters\\, so it's amazing! Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes! Can't wait for December 2019!)","true":true}
