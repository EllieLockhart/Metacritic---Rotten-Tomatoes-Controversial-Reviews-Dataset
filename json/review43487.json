Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was awful. Besides all the unanswered or ignored questions from episode 7\\, besides craping all over Luke Skywalker\\, besides somehow mixing in a peta PSA\\, this was just a bad movie. Awful and ill timed jokes. Ridiculous plot holes (If Luke went there to be alone\\, why did he leave a map!?). I might have enjoyed it if it wasn't star wars\\, but it was\\, so I didn't.
