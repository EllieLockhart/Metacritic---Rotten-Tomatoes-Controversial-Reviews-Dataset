Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good film. Bad STAR WARS film. Didn\u2019t do much to expand the story. Added film elements that are lost in blockbusters. Go see it if you are a fan of cinema or STAR WARS\\, but don\u2019t expect to leave with your questions answered. ","true":true}
