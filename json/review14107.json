Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you tamper with something which is beyond your capabilities\\, despite the fact you have billions of dollars at your disposal\\, DO NOT TOUCH it. Episode VIII was supposed to be a game changer but in my opinion it  wasn't (and isn't). Disney shouldn't have turned their back on the Old Canon . The Last Jedi is a living proof of that. :(","true":true}
