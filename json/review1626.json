Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan\\, not only did The Last Jedi answer burning questions left by The Force Awakens but it reignited the purpose and mystical essence of who the Jedi were before the prequels. It gave the prequels purpose and explained why the Jedi were perceived as high\\, mighty hypocrites in the prequels. Moreover\\, it finally showed fans the force abilities that long time fans knew Leia had all along. The most gripping scene is Luke's final sacrifice\\, passing on the mantel to Rey as Obiwan did for him in a New Hope. All in all\\, Star Wars has its umph back!","true":true}
