Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning and that's all.\\nDirector and Disney trample on all Star Wars saga and trample on Ep VII.\\nAt the end there is absolutely no material left to conclude properly in Ep IX.\\nMeaningless characters\\, plot and sub plots filled with so much flaws\\, incoherences and deus ex machinas that only a 10 year old could accept this story without feeling that his intelligence is mocked at.\\nLuke character way underused\\, one stick fight with Mary Sue and he lose. Jedis are bad and useless because there is the dark side of the force. Wait pal\\, do you remember your own story? The writters obviously not. I came on this island to die. Wait pal\\, don't you remember you left a map to find you if galaxy was in danger? The writters obviously don't.\\nI won't develop on all that is incoherent on what's wrong in this film (Space rules? Lasers shooting rules? Tracking devices on light speed? Characters depth? etc etc) because it will take probably weeks.\\nUltimately\\, nothing is logic nore has a purpose this is only an arrogant insult to viewver's intelligence.","true":true}
