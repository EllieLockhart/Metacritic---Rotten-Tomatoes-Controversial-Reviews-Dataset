Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it perfect? No. But I like this new direction they're going in. I liked seeing an epic film about failure\\, and how heroes have flaws\\, and how your choices are more important than your bloodline. I liked seeing so many women! I liked having my assumptions challenged. And I loved all the new creatures. Sorry not sorry.  There were at least three moments I can think of when the audience I was watching with collectively cheered or started spontaneously clapping\\, which is always really fun.\\n\\nI'm sad to see the low audience score on here. I think this film is about shifting expectations\\, and what a lot of people are dismissing as \\\"pointless side plots\\\" or \\\"poor storytelling\\\" are actually just the filmmakers telling a story that maybe you didn't want to hear. There's a difference. This isn't a Star Wars story where the heroes place all their hope on this risky\\, \\\"don't-tell-me-the-odds\\\" plan and it somehow works out okay at the last possible second. Like I said before\\, this is a story about failure. Which means sometimes our heroes make blunders\\, spend time doing something that in another movie might tie up neatly by the end\\, but which here comes to nothing or may in fact only make things worse. As an audience watching a plot like that\\, sure\\, it's unsatisfying\\, but it does really rich things when it comes to characterization because it allows these flawed protagonists to learn and grow. In that regard this was a hard movie for the characters and the audience\\, but I welcomed a step away from the safety net of nostalgia and this feeling of being chained to the past. Kylo talks about letting the past die\\, and that's sort of what's slowly happening in these films as the old heroes find their conclusions and the new heroes step up to see us through to the end of whatever's coming. I for one look forward to following along wherever they take us next. \\n\\nStandout performances for me were Mark Hamill\\, Adam Driver\\, and Carrie Fisher. I love Daisy Ridley's portrayal of Rey but felt her emotional arc was a bit off in this installment. Rose is my favorite of the new characters (and has my favorite line in the movie) but not sure I buy her everything about her exchange with Finn in the final scenes of the film. Guess we'll just have to wait and see what comes of it.","true":true}
