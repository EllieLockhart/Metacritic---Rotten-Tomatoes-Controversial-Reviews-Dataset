Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not quite sure where to rank this yet. Some issues aside\\, a really enjoyable continuation of where TFA leaves off. It might not fulfill everyone as it\u2019s set up almost as a reboot of certain things. But the pacing\\, look and feel was mostly vintage Star Wars. I do love the fact the most recent episodes have ignored the prequels and in this one did away with the midichlorian explanation for the force and got it back to the mythology it is supposed to be. My immediate thought was again\\, thank God Lucas sold off Star Wars\\, three straight movies far better than the prequels. ","true":true}
