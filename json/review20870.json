Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was actually speechless walking out of the movie theater.The Last Jedi gave me the same effect upon the second time viewing it. I can't remember the last movie that did that to me. I honestly don't think it's ever happened to me. I am a major fan of movies especially the Star Wars franchise. This is with no second thought my favorite Star Wars episode. No theories could have predicted what Rian Johnson did every few scenes. The movie was visually stunning and emotional. It opens with an amazing action sequence that shows how all the characters work together.  Go see it in the theater\\, you won't be disappointed.","true":true}
