Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The part where Lea comes back to the ship...the mutiny...the ship running out of gas (you're telling me the giant black triangle doesn't have smaller ships on it they could go blast that cruiser to smithereens?) rey and kylo loving each other then hating each other?????!!! This movie is a giant dumpster fire. Executive producer Kennedy should be fired.","true":true}
