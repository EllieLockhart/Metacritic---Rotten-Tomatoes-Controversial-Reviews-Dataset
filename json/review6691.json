Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't expect your typical Star Wars movie.  Sure\\, there are light saber battles aplenty and x-wings versus tie fighters (no spoilers here\\, right?)\\, but this movie is so much more!  Old characters remain\\, but they've changed\\, in ways that some viewers wouldn't have expected. Rey\\, Finn\\, and Kylo Ren are opened up as characters and show us more of who they really are\\, so view this movie on it's own and with a nod toward where the series is going. I do recommend watching The Force Awakens both before and after watching The Last Jedi\\, as both films and the characters within are viewed with much greater clarity and depth.","true":true}
