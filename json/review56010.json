Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sh***y Film. Destroys Luke Skywalker's character for no apparent reason. What is the point in Snoke and Captain Phasma? Why should we care? The actress who plays Rey has the emotional range and impact of a lump of wood. Her parents? Forget about it. An Incoherent plot full of holes. The most meaningful connection between any of the characters was between 'flyboy' and his robot BB-8. This movie fails in every instance where some kind of meaningful moment or content is required. Yoda sounded like a bad fortune cookie. Luke looks like he is battling a secret cough syrup addiction throughout the entire movie. Rey just inexplicably overcomes any obstacle without any real training. What was with that guy randomly licking a footprint? Just stupid. It seems like Poe's real job in the film was to learn to respect female leadership. Please leave PC nonsense out of entertainment. It just ruins everything.The only thing they got right were the animals. 0 stars! For wrecking the legacy of star wars. The critics are crazy!","true":true}
