{"101487":140612,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it's safe to say we're at prequel level for this trilogy. While the prequels had obvious major flaws\\, I did care about the stories of Qui Gon\\, Obi Wan\\, Mace and even Padme. However\\, I really couldn't care less about Rey or Poe\\, and I just feel sorry for John Boyega to have to work with such **** writing. The only character to step it up here was Kylo Ren\\, and that was mainly down to Driver really wringing the life out of what he had to work with. \\n\\nI also felt the really mishandled the Luke story\\, and Rey's training. They just spent the whole time arguing and not doing anything. Luke deserting his friends and family for *reasons* is totally out of character\\, and the only redeeming feature was the cool Jedi mind trick he did with Kylo\\, which I felt really set the scene for an epic confrontation in Ep.9.... Until they cut to him dying. With Carrie Fisher's unfortunate passing\\, this leaves us with half a dozen characters no one cares about to take on and defeat the Empire in Ep.9.... I think it's safe to say that at this point\\, most fans are hoping the Empire wins. \\n\\nOverall\\, this is more Justice League than Avengers. Finn and Rey are no more going to carry solo movies than Aquaman or Robotman\\, so I think Disney have a real problem moving forwards in creating interesting stories. Of course\\, a back story of how Kylo turned would have been cool\\, but that's a wash now with the amount of dumb exposition in the film - why did they even have to have three difference interpretations of the event? Just leave it to people's imagination and you then still have a potentially interesting thread to pick up at a later date. Imagine if during Obi Wan's \\\"he betrayed and murdered your father\\\" they had shown\\, rather than told. It basically nerfs one of the best reveals in movie history\\, and there is no angle for the prequels (ok\\, not necessary a bad thing....)\\n\\nOh yeah\\, and what happened to the Knights of Ren? I mean\\, I guess they could be holding them back for 9\\, but this movie really needed some more interesting angles set up for 9 and there would have been lots of potential threads they could have set up in this movie (Knights of Ren betraying Kylo; Luke had he lived turning some of them back to the light).","true":true}
