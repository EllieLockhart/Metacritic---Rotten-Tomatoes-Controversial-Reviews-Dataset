Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a terrible disappointment. I grew up watching movies 4\\,5 & 6 on video because my father grew up when these movies were released so being a true Star Wars fan this was a disappointment. What it comes down to is there were way too many stupid and pointless scenes and actions in the movie. It\u2019s plain and simple. There were too many things that were absolutely ridiculous. Honestly Disney don\u2019t try to change Star Wars into what you want. Stay true to the original three movies and then expand but do not change what they created for they are what Star Wars truly is.
