Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IF MICKEY MOUSE HIRED ME TO WRITE STAR WARS MOVIES - MY VERSION OF WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST JEDI AND WHERE IT SHOULD ALL END FOR ME A LIFE LONG STAR WARS FANATIC : SPOILERS BEWARE\\n\\nOK SHORT & SWEET - All Johnson had to do was tell us that Rey was the lost daughter of Luke's and her mother died tragically on the island (Luke standing at her grave in TFA) when Kylo & The Knights of Ren took the place down.

Snoke kills Leia in front of everyone and Luke saves everyone else by sacrificing himself with the most bad ass force move seen in any SW film. Rey & Kylo have it out - he realizes she is his cousin. Everyone watches it and Kylo pulls a fast move & escapes into space in his ship\\, followed by an injured Snoke and a few remaining bad guys.\\nROLL CREDITS EVERYONE CHEERS AND FREAKS OUT BRING ON IX!\\n\\nIX - 3 years pass - Rey\\, Finn & Poe reform the Rebellion with new blood\\, get a hint where Kylo & Snoke are hiding and then go after them.
