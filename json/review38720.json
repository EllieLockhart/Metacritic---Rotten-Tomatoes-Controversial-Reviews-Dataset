Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing is beyond awful\\, its like Rain Johnson has never seen a star wars movie. Luke was like a different character that makes  lame jokes. Most of the fight\/flying sequences looked good\\, there's many parts where people are exposed to space and are fine yet leia freezes in the same environment (just annoying). Any critic that likes this movie is paid off 100% or a moron. \\nTDLR: I created an account just to say this movie fucking blows. ZERO STARS!","true":true}
