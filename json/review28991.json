Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed the movie. Just not at all in the 'style' of the previous films\\, especially the original trilogy. Having reconciled myself to losing the entire saga created by the books\\, I have no problem digesting the new stuff.","true":true}
