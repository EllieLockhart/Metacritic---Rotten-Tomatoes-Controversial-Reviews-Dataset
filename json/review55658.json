Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh boy\\, what a disappointment. The first hour and a half of the movie was excellent\\, and set up for a huge finish...that never came. The first body blow the movie took was a decision by Laura Dern's character to NOT share information with the other leaders of the Resistance that made NO sense whatsoever. There was no reason at all for her to withhold it\\, yet she did.\\nTHEN\\, later in that same sequence\\, she does something that if she had done it about five minutes sooner\\, she could have saved hundreds of lives but she chose to wait because...it's more dramatic that way. HORRIBLE writing\\, LAZY writing.\\nThen\\, there's a scene where one of the characters is ready to sacrifice his life to save the others and another (horrible) character stops him because they don't want him to die...and gives some BS line about \\\"we won't win this war by killing the things we hate but saving the things we love.\\\" OK\\, fine but your idiocy could have just condemned all the REST of your friends to die.\\nAnd then...it just sort of ends. It feels like the end of the prequel trilogy\\, just an end to set up a new set of movies\\, but it's not\\, it's the second of three and they've left no logical place for the third movie to go except a huge time jump.\\nIt feels like Riann Johnson wrote himself into a corner and then had nowhere to go but someplace stupid and pointless. \\nWhat a horrible disappointment. I may not watch the third movie because poor JJ Abrams won't have any direction to take it to save it from the crappy mess Johnson left behind.","true":true}
