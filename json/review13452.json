Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed watching the movie\\, but I just did not like it. Most of the humor was stale and forced\\, Snoke should've been discovered more as a character\\, the space battles were slow and didn't make much sense\\, the addition of Rose and Admiral Holdo were not a good choice even though I loved Holdo's sacrifice scene\\, General Hux was turned from such a powerful and scary leader into a pathetic\\, powerless character for comedic relief\\, and Luke's character could've been better. I did love the visuals and certain scenes. Hopefully I'll like this movie better if 9 ties everything together\\, and Snoke\\, and Luke will return.","true":true}
