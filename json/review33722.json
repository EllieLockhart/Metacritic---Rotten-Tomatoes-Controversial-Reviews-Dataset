Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie just as a film on its own. Stop being fans boys and pretending this movie is good. Everything good about this film is null and void because it has no STORY!!! Flaws in films are easily forgivable when you have great story with highs and lows. This doesn\u2019t have that. Every great moment is undercut with jokes that seem completely out of place in Star Wars. Just sad \\, they could of had a great trilogy and it\u2019s ruined.","true":true}
