The second half of the game when you switch I absolutely loved this game and so did my whole family.

The second half of the game when you switch I absolutely loved this game and so did my whole family. This game became a family effect after the first 15 minutes.( had to pause some cutscenes and send the kids out a few times) As soon as I got home from work the family would start yelling for me to start the game so we could see what happens next Characters can really make you think about how you would have handled the actions of other people.  When I first started playing as the other character I was a little pissed and was wondering if this was naughty dogs way of making me feel bad for them.  After about an hour I was like **** it has worked\u201d and I was starting to really like them. I grew emotionally attached to the side characters during the second half more than the first half.  After beating this game and getting the platinum in it I haven\u2019t been able to play other games due to not being able to find a game that had the gameplay and story like this one did. With all the hate about the LGQBT stuff. Yes it is in there but it does not shove it down your throat.  It feels like it belongs and I felt it was done naturally and very well. Don\u2019t listen to all the haters out there who have nothing better to do but try to trash a masterpiece due to their own ignorance.   I highly recommend this game and suggest everyone keeps playing during the second half.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
