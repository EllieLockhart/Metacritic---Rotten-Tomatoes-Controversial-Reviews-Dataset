Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saying nothing of the disastrous mess of a narrative stretched thin by constant thread cycling between a plethora of irrelevant and disposable characters\\, The Last Jedi is so afraid of genuine emotional reflection that it remains painfully insincere from start to finish\\, constantly undermining and negating any honest feelings that might have been\\, and echoes hollow\\, cynical\\, and soulless. Shockingly\\, the literal worst Star Wars movie.","true":true}
