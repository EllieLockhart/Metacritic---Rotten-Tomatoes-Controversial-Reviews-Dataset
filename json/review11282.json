Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly think the writing is worse than the prequels\\, and this movie managed to kill all hype I had for the final film. Everything that hooked you into this film from the first movie either has zero pay off or is answered in the most bland unimaginative way possible. Much like the campaign of battlefront 2\\, this movie is pretty to look at but more shallow than a puddle and full of plot holes\\, shits on the lore\\, and everything feels like it only happened because the writers demanded it to be so. You'll have to bring some major fan goggles to accept anything that happens in this film being remotely believable\\, this is Saturday morning cartoons levels of convenience.","true":true}
