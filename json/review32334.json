Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has to be built for international audiences now\\, and to appeal to younger demographics as well with Disney at the helm. This has led to a film that's superfluous and visually-flashy\\, and lacking the philosophical depths and chemistry of the originals that made them so romantic.\\n\\nAside from a richer dynamic between Kylo and Rey\\, if not a bit of a re-hash of Return and Empire\\, the rest of the main characters are asides that operate in familiar roles from the Star Wars series\\, but more shallowly\\, and newer characters attempt to relate to the audience as everymen\\, because Rey and Kylo certainly can't. We learn that Rey's parents aren't special\\, somehow making her even blander than the desert she's from\\, and we learn that Kylo was betrayed Luke\\, who saw glimpses of the darkness in him. Immediately afterward\\, were told\\, Kylo goes on a psycho murdering spree\\, and somehow convinces the Jedi apprentices who survive it to follow him instead of Luke.\\n\\nPoe \\\"I like him\\\" Dameron is resigned to the cockpit\\, when he's not wound up in pointless dialogue. No adventures with Finn or any bromance found here. He does say hello to Rey for the first time at the very end\\, so there's that. Rey and Finn are only in that scene together\\, too\\, and don't speak to each other in it.\\n\\nWhat can even be said about the new Emperor? He's dead\\,\u00a0 along with Capt. Phasma\\, not that anything happens on-screen either with this otherwise shiny character before she's killed off..\u00a0\\n\\nMark Hamill's and Carrie Fisher's performances were stellar\\, but Disney's vision for their characters is crude\\, and disrespectful to the Star Wars legacy. Luke\\, the hero of the original trilogy\\, is a sacred cow that many fans were excited to see actually do something on-screen after his Force Awakens cameo. Instead\\, he spends most of the film resisting doing anything at all\\, other than milking sea cows\\, especially not developing any relationship with Rey\\, the main character who's supposed to carry on the Jedi legacy. Then he's killed off\\, like a fart in the wind. Fans will speculate as to why he had to die but I don't expect an explanation for anything at this point.\\n\\nI've never left a Star Wars film genuinely disappointed\\, but the legacy of my childhood is betrayed in The Last Jedi. The Star Wars mantle belongs entirely now to characters that seem to understand little of the past they've inherited\\, and have no chemistry together on-screen. As fans\\, we hardly know more about them than we did in the first film. \\n\\nOur hero\\, Rey\\, but also the seemingly all-powerful villain and Supreme Leader Snoke\\, it feels like we know even less about\\, after being left with major cliffhangers about their identities from the first film that had pitiful resolutions in this one. I won't be left thinking about anything in this film\\, other than how Rey learned how to fight with a lightsaber- and speak Wookie.","true":true}
