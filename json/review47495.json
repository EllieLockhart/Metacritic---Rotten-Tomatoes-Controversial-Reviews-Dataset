Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is worse the humor\\, Leai can all of a sudden work the force\\,  or the knock off of the anime series\\, where the dark side is male and the light is female? No originality\\, no true plot\\, a botched job of what Star Wars truly is. Come back George\\, Disney has botched it again.","true":true}
