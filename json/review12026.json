Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie\\, I really enjoyed pretty much everything that I saw in it. The scenery was incredible\\, all of the planets\\, the creatures\\, the action\\, it was incredible. The drama was great\\, I enjoyed the interplay between the characters\\, the nostalgia\\, the ending was very good\\, and it got me interested in seeing Episode IX\\, I will definitely see this movie again!","true":true}
