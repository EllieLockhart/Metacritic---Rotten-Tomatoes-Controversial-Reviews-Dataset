Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. I loved Star Wars and this is the worst episode yet. I'd rather watch 15 minutes of Jar Jar Binks. This movie has made me lose all faith whatsoever in Rotten Tomatoes. The \\\"critics\\\" are must be paid shills. Anyone who likes this movie and who isn't under the age of 12 should be lobotomized.","true":true}
