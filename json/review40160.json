Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not only the worst Star wars movie ever\\, but is one of the worst movies i've ever seen period.  The story is just bad and the plot is just pointless.  Star wars is ruined forever and I will never watch another new movie as long as Kathleen Kennedy is in charge.","true":true}
