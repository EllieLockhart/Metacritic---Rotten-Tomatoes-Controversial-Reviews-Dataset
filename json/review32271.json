Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans are like weezer fans. They want more and new but when the get it\\, they are dissatisfied with what is presented\\, they want what what they are nostalgic for but not a rescripting of old films. But they don\u2019t want anything that will challenge their understanding of what they expect. The film was well presented and loved characters filled their rolls. When new aspects are presented we should be grateful that our old friends appear\\, but also be engaged when the characters evolve and change. The character arch is what makes a story worth engaging.
