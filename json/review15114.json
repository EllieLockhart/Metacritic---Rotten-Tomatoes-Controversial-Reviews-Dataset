Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked every single star wars movie but this one just was anticlamactic\\, ruined every mystery\\, and turned the force into something really boring somehow. It was a long movie but very little happened. No cool aliens or alien worlds\\, no sense in the decisions of some characters\\, pointless scenes\\, and felt low budget for a star wars movie. Whoever is praising it must have been paid. This movie was a disappointment.","true":true}
