{"101487":193107,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waaay TOO MUCH forced Comedy that was cringe worthy! TLJ abandons everything that is a Star Wars film. Kylo Ren even said to forget the Jedi\\, forget the Sith\\, forget the Empire and the First Order. Basically Forget everything that made Star Wars ... Star Wars!! Then start it over. Luke Skywalker deserved better! His character arc made no sense at all. The whole Casino \\\"code breaker\\\" part was FILLER. Snoke was wasted and Captain Phasma also wasted (she could have been a Badass villain\\, but she loses to wimp\/ chickenhearted Fin). TFA promised us the start of an exciting new trilogy\\, but TLJ fizzled out. What a Dud \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was. Too many Disney\/ Marvel elements made their way into this movie TLJ. Critics must have received a generous amount of payola money $$$ to give Last Jedi Positive reviews!! SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF WALT DISNEY!!! SW Fans deserved better than TLJ!!!","true":true}
