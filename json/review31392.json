Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some massive (but fixable in IX) plot holes and mistreatment of Luke. Also a terrible character in Rose (and no\\, not for racist or misogynistic reasons). Still has it's epic Star Wars moments but contains some of the biggest missteps in the franchise. Could look better in retrospect if some plot holes are fixed in IX or comics or tv shows.","true":true}
