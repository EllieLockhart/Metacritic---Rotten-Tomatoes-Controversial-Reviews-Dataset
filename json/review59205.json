How a main character\\, so smart to have survived 25 years simply gets inside a house full of strangers with his same experienced veteran brother\\, both give out their names. Explain why we played as Abby half of the game when all we wanted was see her suffer. Explain how the game could have ended at peace but ellie decides to go after her again (thankfully)\\, yet when she is just about to kill her finally\\, she has a stupid flashback of Joel (what makes me mad is that another flashback made her go after Abby again)and decides to spare her. In the end\\, ellie lost everyone\\, 2 fingers\\, didn't get revenge\\, but Abby got her revenge and got a happy ending with Lev. Wasn't this game abou Ellie's revenge? Didn't you want Ellie to get revenge? Who gives 2 **** about Abby honestly. **** that trash game. Neil **** and his stupid \\\"deep\\\" meaning ideas. If the game solely consisted of Flashbacks of Joel and Ellie like those from the museum\\, it would have been a masterpiece. For me this game shouldn't have existed\\, it all have ended in the first game. Period.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
