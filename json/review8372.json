Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like something i loved has been ripped from me.  I am very angry after having it sink in for 12 hours and getting angrier by the minute.  There are some things to like\\, but a lot to complain about.\\nI felt like Poe was just given random screen time and I ended up hating his character.  Finn had slightly better things to do.  The Rey-Kylo-Luke story is intriguing but the choices just left me upset.  Hopefully it is better upon second viewing but I have no idea what there is to do in Episode 9.","true":true}
