Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adorei a historia\\, me cativou a personagem Rose e Finn\\, mas o \u00fanico coisa que me desgradou nesse filme\\, foi a longa fuga e alguns furo de roteiro\\, creio que a culpa disso foi a divis\u00e3o de dire\u00e7\u00e3o entre JJ Abram e Rian Johnson.","true":false}
