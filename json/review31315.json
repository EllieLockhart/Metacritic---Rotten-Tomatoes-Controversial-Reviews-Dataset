Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some fans forget that Star Wars is about the Skywalker family. Not just Luke. Spoiler warning here but the movie ends with Skywaker relatives in very intetesting positions. Second of all as the 2nd act it  is a darker low for the good guys. They saw failure after failure through the whole movie with worst results each time. It is comparable to ep 5 (as it should be).","true":true}
