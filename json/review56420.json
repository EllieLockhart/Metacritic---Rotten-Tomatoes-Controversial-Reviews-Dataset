Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best one of the sequel trilogy.  Surprising\\, emotional\\, great action and amazing tone.  I can see where you're coming from\\, if you didn't like Luke in the movie\\, but it wasn't a problem for me.  Just sad it got destroyed by the big fans\\, because let me tell you\\, the critics and the casual fans adored it.","true":true}
