Worse still\\, we were sold a false bill of goods. Every advert we saw and every word out of Naughty Dog's mouth told us that we would be going on another journey with Ellie and Joel. We did no such thing. Instead we were treated to Ellie and Joel being brutalized and tossed aside so that Naughty Dog could force upon us a new protagonist that none of us wanted or cared about. The utter contempt with which Naughty Dog treated its own beloved characters and the dishonest way in which they've dealt with the fandom override any and all of the good qualities this game has. What score could I possibly give a game that seemingly exists for no other reason than to trash what I love and spit in my face except zero? (Note that I was forced to give it at least a 1 because the website has decided not to permit reviews giving the game a zero despite zero being an option)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
