Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was practically raised by being fed almost nothing but Star Wars. I've seen all the movies and every last episode of the Clone Wars TV series. But I've never been more disappointed by someone or something that I love so much. After seeing The Force Awakens in theaters in 2015\\, I left that theater with so many questions that I thought would either be answered or played upon in episode 8\\, seeing as how much of an effect things like Rey's Parents or Kylo's turn to the darkside had in episode 7. Instead\\, I'm given a complete redirection from the Force Awakens from a narrative standpoint. There are plot inconsistencies\\, so much thrown away potential\\, and incredibly dumb and forced humor in scenes that should have been more important which stoops down\\, if not sinking below\\, the kind of bad humor in Marvel Superhero movies. The two actual fight scenes in episode 8 were dissatisfying. I would go into detail but that would be spoiling the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it. There were some scenes that were played off as fight scenes\\, but were really just one team pelting another with everything they had. The most interesting villains were pretty much killed off\\, and the movie itself left off in the worst of ways\\, with the stupidly few remaining rebels hiding in the equivalent of a supersized dumpster with guns\\, and the first order making the slowest of slow and anticlimactic advances. There is also no character development and the existence of countless characters that would make the movie better by not existing in the first place.","true":true}
