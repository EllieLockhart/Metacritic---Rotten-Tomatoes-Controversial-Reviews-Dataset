Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment. I'm politically progressive and understand the need for some strong\\, wise women characters\\, but these characters need well written story arcs\\, as well as some strong\\, wise male characters to interact with. That's good storytelling that reflects real life and real equality. Princess Leia in the original series was an quality\\, inspiring character as well as her equally good male characters who went through the adventure with her. Now\\, all the men are stupid\\, cowardly\\, hot headed\\, or clownish. Rey needed some serious obstacles to overcome and time to develop her powers. I'm also not down with what they did with Luke's character. I sadly have to let go now. I'm not mad\\, just incredibly disappointed. They expressed the inherited wisdom of Star Wars in a very distorted\\, dishonest  way that doesn't serve the greater good. Goodbye Star Wars. It is now clear to me that it now ended with the Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
