Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke warm film. Too many bad bad moments to be regarded as a good film. That's not too say there was not good moments. It's watchable but somehow feels superficial. Most of the story arcs reach an unfulfilling end. The conclusion to all the plots are usually totally unplausable or poposterous. A CGI mess or a completely lucky escape. Their is usually not talent or intelligence behind the way situations resolve. It all takes a leap of imagination. Alot of cheese moments. Untimely hollow  deaths.Best part is the humour. Very good. Genuinely funny.","true":true}
