Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Star Wars film for people who like cinema. If you are a Star Wars purist who knows nothing of real cinema and live vicariously through the predictable trilogies then sure you will not like this film. But if you actually like movies for what they are\\, cinema\\, then you will love the film. ","true":true}
