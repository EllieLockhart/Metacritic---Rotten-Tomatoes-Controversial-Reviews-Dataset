Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take the scene where the rebels escape Hoth and make a complete waste of a movie about how they didn't get away. Walks you get The Last Jedi!! Honestly made a movie from one whole scene!  Spoiler- There are truly no more Jedi or Sith anymore.","true":true}
