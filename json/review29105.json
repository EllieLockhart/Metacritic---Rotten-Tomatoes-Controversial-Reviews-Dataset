Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really\\, really BAD movie. This is a huge slap in the face to Star Wars fans. It has very little continuity with the original films or The Force Awakens. The plot is boring and riddled with holes. The actors do their best\\, but you have to wonder if they were shaking their heads after delivering their lines. It is rightly called The Last Jedi because it is unclear if the franchise can continue after this travesty.","true":true}
