Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey becoming a jedi master with 5 minutes of training? Lame.  THe first use of hyperspeed weapons? Lame. A Character falling in love with someone they met 6 hours earlier and had 0 romantic interaction with? Lame.  The admiral not telling anyone her plan for no reason whatsoever and inciting a mutiny and shooting people over it? Lame.  The purpose of large vessels being there is no purpose\\, Lame.  Poe being a god. Lame","true":true}
