Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film of all time\\, and perhaps on a budget to quality ratio\\, the worst movie of all time is filled with feminist propaganda\\, leftist indoctrination and insults the audience with their constant patronising. Astute movie goers should stay away from this garbage.","true":true}
