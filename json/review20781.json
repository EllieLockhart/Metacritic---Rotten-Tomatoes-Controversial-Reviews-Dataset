Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie so much but from the first cringe inducing opening scene\\, this film is a complete disaster. More importantly (and what's led me to write my first ever review) is the obvious Disney influence on mainstream reviewers. The number of 4\/5 ratings this film received is indicative of major press titles (and websites) not wanting to antagonise a major ad revenue source. Disney will try to point towards not bein able to please mega fans\\, the agenda in certain sections of society against some of the progressive messages within the film and the fact that The Last Jedi is one of the biggest box office films ever as vindication for negatives fan reviews. In reality The Last Jedi is the worst kind of film\\, a newly acquired franchise that takes a film saga rich in complexity and lobotomises it to sell Porgs and secret rebel rings to 10 year olds.","true":true}
