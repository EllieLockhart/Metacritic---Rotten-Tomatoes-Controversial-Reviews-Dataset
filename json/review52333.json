Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie with some serious problems. There are a lot of moving parts in the movie that don't make much sense at all when you barely scratch the surface. One of the biggest conflicts and plot points in the movie (basically the entire predicament the Resistance is in) could be solved so easily if a couple characters didn't act ridiculous.  There are some great moments and moments that left you wanting. Definitely not near Empire Strikes Back level\\, and DEFINITELY not the best since Empire like I've seen some critics say. I'd put Return of the Jedi\\, Revenge of the Sith\\, and Rogue One ahead of it in terms of Star Wars movies that have come out since Episode V\\, and there are elements of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones that I like better\\, though I would acknowledge that as films they aren't as well made as The Last Jedi. It's about on pat with Force Awakens which I'm not the biggest fan of. It's a good movie that could've been much MUCH better.","true":true}
