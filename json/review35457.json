Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi Director and writer Rian Johnson definitely took some risks with the middle chapter of the Star Wars Sequel trilogy.  Upon first viewing - I had a somewhat mixed reaction.  Upon 2nd viewing\\, my definite response - The Movie is awesome! Great Performances pretty much across the board.  More humor than expected\\, most of which lands well.  One VERY poignant scene which I won't spoil. Looking forward to Solo\\,  and Episode 9!","true":true}
