Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst film of the series\\, TFA is a close second. It's sad that 7 and 8 make Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones look like decent films. I wish I could wipe these movies from my memory.","true":true}
