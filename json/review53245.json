Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant movie that further develops the new characters\\, loads of shocks\\, twists and some brutal moments. The action is always top notch and some secrets are revealed\\, by the end of this chapter there is hope of a new generation of movies still to come. The force is explained well and the conflict with the dark side and the light is also handled well. The only reason why this chapter may not be the best in the series is due to some scenes that did not work for me. This movie may divide some fans in the handling of the original characters but I am definitely excited to see how this trilogy plays out in 2 years time. A must watch for sure!","true":true}
