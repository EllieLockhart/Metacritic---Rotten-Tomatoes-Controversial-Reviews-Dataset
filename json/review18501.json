Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is rare that a movie sequel can ruin the movie that sparked the franchise\\, but it can happen.  Anyone who doubts this should watch the Matrix trilogy.  The Last Jedi completely destroyed 40 years of movie and cultural mythology.  Critics love it because they HATED the original trilogy.  We sat through the prequels to find out how Anikin became Darth Vader.  We were not disappointed with the final battle and ending.  Nothing similar can be said for the Last Jedi.  It takes the galaxy invented by George Lucas and turns it inside out and upside down.  If you HATE the original 3 movies you might like this episode.  If you want to see a movie written by a couple of millennials who didn't take the time to study the original movies and instead read the plot summaries\\, watch this movie.  Otherwise\\, don't ruin the originals (or even the prequals) with this ridiculous  sham.  Mark Hammil should have let someone else ruin Luke's legacy.","true":true}
