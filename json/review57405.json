Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a devastating embarrassment on nearly every level. Every part of the movie had serious problems\\, but let me point to the absolute worst moment in the film\\, a single line: \\\"Someone has to stay behind to pilot the ship.\\\" When Holdo says this\\, it flies in the face of every moment of Star Wars back to the very first minute of episode IV with Leia trusting R2-D2 to find Obi-Wan. Where's the autopilot? Why is Holdo being sacrificed in such a blatantly nonsensical manner? Why is the plot relying on absurd mechanics at every step of the way? Did the director have the foggiest clue of what machines can do in this universe? Heck\\, a ship is really just a big droid\\, and Ron Howard mocked Rian Johnson in Solo by literally putting the droid L-3 into the Falcon. Moments like this that smack viewers with how wrong they are occur over and over\\, resulting in an offensive\\, degrading moviegoing experience.","true":true}
