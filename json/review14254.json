Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore audience critics who are reacting\\, not so much to actual flaws in the movie (though there are some)\\, but to their own anger at plot points they didn't like or expect.  Just go see it.  Not all questions are answered\\, some seem to be but may not be what we think\\, but that's why this is #2 in a trilogy.  Great movie\\, worthy Star Wars entry.","true":true}
