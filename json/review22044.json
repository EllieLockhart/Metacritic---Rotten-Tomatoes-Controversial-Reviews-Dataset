Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy has destroyed the franchise. No just Last Jedi was Last Star Wars. But Disney does good to pay a lot of money to the Critics. Horrible Movie.","true":true}
