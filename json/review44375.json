Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plots holes. Immature jokes too often ruined the tone and delivery of key scenes. Leia Poppins flying through space takes jumping the shark to a new level\\, I lost interest in the new trilogy immediately upon seeing this\\, it looked terrible on screen. TLJ is jarringly disconnected from what the Force Awakens set up. Rain's take on Luke Skywalker is selfish and ridiculous. On positive\\, TLJ has great visuals\\, cool planets and space scenes but unfortunately all these scenes are undermined by incredible plots holes and out of place\\, teenage jokes. Snoke\\, Phasma\\, and Chewie all wasted characters. Side stories with Poe and Finn do not make sense and boring. I am still in disbelief with where Rain took this movie and have lost interest in the Star Wars series at large due to TLJ.","true":true}
