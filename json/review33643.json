Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, \\\"Kill the Past\\\" the main theme in the movie is also the biggest issue\\, it's a movie that wants to do something new\\, while trying to destroy everything it was build on.  I think the best way to describe it is\\, trying to build a sky scrapper using it's own foundations as the building material.  All it adds up to is a demolition of failure that destroys what it stood on\\, having the movie fall on it's face without anything to stand on.","true":true}
