Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes all the things that could have been interesting from The Force Awakens and throws them away because the director thought being subversive was a substitute for good writing.  The character of Luke Skywalker is completely destroyed and stays that way until the plot needs him to help again.  The entire Holdo scene is really stupid because one moment Holdo is shown as an incompetent leader that is going to get everyone killed because of her plan then the movie expects the audience to just except that she is now a hero.  The \\\"Holdo Maneuver\\\" completely breaks space battles for the rest of enternaty and is only used because of lazy writing.  Rey randomly becoming an expert lightsaber duelist is really odd due to her only training being randomly swinging a lightsaber at a rock.  Though you can tell that a movie is bad if it makes people rewatch the prequels because they didn't remember them being this much of a dumpster fire.","true":true}
