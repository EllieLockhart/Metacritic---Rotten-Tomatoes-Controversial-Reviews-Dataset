Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not even sure where to start with this insipid flick\\, which is reminiscent of teenage fanfic. While I was excited to see a new story and a new direction for Star Wars\\, this wasn't it. While the visuals were superb\\, the story was atrocious\\, acting lackluster\\, plot was horrendous and honestly it was terrible all-around. The Force Awakens set up something that could have been a good story but now I doubt I'll see any of the coming slew of these. It was that bad.","true":true}
