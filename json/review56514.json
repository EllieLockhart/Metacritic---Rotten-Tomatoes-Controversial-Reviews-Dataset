Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The GOOD\\nThis movie gives a huge middle finger to Force Awakens\\, and basically either ignores or trashes everything \\\"set up\\\" about any of the characters introduced in Force Awakens\\, and doesn't seek to close any of the mind-bending plot-holes that FA introduced.\\n\\nThe BAD\\nThe directors are still doing a LOUSY job of providing exits for the \\\"old guard\\\"\\, in that they are all either reduced to bit parts\\, background furniture\\, or just lingering on in meaningless roles.\\n\\nThe characters that do survive are completely changed from who they were or what they represented\\, and everything that they accomplished in the first two trilogies has been reduced to nothing. Basically\\, what they did in the first six movies was meaningless.\\n\\nThis was not really Star Wars ... the space battles sucked big time\\, the light-sabre duels were dumb\\, and there was NOTHING to compare to the great duels with Darth Maul\\, Count Duku\\, General Grievous\\, Sidious\\, or Obi-Wan vs Darth Anakin. (I am not a fan of the Prequels\\, but they did at least feel like Star Wars).\\n\\nBesides Rey\\, Finn and Ben Solo (Kylo Ren)\\, no new meaningful characters exist\\, there is no interesting new alien or non-white characters. None. Zero. The aliens are just background scenery with no lines\\, or story arcs. Even a Jar Jar might have been welcome. (Okay\\, no.).","true":true}
