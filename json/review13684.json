Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I had not grown up watching Star Wars Episodes 4\\, 5 & 6\\, I would have thought this movie was great. But I did watch the old movies\\, and so this movie was not great. It was far from it. It took a character that I looked up to\\, as a childhood hero\\, and turned him into a joke\/villain. This is hugely disappointing. They killed off Luke in this movie\\, but to me\\, he died back in '83 with Return of the Jedi. The man in this movie is not Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
