Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was phenomenal. I've been a star wars fan all these years\\, and I know when I saw this movie\\, a future star wars master piece was being produced. I've seen many comments about 'trying to be too diverse' or 'too many women' but lets get these rude and disgusting comments removed from these reviews\\, because if you think star wars and the world that was built was meant for regular north american white guys\\, then I would suggest that you look around and see all the alien species including biths and ewoks\\, to understand that diversity is a key element in the star wars world\\, because its meant to include the very diverse group of people that watched it as a kid\\, often people who did not feel like they belonged. This movie brought people from around the world\\, and it showed elements of the past and future. In order for Star Wars to continue\\, the reliance of the sky walker blood must be terminated. I always wanted to be a jedi\\, but I always thought I could never be the best because I wasnt a skywalker (and I wasnt in the star wars world) but to get the best characters\\, story lines and a new developing star wars world\\, we have to let go of the past. So kuudos to the creators\\, actors and everyone else involved in this movie\\, you have brought a great movie that will change the course of the franchise to a better much needed direction.","true":true}
