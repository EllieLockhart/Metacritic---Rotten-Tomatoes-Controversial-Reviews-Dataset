Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I had never seen a Star Wars film in my life\\, I might have actually enjoyed this movie. As it is\\, this movie disappointed in several aspects. My first issue is with the direction that the director decided to go with Luke's personality. In the original (1970s\/80s) trilogy\\, Luke is the only character who sees the internal conflict\\, and potential for redemption\\, of the (arguably) main antagonist\\, Darth Vader. Against the advice of all other characters\\, he approaches Vader\\, and gives him a chance to redeem himself. Fast forward to this new trilogy\\, and Luke now sees similar conflict in one of his pupils. Arguably\\, this pupil is far less evil than Vader\\, at the time\\, thus making any thoughtful individual suppose that he should act in a similar manner\\, as he did with Vader; see the good in the pupil\\, and give them a chance to prove himself\\, as did Vader. Instead\\, Luke's personality takes a complete 180\u00b0 turn\\, and he decides that he should kill his conflicted student\\, without giving him a chance. \\n\\nOther things that were bothersome were the killing of Snoke\\, which was fine\\, in and of itself\\, but it killed the audience's expectations of exposition of where he came from. \\n\\nLeia learned how to fly\\, and apparently can survive the vacuum of space.  Fin goes on a mission that is reminiscent of a bad side mission in a low budget videogame.","true":true}
