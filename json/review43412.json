Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an OK movie\\, not a great Star Wars movie. I walked away very \\\"meh\\\" from it. There were beautiful moments followed by boring\\, uninspired ones. Finn's entire arc and time was a waste of space. Poe was interesting at the start but then repetitive\\, derivative and nonsensical at points. I will just state plainly I didn't like where they took Luke but I get it. He was always a whiny hesitant character and Yoda told him in Empire that if he left his training to save his friends it ultimately wouldn't be the right course. Yoda took that full circle so while I didn't like it\\, it made sense. Rey and Kylo were both interesting. Superman Leia was too much for me. I just couldn't buy it and thought that it was unnecessary. I didnt't get A \\\"oh look she is using the Force\\\" happy feeling. I got a \\\"dear God no they aren't going to.... yeah they went there\\, ouch\\\" feeling.","true":true}
