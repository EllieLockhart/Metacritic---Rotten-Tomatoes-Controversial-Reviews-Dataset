Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute desecration of Luke Skywalker occurs in this film. It oozes of Rian Johnson's arrogance and misguided motivation to 'surprise' viewers\\, while being 'true to himself'. Luke is reduced to an imasculated old fart\\, who lacks wisdom\\, character\\, and has grown in fanaticism. He is made a joke. He is made to be laughed at by smug and intellectually enlightened leftists. The self redemption of Luke in the end is so underwhelming. This film tries to befriend you with the intention of pulling down your pants and pushing you over on the ground as the surrounding mob cackles and points. \\n\\nAs Lucas said on Charlie Rose\\, \\\"It's a space soap opera\\\".\\n\\nThere is absolutely no explanation for most of the sensational plot twists Rian throws at the audience.  The incredible power of Rey supercedes Yoda and all Jedis before her\\, who trained an entire lifetime to earn such wisdom\\, character\\, and ability with the force. The death of Snoke with absolutely zero character development is a joke. \\n\\nWhile there are some very entertaining scenes and the production value is phenomenal\\, as we'd expect\\, Rian Johnson urinates on the fanbase who so cherished and supported the franchise. He scoffs and laughs at the genuine sadness of fans who embraced the classic mythology and story telling inspired in large by Joseph Campbell and realized by Lucas.","true":true}
