Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely brilliant. The characters even spell out for the fans that Star Wars is no longer just about the it won't go as expected. Probably a little too much going on\\, but I'm guessing it has the future in mind too.","true":true}
