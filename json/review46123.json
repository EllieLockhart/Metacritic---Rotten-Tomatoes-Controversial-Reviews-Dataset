Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visualmente es entretenida pero rompe con la atmosfera de nostalgia y novedad que se le dio en la pelicula anterior y parece sufrir del famoso \\\"capricho de director\\\"\\, aquellas escenas o partes del gui\u00f3n que se meten a la trama sin explicaci\u00f3n alguna.","true":false}
