Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a safe ripoff of A New Hope.  I was able to forgive Han's demise because that's probably what Harrison would have preferred and at lease his character went down as a hero.  \\n\\nThe Last Jedi goes out of its way to screw everything that came before it.  It's so bad that I can't even enjoy the original trilogy anymore.  Thanks for taking that away from me.\\n\\nCongratulations\\, Ruin","true":true}
