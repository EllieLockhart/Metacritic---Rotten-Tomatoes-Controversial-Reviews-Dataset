Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was in 3rd grade. I will likely be in the minority for my opinion. I did not like \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d It is sad for me to say that but I did not leave impressed with the movie. It had way to many pointless scenes and characters. For the most part the acting was god awful! Additionally\\, this movie has more plot holes than Louisiana has pot holes. It could have been a great movie if they cut out 30-45 mins of the middle. Also\\, do not watch in 3D. With that said Mark Hamill should when an oscar. He did a great job bringing back Luke Skywalker. Finally RIP again Carrie Fisher! You will be missed. In Conclusion\\, this movie imo is the worst in the saga. Disney really needs to recalculate or it will lose fans.","true":true}
