Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok we get it...you thought the jokes were cheesy and Leah flying through space wasn?t believable. But plot? Cmon episode 4 was in a garbage bin. Please. This film is beautiful and fun. It?s why people go to movies. Don?t be so critical that you miss the beauty.","true":true}
