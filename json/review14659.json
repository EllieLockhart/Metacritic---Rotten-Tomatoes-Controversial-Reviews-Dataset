Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have mixed feelings about The Last Jedi. While it delivers on the action\\, feeling and a great send off to both Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill's characters\\, many moments in the film seem completely out of place or unnecessary. The underlying story seems deep with promise but plot twist just don't deliver and at times can be confusing.","true":true}
