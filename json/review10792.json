Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie to date. Rian Johnson had his SJW ways in full display here and it shows. Everything that was set up in TFA was completely dismantled and thrown in the dumpster. A very low point for the Star Wars series. We can only hope that JJ can come back and save face a little bit in the third installment because he is already fighting an uphill battle. This movie will surely be debated for decades to come.","true":true}
