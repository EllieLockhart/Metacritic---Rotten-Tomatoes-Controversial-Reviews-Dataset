Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. It wasn't a perfect movie by any means. Poe  is my least favorite character he could be removed and i don't think he would be missed to much. Also there were parts of the movie that seemed like they didn't really amount to much. With that said i loved what they did with Luke it made him so much more interesting and realistic. People are disappointed but after 50 years of fighting watching friends and loved ones die learning your father was Vader would have that effect on you. One of the greatest parts was watching Luke not only pull off the most powerful force display we have ever seen but in watching Luke except his failures and peacefully become one with the force thus ending his \\\"physical existence\\\" . Just quickly let me touch on the internet bashing brigade.  You can certainly have your own opinions but\\, a large majority of the hate for this movie is from the internet \\\"detectives\\\" who spent two years trying to figure out who Ray's parents where and who Snoke was just to have it shown that it doesn't matter! Ray's parents being nobodies is the point! You don't have to be some divine force being or a Skywalker to be an important person.","true":true}
