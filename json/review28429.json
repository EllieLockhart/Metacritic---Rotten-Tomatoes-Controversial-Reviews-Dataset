{"101487":162981,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretending this movie isn't bad doesn't help anyone\\n\\nIt's okay to like it. But please don't dismiss any criticism from anyone who didn't. It's not helping anyone\\, especially not the filmmakers who need to get some feedback. Because when you look at it from up close\\, this movie has some serious writing issues. \\n\\nSpoilers ahead\\, but first\\, a word about the backlash.\\nA lot of people (including from interviews I read\\, the filmmakers themselves) seem to think the reason others didn't like the film was that they were disappointed by the events in it. That we didn't like the surprises. That we're just complaining because what we thought would happen didn't. This isn't true. It isn't why we didn't think the film was good.\\nI hope this review can help you understand us.\\n\\n1- Luke\\n\\nFrom the start\\, this film has a very hard job to do. Justifying Luke deserting the galaxy when it needed him most (something that was already a problem in Force Awakens). \\n\\nI have no issue with a dishearten and broken Luke. I like that idea very much actually. So why wasn't I satisfied by what happened on screen?\\n\\nThe problem with the backstory provided by The Last Jedi to explain Luke's current state is that it doesn't match his already established character arc.\\nYou probably heard that before\\, and maybe you shrugged it off saying \\\"anyone can fail\\, it's actually better if he's human and fails\\\". To which I would reply : Luke's character arc doesn't mean Luke cannot fail\\, it means Luke cannot fail the way it is described in The Last Jedi. Not without a lot more than two flashbacks to back it up.\\n\\nTo understand this\\, let's consider Luke's character arc\\, not only over the Original Trilogy\\, but over the Prequels as well. Now; it's true\\, Luke isn't in the prequels; and even truer\\, the prequels are bad.\\n\\nBut the one important idea the prequels establish is this: The Jedi are wrong. Right from episode one\\, the Jedi's views are wrong. By pushing Anakin to bottle up his feelings instead of dealing with them\\, they participate to his turn to the dark side even more than the emperor did. \\nWhen we reach the beginning of Return of The Jedi\\, the Jedi are still wrong. Both Obi-wan and Yoda\\, the two masters and mentors\\, want Luke to kill his father as they see no redemption possible in him.\\nWhen Luke refuses to kill Vader at the end of Return of The Jedi and throws his saber away\\, we could argue it is the first time we actually see a proper Jedi on screen. He becomes what the Jedi forgot they should be.\\nThe prequels have that one thing going for them that they make Luke's choice at the end of the saga echo further back in time. The Jedi aren't returning from 3 films of absence. They're returning from 6. They were never truly there. Luke brings them back to the ideal they should be.\\n\\nLuke's arc to that decision took 3 films of journey\\, plus 3 more films of crafting mentors that would fight against his decision and make it even harder for him to stick to it. That's what I call a pretty freaking solid story arc.\\n\\nTrying to bend said arc with only two 10 seconds flashbacks doesn't work. It's undeserved and doesn't ring true.\\n\\nFor those still arguing \\\"Yes but he's human\\, human fails. Wouldn't you prefer to see Luke as a human with flaws that can make mistakes rather than as an unfailing wise old man?\\\" and my answer is yes of course. Of course Luke can fail and is more interesting if he does\\, and of course I want to see that.\\n\\nBut this is a story. To believe in a character\\, they have be consistent. Not unfailing\\, but consistent. The way Luke fails in The Last Jedi isn't specific to him\\, it's random. It doesn't come out of his own personal flaws but from the keyboard of a screenwriter needing him to fail.\\n \\nLet me give you an example of a way to turn Luke into the same bitter and dishearten old man but with a series of events and actions that matches his character. Let's say that Luke\\, while training Ben Solo\\, noticed his student was turning to the dark side but didn't act upon it\\, believing (as it would be consistent for him to) that the good in people would prevail. And if\\, as a consequence to that non action\\, Luke thought himself responsible for all the people Ben Killed once Ben completed his turn\\, THEN Luke would have really failed.\\nNot just a momentary lapse coming out of nowhere\\, but the collapse of the core foundation of his character's beliefs. Which one do you think would be more powerful?\\nIf this had been the backstory offered to me\\, then I would believe that he gives up on himself and goes into exile. Because that failure would make sense with his arc.\\n\\nAnd if you tell me \\\"but then\\, why DID Ben Solo turn to the dark side? You need to explain that one too\\, and your suggestion doesn't address that.\\\" I would answer: The Last Jedi evades that question as well. There's no reason Ben being attacked by Luke should turn him evil. If anything\\, it would convince him of Luke being evil and push him to be better. The backstory the film describes evades the turn of Ben Solo by providing a non answer to that question.\\n\\nNow\\, on that subject\\, my turn.\\nWouldn't you like to see Rey as a human who can fail? Or any of the other new characters for that matter? In this new installment (and new series overall)\\, there is never any real defeat for the heroes. Yes\\, they loose crew\\, but no one we either knew or that didn't voluntary sacrificed themselves\\, so that when the survivors escape it doesn't feel like they suffered a defeat (certainly no bigger than losing a whole system of planets in the last film).\\nPoe was the only character close to going through a journey in this film. But he doesn't fail enough and isn't punished enough for failing\\, and so his journey causes no real change to his character. Him repeating Laura Dern's line at the end tries to fill in for that gap and mimic a change we never see happen. Because Poe's actions throughout the film don't have consequences. He tries a plan that doesn't work\\, but there is no consequence to him failing. No one dies because of it. Laura Dern's plan is still the one that happens\\, and Poe is carried along for the adventure without doing much.\\n\\nIronically\\, Yoda spoke the very words in this film \\\"Failure is the best teacher.\\\" The new characters don't fail\\, and so they never learn. They don't struggle\\, and when they do it's only momentary and with no consequence. And that makes them uncompelling. It's no fault of the actors. This is basic lack of script development.\\n\\n\\n2 - Flying Leia and other things\\n\\nThe film has good moments but never works enough to deserve them so they never pay off.\\n\\nFlying Leia could have worked (maybe) if the filmmakers had previously showed her using the force.\\nDon't get me wrong\\, I don't have an issue with her using the force. I wanted to see that more than anything actually. One of the biggest disappointments (among many) of The Force Awakens was to not have Leia be a Jedi as she clearly would have become after Return of the Jedi (they even used Luke's line from that very film saying \\\"my sister has that power\\\" in the trailer\\, for god's sake). Her use of the force in itself isn't the issue. The issue is that\\, in this new series of films\\, this was the first and only time she did so. So it doesn't feel deserved nor connected to the rest. If this was meant as a surprise\\, then the other characters should have reacted to it too. Surprise only for the benefit of the audience is stale and cheap.\\n\\nOn that subject\\, let's talk about Rey's parents.\\nI've read somewhere online that people who liked the film thought the reason other people didn't was that they were disappointed about the reveal about Rey's parents.\\nBut this isn't the reason this part of the film doesn't work.\\nThe issue is not that her parents are nobodies. The issue is that the filmmakers forgot from the start what the character wanted. Not to know who her parents were but for them to come back. This is the problem with choosing mystery over character. To Rey's character\\, who her parents are shouldn't matter. So the mystery is only for our benefit\\, us\\, the audience. And so it is pointless.\\nThis is the reason the reveal of her parents being nobodies falls flat. Because it has no bearing over her character arc.\\n\\nBy being so concerned with mystery (mainly in Force Awakens) and surprises (mainly in Last Jedi)\\, the filmmakers forgot to craft an actually journey for their heroes that made sense.\\nTo be fair to the Last Jedi\\, a lot of what's wrong with it comes directly from the poorly written Force Awakens. But not only. It has bad writing of its own\\, and there's no excuse for it.\\n\\nThis movie is full of big events that bear little to no consequence over the rest of the film. Leia reveals she can use the force: no comment on it from any other characters\\, no consequence on any part of the film. Snoke gets cut in half: overacted and one-dimensional Hux bitches about it\\, but no real consequence to the first order's run of affairs. Laura Dern lightspeeds herself into the enemy's main ship and tears it in half (a scene that seems like a very big and important moment when it happens\\, like a game changer almost): again no really impact over the course of events\\, only two minor ones: Phasma and her crew are somehow reset a couple of yards away from Rose and Finn for no apparent reason (besides conveniently allowing their escape)\\, and the resistance ships get to land on the planet\\, but as soon as the first order lands there\\, they behave as if nothing major had happened to their fleet.\\n\\nThere is more\\, and I'd be happy to talk about it more if somethings weren't clear or if you feel some comments were underserved. But for now let's end it there.\\n\\nJust one final word. If you liked the film\\, good. But don't reject criticism of it. See the problems in it. And say \\\"I liked it\\, but these are problems. Do better. We know you can do better.\\\"\\nExpect more from your entertainment. This is their job. Give them feeding back\\, don't let this go\\, and please\\, oh god please\\, let them learn from their failures.","true":true}
