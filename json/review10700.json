Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had the chance\\, the rare chance to give a beloved character a noble exit\\, instead the thunderous dud that we got is nothing but an insult to all fans of the original trilogy . Moves into Godfather 3 type of regret and dissatisfaction. Just don't understand why this was allowed \\,the minute Lucas signed away his legendary creation this was inevitable ...killing off the past in such a neffrctual callous way. This is the movie that Killed all the magic that made Star Wars ... Star Wars","true":true}
