Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Movie. I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life and was worried how The Last Jedi would turn out. I was very happy with the new direction and what we get to see. Rian Johnson did a great job at character development for everyone. We see Poe start to become a leader\\, not just a pilot. Finn willing to fight and sacrifice for what he believes is right. Kylo Ren grow up and stop living in his grandfathers footsteps. Rey come to terms with her life and who her family is\\, and that the past doesn't dictate who you become. I can't wait for episode 9\\, however will be skeptical about JJ Abrams taking back the reins\\, hopefully it isn't too similar to the original trilogy. But the Last Jedi is definitely worth seeing more then once in theaters.","true":true}
