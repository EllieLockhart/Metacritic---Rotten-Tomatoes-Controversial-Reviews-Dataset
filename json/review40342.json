Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of those movies that was entertaining to watch\\, but once it was over and I had time to think through the story... it got really bad. You can look around on the net and find the 1000's of things wrong with this and why it is anything but a Star Wars flick. Really sad to have it all end this way when we were still on cloud nine from The Force Awakens.","true":true}
