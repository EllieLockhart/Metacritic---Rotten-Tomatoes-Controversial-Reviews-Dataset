Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A universe so carefully crafted as star wars offers a million stories - each more colorful and intriguing than the one before.  Here we had a chance to build on a legacy 40 years in the making.  And instead we are going to reset the board and have a bunch of incompetents bumble on the screen.","true":true}
