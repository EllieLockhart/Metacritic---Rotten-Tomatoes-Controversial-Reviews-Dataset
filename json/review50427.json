Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2.5 out of 5 stars\\nClearly the budget was used up in its entirety on special effects because everything else in this film fell flat.  What a disappointment given the fantastic set up by its predecessor.  I simply couldn't get past the terrible script\\, stilted storyline development and awkward scene shifts.","true":true}
