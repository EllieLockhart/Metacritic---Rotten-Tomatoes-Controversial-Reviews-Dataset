Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen all Star Wars films\\, The Last Jedi is\\, by far\\, the most emotionally intelligent and most psychologically authentic film installment in the series. All of my preconceived notions were blown to pieces and it was a welcome shock - as all these notions were replaced by philosophical depth.  I actually never expected a pop film such as Star Wars could ever have explored such complex dynamics as guilt & failure\\, the burdens of leadership\\, the strength in humility\\, and ultimately\\, how genuine heroism has never been about grandstanding.  The Last Jedi is by far the most philosophically brilliant Star Wars movie yet; in the process\\, proving that its lead\\, Luke Skywalker\\, to truly be the wisest and most powerful jedi to have ever lived. \\n\\nAlas\\, the only weakness however\\, is that the thoughtful ideas presented in this excellent film will easily fly over the heads of a blockbuster-formula-hungry crowd\\, and will be appreciated only by a more mature audience.","true":true}
