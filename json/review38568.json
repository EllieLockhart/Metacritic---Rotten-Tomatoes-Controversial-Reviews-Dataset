Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever made. an absolute piece of shit\\, rian johnson has screwed this up beyond belief and also possibly future movies. Kathleen kennedy needs to be put in a lesser role and someone else needs to take over lucasfilm.\\n\\nthere's not even a lightsaber battle in this film\\, rey and kylo teaming up to beat the royal guard stormtroopers is not a lightsaber battle\\, rose was a terrible character and didn't need to be in the film whatsoever\\, the biggest travesty is how luke is used in this film.\\n\\ni still hope for the day that a star wars movie is made that takes place in the EU despite disney erasing it. still to this day the best lightsaber battle i've ever seen in star wars was in the star wars the old republic trailer \\\"deceived\\\". id honestly prefer the people who made these trailers to make star wars films in the future\\, at least they wouldn't fuck it up this bad \\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YdgmH9Vv2-I","true":true}
