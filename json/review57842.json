Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi was like reading the first pass of a junior fanfic writer's first 'proper' story.  Scenes and dialogue happen because the script demands it and not because the characters and situation would naturally result in it.  There is UNNECESSARY social commentary\\, forced character and creature interactions\\, universe breaking design elements\\, side plots on side plots\\, unimaginative story progression\\, poorly written and executed humour\\, massive character transgressions and little to no explanation for any of it.  Literally The only thing I enjoyed was the depiction of the female A-wing pilot Talli who at least appeared to be the first truly competent female military figure (Apart from maybe that 1 x-wing pilot and other dialogue-less side characters) depicted within these new films and yet they kill her off within the first half hour.  A complete waste of time and money to go and see a movie that strays so far from the source material its hard to remember it's even set in the same galaxy.  No\\, it's not a 0.5 star or 1 star movie\\, there is some good special effects (not Yoda) and sometimes the music is okay (Although it's still not as memorable as the older stuff\\, certainly no new 'Imperial March' level stuff this time) but it's all for nought when the writing and the direction of the movie was so terribly handled.  So it's 1.5 stars from me\\, a 3\/10 movie.  And the more you tighten your grip Disney\\, the more fans will slip through your fingers.","true":true}
