Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok. So. My biggest complaint. This game had clunky movements and it\u2019s open world\/linear mix didn\u2019t mesh well for me. I expected more for a late generation game. Particularly one that is a sequel to such an amazing game from an earlier console. The next issue I had was that I went through 3 days as Ellie and then the same 3 days as Abby. I would have appreciated jumping between the two through each day\\, so when I got to day 3 I was finished. I felt like it broke up the narrative a bit too much. Lastly. I really did hate they killed Joel. I felt like they could have found a better way to do the revenge story. Like have everyone in Jackson get killed except Joel and Ellie. Then Joel and Ellie go on a vindictive journey. It could have brought out all the same points\\, but Joel wouldn\u2019t be dead. I mainly didn\u2019t like this because Joel made the first game. I didn\u2019t enjoy playing as Ellie in the first game. I didn\u2019t even care much for her character. I cared for her even less in this one. I also really didn\u2019t appreciate playing as Abby. It was ok. Just not the most fun. She did some terrible things and was a terrible person. All I wanted was for her to die in the end. Lastly\\, the game play wasn\u2019t different enough from the first one to keep me engaged. Now. Admittedly all these issues\\, except for the first one\\, are all minor. I just think that with my expectations\\, and all the minor annoyances I found in the game\\, that I just struggled to appreciate the game in the same level as some of the critics. All in all not the best game to close out a console generation. Ghost of Tsushima is better as a whole. Albeit not necessarily in every way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
