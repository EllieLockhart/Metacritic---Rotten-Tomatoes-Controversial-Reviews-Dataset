Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as Force Awakens and definitely no where the originals triology level but still better than the 90's prequels. What I do like the Chemistry of Kylo Ren and Rey and it wasn't a dull movie. \\n The downside of the movie is Rey is a little over powered compared to past Padawans but hopefully everything is explained in the next installment. I also felt though Luke wasn't true to character in this film.","true":true}
