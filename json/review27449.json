Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a good movie. Rey and Kylo's story gets pushed forward while I feel Finn is stuck. The Finn storyline could have been completely removed and would not have changes the outcome of the movie. Enjoyed seeing Luke again and wish his final scene ended a little differently. There is a seen with Leia which is ridiculous. Canto Bight\\, hated everything about it\\, use it as a bathroom break. Two things I do not want in my Star Wars movie\\, kids and 15 foot tall space horses.","true":true}
