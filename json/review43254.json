Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a bad movie. The plot of it is essentially recycled from the older Star wars movies. Except so much political correctness. Why is it that no one was allowed to question the female leader in command? everyone was expected to follow her without question even though it seemed like a completely suicidal mission. \\nThe fact that Rey is somehow a master Jedi without any training is beyond insulting. Why did they kill off Luke the most interesting person? And why did they give so much airtime to Rose and Finn when their plot could have been taken out of the movie without any difference in conclusion? It's fine to have a diverse cast especially in a big universe\\, but just to force political correctness is insulting. the whole plot was just recycled and this should not be such a high score for this bad movie.","true":true}
