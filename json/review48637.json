Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst episode since Attack of the Clones. This movie sucked. Rian Johnson is a joke. And please Disney\\, do not let this moron make any more movies!","true":true}
