Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't the movie I expected. It has way too much silly humor\\, random plot lines\\, and over-the-top force usage. It was closer to Fast and Furious or Independence Day. BTW\\, I like those movies but it's not what I want when I see Star Wars.","true":true}
