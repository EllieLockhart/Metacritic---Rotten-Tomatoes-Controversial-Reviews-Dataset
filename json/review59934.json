I have just completed the game\\, I\u2019m a neutral gamer and flick between the consoles and PC. I absolutely loved it\\, I understand the story is not for everyone but without spoiler\\, I found it brutal and something not many video games try\\, it\u2019s worked for me and left me thinking about the previous game and all the encounters I\u2019d shared with the characters throughout. The game is simply stunning\\, and the gameplay\\, where sticking to the first game\\, and alike uncharted and tomb raider series\\, didn\u2019t blow me away but I found myself loving it\\, as I always have. It\u2019s a shame the reviews that purposely are just to hurt the games ratings are present as I\u2019d be interested to see how it would have compared to red dead redemption. I don\u2019t like placing a game which is so raw in my memory in any \u2018top lists\u2019 or \u2018one of greatest games ever\u2019 but I truly believe in 10 years time the last of us games will be looked back on so fondly\\, and will sure be one of my favourite games. As an avid gamer I often spend \u00a350-60 on video games from release and it can end up being disappointing and feeling money could have been spent better elsewhere. TLOU2 certainly doesn\u2019t go into that category. A game I truly loved.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
