Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so disappointed with this movie\\, it destroyed the past 40 years of the Skywalker saga.  The whole movie is a disgrace to any Star Wars fan.  Disney really need to wipe the film from history and start again with an actual writer\/director who appreciates the Star Wars saga and write a story knowing what fans want.  I don't know what these so call critics are watching but maybe Disney should employ actual Star Wars fans to review their films and get a realistic opinion. On a final note if Disney wants to make a new trilogy then go ahead but keep the skywalker saga out of it they clearly have no respect for fans and know idea on storytelling as the last jedi proved\\, the film was just a mess no story no arc  if you can take out an whole hour of a film which would not be missed (FIN) what does that say.   Money money money it was going make billions if the film was rubbish or not. This film is not a success in the eyes of the fans. Dissapointed is an understatment.","true":true}
