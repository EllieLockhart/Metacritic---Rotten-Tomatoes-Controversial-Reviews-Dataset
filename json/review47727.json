{"101487":196128,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When it was announced that Disney bought LFL\\, I was overjoyed. When I heard that George tapped KK's shoulder to lead LFL\\, I was even more enthusiastic. The same company who's Marvel and Pixar studios were the very model of quality story telling and respecting a the broadest stroke of their IP fanbases? I thought I'd died and become one with the Force. While I was disappointed with many aspects of TFA for what it did to the achievements of the Legacy characters\\, I still saw that film 9 times in the theaters because of it was overflowing with the same brand of charisma and excitement as the OT. In spite of my frustrations with the story\\, I was pleased with the new characters and the fascinating mysteries that JJ set up (JJ's specialty is after all\\, creating mystery). As happy as I had been when JJ was announced\\, I was even more excited to see what Rian was going to do. I loved Brick and thought he was a great fit to make a fascinating middle chapter. \\nThis is a lesson in mindful what you wish for. Never in a million years could I have guessed that RJ would make this colossal train-wreck. \\nThe Good: This film is beautifully shot. The actors\\, top to bottom were fantastic. They clearly gave their roles everything that the director was asking. Mark Hamill probably gave the finest motion picture performance of his career. Additionally\\, it was fantastic to see Carrie really grow comfortable getting back into the role that made her as famous as it made her miserable.\\nThe Cons: Literally everything else. There is literally so many things wrong with this movie\\, from the minute to the shockingly large\\, you could literally write a book on it\\, The script is an virtual how-to guide of what you don't do as a screen writer. Incomprehensible leaps of logic from the opening sequence to the final iris wipe\\, characters well-established personalities and strengths are washed away and turned into superficial plot contrivances.. The primary storyline\\, the interplanetary space chase is dumbfounding.. Admiral Ackbar forgot to top off their one ship before showing up for the evacuation with only enough 'fuel' for two jumps? Bombs need to 'fall' 'on top' of a ship in zero gravity space? Hyperspace tracking is suddenly a thing? A deserter janitor just happens to know where the controls are? Princess purple hair (what a waste of the incredible Laura Dern's talent) can't tell the crew her plan.. why?Because otherwise there's no subplot for Finn and Rose to go on.. and dear lord\\, what a shame it would be if we'd been robbed of that idiocy\\, all the while Rey timidly prods Luke\\, 'Get off my lawn' Skywalker to either train her\\, or return with her to SAVE HIS SISTER WHO IS IN DANGER.\\nBut where this film really falls down is that there is no real story. It is nothing but a series of clearly contrived plot points all designed to be a 'gotcha'. They come at you one after another.. they become so obvious that I began to see them coming.. let's see\\, he's telegraphing that this is the obvious next thing to happen. so it won't.. and.. there it is.. the story is terrible and implausible because at every point\\, it's contorted to generate Rian's precious 'expectation subverting'.  The title of this movie should have been \\\"Episode 8: Gotcha!\\\" because seemingly every 10 minutes\\, Mr. \\\"Look at me\\, I'm so clever\\\" substitutes surprise in place of compelling human stories. Not one character in the entire film is likable. Beloved old heros are abused beyond recognition\\, and crammed into a story so obviously a rehash of Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi it defies all ability to believe that someone of Kathy Kennedy's pedigree approved this script. \\nStop me if you heard this one before\\, our force trainee goes it alone with R2 to a backwater planet seeking a Jedi Master reluctant to train her\\, in the galaxy's hour of greatest need. Meanwhile the rest of our heroes are being chased through space by the bad guys\\, and unable to jump to hyperspace. Desperate\\, they seek the aid of a scoundrel to help them escape\\, only to have him turn on them. Then\\, let's have the good apprentice turn herself into the bad apprentice\\, who takes her in an elevator\\, up to a throne room to his master\\, where that Dark Master is killed by his apprentice and there is a massive fight\\, all while the good guys are getting slowly picked apart by the bad guys forces. Then\\, so it doesn't look like too much of an obvious ESB rip off\\, stick the  Battle of Hoth at the end but with Luke ForceFacetiming a faux lightsaber battle\\, and he then dies. The End.\\nThe trailers for this film sold a truly compelling film\\, full of hope and all of those amazing themes and concepts that resonated across generations\\, gender and borders.. and then 'subverted' those expectations by delivering a boring\\, dire\\, repetitive  deconstruction of the Hero's journey that literally had our biggest hero chastise fans through dialog for wanting to see him be the thing he's always been\\, through the original movies and countless novels of the now discarded Extended Universe.\\nIf I could give this film a negative rating\\, it would still be too good for this film.","true":true}
