I stopped playing and I'm not going to bother finishing it either. This game is the equivalent to Game of Thrones Season 8 epic failure! I just don't understand why everything about the first game was destroyed in this sequel. Everything I loved about the 1st installment\\, gone\\, just like that! Naughty Dog and Sony blew it and they were warned! The fans spoke after the leaks and told them what they didn't like. Naught Dog\\, Sony\\, and personally Neil Druckman himself\\, verbally attacked and criticized fans of being racists and misogynists\\, and assured fans the game would be loved by everyone. This game is an absolute blunder and will probably go down as the WORST sequel in video game history! Did Sony really think fans wouldn't notice the fake paid for \\\"Critic Reviews\\\"? Who are they trying to fool? \r\rThe only good thing I can honestly say without a doubt\\, the graphics are SUPERB!!!! Big props to Naughty Dog on the graphics! Mouth-dropping attention to detail! I will say the graphics are even better than God of War 4!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
