Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killed one of cinemas favorite characters then actually killed him in the movie. The hole plot centers around one persons reluctancy to share her plan with anyone making the whole movie avoidable. The new characters aside from Poe are complete trash. My favorite part of the movie is when rose is lecturing Finn about how slavery and animal abuse is bad while he was literally taken from his home as a baby to fight in the first order. I wish they would have explored Finn if they wanted to make that point in the movie instead of throwing in one of the most dumb and useless sub-plots in all of the movies\\, and yes I think that anakin and Padmes falling in love sub plot from episode 2 was much better because it actually advanced the Star Wars story\\, all Finn and rose do is fuck up and get the resistance\/rebels killed. I could go on and on but if you like Star Wars you won't like this.","true":true}
