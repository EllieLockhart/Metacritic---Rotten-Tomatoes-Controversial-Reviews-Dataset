Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the critics this time around. The movie falls short in almost every aspect\\, and it seems to take a giant dump on most of the SW-legacy (and yes\\, I am talking about legacy from the movies) and it does nothing to build up something new. I am not here to be rude or just to spit at something many people love. I am huge\\, huge SW-fan myself (look at my shirt!) and even though I felt\\, that TFA had some major issues\\, I really had hopes for this new trilogy. However... Wow\\, just wow. \\n\\nI will not spoil anything (I promise)\\, but I will say this: the movies does nothing to answer any of the many\\, many questions raised by TFA\\, at least not in an exciting or fascinating ways. And the story takes such drastic turns\\, that the only real\\, that lingers after this one\\, is how the hell are they going to make a third installment of this trilogy? I simply cannot see anything remaining after this wreck of a movie\\, that could build to an interesting \\\"conclusion\\\" in Episode IV (what is there even left to conclude on?). \\n\\nThis was really a surprise. Wow!","true":true}
