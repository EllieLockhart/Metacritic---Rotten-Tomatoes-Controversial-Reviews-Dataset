Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put\\, this is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back\\, and contains some of the best writing and acting of the entire franchise.  In many ways\\, it is the best Star Wars movie period\\, with a great deal more sophistication and layers of depth than Star Wars fans might be used to (and I believe this is what generated a large number of complaints from fans who were just looking for a simple action movie that satisfied the basic \\\"fan theories\\\").  Much of what happens in the movie is unexpected\\, even subversive\\, and this is what generates such great interest and gives it real gravity.  There is a great deal of subtext\\, again more than fans might be used to\\, and it takes repeated viewings to really gather everything together and understand the various character arcs.  The entire film is expertly executed\\, with truly excellent cinematography (again including the kinds of shots we haven't seen in a Star Wars movie before) and outstanding visual effects.  Even the movie's critics must admit it's a truly beautiful movie to lay eyes on.  Mark Hamill gives a career-best performance as Luke\\, and the chemistry between Daisy Ridley's Rey and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is sizzling.  There was a point about 2\/3rds of the way through that I was gripping my seat with genuine suspense over a key character decision\\, something that frankly has not happened to me during a Star Wars movie before.  And fear not\\, the action in this movie is some of the best in any Star Wars movie.  I especially found the battle between Rey\\, Ren and the Praetorian Guards to be breathtaking.\\n\\nMy advice for new viewers:  put all your theories behind you and watch with open eyes and an open mind.  Expect the unexpected\\, and don't expect the movie to spoon-feed you what you wanted or to answer every question about every character.  This is a grounded movie that takes realistic turns and avoids cliches.  I for one was thankful that in this movie\\, everyone important isn't related to someone else who is important\\, a tired Star Wars cliche that wore out its welcome way back in 1983 when it was revealed that Leia was Luke's sister.  Such groan-inducing situations are entirely absent in this movie\\, and in many ways are subverted.  I was also glad that the characters strayed significantly from their expected paths\\, because simply doing what was expected would have been a dull affair indeed.  Director Rian Johnson understands how to create and build true drama\\, and by the end of this film I felt emotionally drained in the best possible way - I felt like I'd been on a journey with these characters\\, watching them change and grow for better or for worse.\\n\\nA lot of the movie's critics are judging it as a \\\"Star Wars movie\\\"\\, and spend most of their criticism on nitpicking story points.  On that level alone\\, it may disappoint some that it doesn't do what's expected of a Star Wars movie.  Even though I'm a Star Wars fan\\, I'm judging it as a movie\\, period\\, and as a movie it works in every way that you want a movie to work.  Star Wars has been around long enough that it's collected quite a rogue's gallery of cliches and stereotypes\\, and it was a tall order to subvert all of those to create genuine interest and drama\\, an order that Johnson and Co. succeeded at in spades.  The bottom line:  this is a great movie that I believe will come to be appreciated more and more\\, and J.J. Abrams has his work cut out for him in directing the follow-up.  I wish him the best of luck\\, because this movie deserves a sequel worthy of its merits.","true":true}
