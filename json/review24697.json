Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was mediocre at best with unnecessary scenes. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a disappointment in the eyes of me as a Star Wars fan but as a movie fan it was ok. The movie was too similar to a Marvel and for that I rate this movie 2\/5 stars.","true":true}
