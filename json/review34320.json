Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action\\, acting\\, visual effects\\, music\\, directing\\, and sound design were excellent. You could tell that some much time an money went into this\\, and it shows. The story\\, however\\, wasn't handled very well-- by far the weakness aspect of the film. Also\\, Character behaviors are jarring and sporadic\\, making the viewer feel as if the character are merely pieces on a chess board that are used for shock value\\, social commentary\\, or to forcefully drag the series in another direction; it just doesn't feel right\\, and leaves the audience too little to connect with. Also\\, it didn't help that there were noticeable plot holes. Overall\\, I think this movie is a good popcorn flick\\, and that audience members will have more fun if they don't take it seriously or think too deep about it.","true":true}
