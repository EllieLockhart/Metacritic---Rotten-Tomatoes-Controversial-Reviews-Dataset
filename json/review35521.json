Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi has many strange plot choices that take star wars in a bad direction in my OPINION. A few tweaks to some scenes would make the whole film much better but I just don't like the way LUKE is portrayed at all\\, HE seems so cowardly\\, and doesn't seem at all like the old luke we once knew and some OF the things he does make no sense at all the sub plot takes up way too much time that could HAVE been better used with Rey and luke\\, rey just has force powers  now without any notable training from luke she doesn't need any training because she is already a master of everything\\, she learned how to fly\\, fight with a light saber\\, and use the force with absolutely no training at all whereas LUKE and Anakin all required years of training to master the same skills I was hoping rey would have to struggle and grow to become a better character in some way in this film but nope she really is worthy of being called a mary sue","true":true}
