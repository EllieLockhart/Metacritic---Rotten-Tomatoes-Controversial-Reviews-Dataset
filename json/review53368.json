Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the film\\, but have some harsh criticism:\\n1) The film in general was too long (didn't really need the casino scene)\\n2) Leia should have died\\, and not used to force to \\\"fly\\\" back.\\n3) Needed more backstory on snoke. (but fight scene with Kylo Ren and Rey against the Praetorian Guards was by far my favourite scene.)\\n4) The puppet for Yoda looked fat and weird compared to the skinny Yoda we remember.\\n5) Plasma should of had more influence into the plot.\\n6) Too many Porgs- obvious marketing scheme","true":true}
