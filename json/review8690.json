Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flat movie - Really - did they need the milking scene and the barmaid boob scene?  I did love the fight scene with Snoke - really interesting viewing.  I loved the crystal fox as well.  Saw it twice once in 3D and gave it a lower score the second time I viewed it.","true":true}
