Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined the established characters and let down several plot lines built up from Force Awakens.  There were too many attempts at humor that did not work or fit with the characters.  There is such a thing as too many plot twists or ones that do not make sense.  If you do not care about the characters or previous movies\\, you may like this for the action and special effects.  For me this is the worst film in the franchise by miles and miles.  I just pray JJ Abrams can fix some of it in Episode IX.","true":true}
