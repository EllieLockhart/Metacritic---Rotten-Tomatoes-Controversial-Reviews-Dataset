Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a very well done Star Wars movie I love the plot. I love the story. a very good transition from the old characters to the new. However it fails to deliver on a true Jedi fight","true":true}
