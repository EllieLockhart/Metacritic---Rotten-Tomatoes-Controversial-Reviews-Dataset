{"101487":167116,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put\\, don't go see this movie\\, don't watch it\\, don't buy it\\, don't give them your money. This was a horrible movie. I had hopes that they wouldn't screw it up\\, but they did. I left disappointed\\, I felt cheated and I didn't even want to watch Star Wars anymore\\, and I have loved this franchise since I was a kid. They completely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil was in his right to say that he fundamentally disagreed with everything they've decided to do with his character\\, because Luke is no longer a likable character). I had hoped to see a wise\\, old\\, and powerful Luke pulling of force abilities and saber combat that would've rivaled Yoda or Mace Windu. But\\, nope\\, they decided to make him a despicable character who barely uses the force\\, gives bad advice\\, refuses to teach Rey anything\\, and wants to rid the universe of the Jedi. The one cool battle scene with him ended up being a trick and he barely did anything (though the force ability he used was cool) then he dies for no apparent reason whatsoever. Rey is still good at everything with no training for nor reason and despite the fact that she is a nobody (yeah\\, another horrible surprise\\, her parents were basically the nobodies of nobodies). Her character doesn't progress at all\\, because she's already good at everything despite not knowing anything. Finn is still a main character for some reason and has a whole side story that turns out to be pointless and he probably should've died. Poe is a good character\\, until he is demoted and put in his place for no reason other than he didn't trust command because they're plan was stupid and purple hair lady didn't want to tell him anything. The asian girl who is introduced and made a main character for no reason is stupid and does nothing to the story other than give Finn a love interest and create completely unnecessary subplot. Adam Driver does a good job with Kylo\\, but the writers did a horrible job with the character. He is still unintimadating (I didn't think his character was anywhere near scary in 7 either\\, definitely not a new Vader) and is kind of stupid and changes emotions every scene. Snoke is shown to be super powerful in an awesome scene\\, until he is immediately killed by Kylo with a cheap trick that Sidious would've seen through easily. We learn nothing about Snoke so turns out he is another pointless character. Leia uses the force in a laughable scene that was supposed to be serious (apparently multiple theaters reported the audience burst out laughing) and probably should've been killed off. Phasma did nothing and was pointless (a common theme in this movie). Most of this movie would've been forgettable if it didn't piss me off so much because they ruined one of the greatest things ever produced. I'm pretty sure Rain Johnson heard that it was impossible to ruin Star Wars and make the new films worse than the prequels and decided to prove everyone wrong. I wish this movie (and probably The Force Awakens\\, though I liked that one more) should be wiped from canon and they should remake it. I don't want to watch any future Star Wars films after this one. I no longer plan on seeing Episode 9 or the Han Solo movie because I refuse to give money to these idiots who are ruing one of my favorite franchises of all time. DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.","true":true}
