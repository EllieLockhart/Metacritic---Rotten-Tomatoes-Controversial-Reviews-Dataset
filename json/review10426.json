Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. Yes\\, it did go way off canon\\, but I am basing this review based on the MOVIE and what is IN IT\\, not what some book says should be included. On that note\\, the film was highly enjoyable\\, had many twists\\, and left a lot of room for the character stories to progress in future Star Wars movies.","true":true}
