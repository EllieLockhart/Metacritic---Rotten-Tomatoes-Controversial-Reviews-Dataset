Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes risks and subverts audience expectations. The film centers around themes of failure and moving beyond the past to be become something new. That may seem jarring for a viewer initially\\, but the film also promises to put the series in an interesting place. It is important to realize that being too critical of a film for doing something new will discourage franchises from making anything original in the future. The Last Jedi surprised me\\, and I would like Star Wars to continue to do so in the future.","true":true}
