Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could write pages and pages of reasons why this film is awful but watching this film was already a waste of my time\\, so I'll make it short. It was just disappointing. Disney have an amazing opportunity to use new and up to date movie affects along with CGI to produce scenes that will blow the watchers mind! But nothing about this film is mind blowing...\\nThe wort thing about this film though is\\, there is not one lightsaber battle\\, not one! How can you make a Star Wars movie and not have some crazy lightsaber fight! \\nAwful.","true":true}
