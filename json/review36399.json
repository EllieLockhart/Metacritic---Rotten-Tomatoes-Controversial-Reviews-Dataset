Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most common criticism levied against The Last Jedi is that Johnson's storytelling disregards much of the lore built into George Lucas's Star Wars mythos. But even if one were to constrain the purview of their judgment within the sequel trilogy's thematic material alone\\, The Last Jedi still falls short as Disney\/Lucasfilm's answer to Empire Strikes Back.  Say what you will about The Force Awakens; despite the narrative's parallels with the first Star Wars film\\, the pacing was tight\\, a sense of urgency was consistent\\, the new characters and elements were intriguing and memorable. The legacy characters were given their due\\, and the questions unanswered at the film's end set the stage for a potentially interesting follow up. The Last Jedi\\, marred by Rian Johnson's chaotic approach to storytelling and complete disregard of Abrams's novel introductions\\, should provide Lucasfilm with an exhaustive guideline about things NOT TO DO when directing a Star Wars movie. While visually compelling\\, the movie ultimately felt hollow and disappointing as a result of Rian Johnson's decision to overstuff too many elements into a single film and to jettison the previous movie's interesting ideas. The Last Jedi\\, when centered on Kylo and Rey\\, builds on these two talented actors' interesting dynamic and the central roles that their characters play in defining a new direction for the Force. Outside of that\\, it fails to develop interesting character arcs for this new trilogy's secondary young heroes (e.g. Finn)\\, it scuttles the mystical aura of the Star Wars universe with ham-fisted attempts at humor\\, it dwells too muchon thinly defined and uninteresting new characters (Rose\\, Holdo)\\, and politicizes the narrative with clumsily disguised attempts to bring \\\"progressivism\\\" into the Star Wars universe. Most egregiously\\, The Last Jedi subverts the heroism and the nobility of Luke Skywalker\\, a great pop culture icon and arguably the saga's most important character. Not all scenes in the Last Jedi fell flat\\,. but an attempt at originality should never be accompanied by chaotic and inconsistent storytelling\\, and repeated attempts to disregard the mythos and lore of another creator.","true":true}
