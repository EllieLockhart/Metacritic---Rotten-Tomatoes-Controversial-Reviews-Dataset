Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolute mess of a movie. Way too long for a movie with such little substance. The only people who enjoy this are the people who have yoda tooth brushes and watch star wars trailer reactions. Seriously if you like quality film or the og films this aint for you. This was the last straw for me. ","true":true}
