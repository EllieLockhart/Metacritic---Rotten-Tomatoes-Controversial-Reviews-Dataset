Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so hyped for this movie after enjoying JJ Abrams' reboot in The Force Awakens. It had so many possibilities and new mysterious. All of that is thrown in the trash here. The characters are stale and do not develop at all. I can't believe that Rian Johnson wrote this script without Disney interference\\, especially based on the assassination of the character of Luke Skywalker. His story in the movie is so contrived and false compared to his OT self. There are some good scenes\\, but the overall movie felt contrived and awkward. The supporting cast didn't have much to do\\, so they made stuff up. Let's go to a casino planet to get a code hacker to save the resistance in 6 hours! Meanwhile\\, the leftover Resistance is fighting among themselves with a Poe leading a mutiny that didn't even have to take place if they just told everyone the plan! Luke's backstory with Kylo Ren is devastating to me as fan\\, because that is not Luke's character at all!  Don't even get me started on Superman Leia in space!\\n\\nI did like Kylo Ren and Rey's connection and the mirror scene. I was okay with some of the revelations that other people didn't like\\, but there just wasn't a whole lot to take from this movie.\\n\\nDisney has disneyfied my favorite franchise and it is disheartening.","true":true}
