Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

What the heck!?... This movie was awful on so many levels. Just read the negative reviews (not super vulgar or absurd ones) and they essentially share my feelings. Terrible terrible movie. The \\\"professional \\\" critics were paid off or something. This is NOT Star Wars or a good movie. The audience vs Critic difference says it all. Just awful. Period.","true":true}
