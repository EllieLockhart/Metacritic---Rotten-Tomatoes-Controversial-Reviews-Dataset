Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie.  Half way through I thought to myself\\, this movie sucks. Why all the jokes? Mary Poppins Princess Leia? Luke Slywalker wuss? Bad acting. Milk from a who knows what? \\n\\nPlot holes you could drive a truck through (Vice Admiral Holdo\\, just tell Poe the escape pods are cloaked - save you 30 minutes of movie in one sentence) and why even have Snoke as a character? Worthless...\\n\\nSo was this movie.","true":true}
