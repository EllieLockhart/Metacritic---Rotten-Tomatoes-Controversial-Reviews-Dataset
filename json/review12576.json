Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't even begin to explain why I loathe this film so much. It hurt just watching it. I don't even want to explain it at this point because I'm being told that I'm not smart enough to get it. It star wars. I grew up with it. You don't get it. Its such a meaningless piece of Disney propaganda. I will not watch again.","true":true}
