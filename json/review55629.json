Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why all the fuss from so many users. I\u2019m a long time Star Wars fan\u2014for reference\\, I thought the prequels were \u201cmeh\u201d and that Force Awakens trumps Empire and Jedi both. TFA is still my favorite\\, but I\u2019d have to say that I enjoyed this new one nearly as much. There are certainly a couple of \u201clet down\u201d moments that don\u2019t live up to Internet hype about what might be or what should happen\\, but the writers sort of have to do that\\, I think\\, when the internet buzz tries to come up with every possible scenario years in advance of the actual release. Overall\\, things end in a good place to pick up from in 2 years\\, and (spoilers) the one person that everyone \u201cknows\u201d was going to die actually didn\u2019t\\, and the one person everyone knew should not die (Snoke) actually does. It\u2019s not a 5 Star movie\\, but every bit a 4\\, and nowhere near a zero or 1 or 2. Go with the critics on this one (they can\u2019t get away with being biased assholes and keep their jobs).","true":true}
