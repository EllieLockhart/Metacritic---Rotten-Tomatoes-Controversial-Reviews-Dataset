Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi butchered the series. Everything that was in the earlier episodes no longer makes sense where a jedi can master the force as an adult in just three lessons? A Sith Lord was taken down in a blink of an eye? Whatever Luke Skywalker believed in and fought for in episode 4-6 seemed rubbish in the revelation in this film. There are so many good stories in books and video games out there\\, could not the director of this film take a leaf out of them?","true":true}
