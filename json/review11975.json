Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hyperspace-Ramming ruins canon. If followed to its logical conclusion all space combat would be engaged with hyperspace equipped missiles. Also with hyperspace a car-chase theme DOES NOT WORK. Was the first order incapable of jumping half their fleet directly in front of the rebels? Perhaps they were also short on \\\"hyper-fuel\\\". And finally the emasculation of Luke Skywalker\\, the greatest\/most powerful Jedi in Star Wars\\, is a slap in the face to the entire Skywalker saga. This movie is mutually exclusive from the rest of the Star Wars universe and should be viewed as no more than an expensive fan fiction","true":true}
