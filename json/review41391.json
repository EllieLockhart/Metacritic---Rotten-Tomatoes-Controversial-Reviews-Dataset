Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an absolute mess. The Leia floating in space sequence was ridiculous and made me cringe. I was trying so hard to not to fall asleep during the stupid Finn and Rose adventure\\, it was so pointless and boring and complete took the momentum from the film. Finally I have to say the amount of damn love interests this movie tried to feed us was so distracting and cheap. Rose likes Finn. Finn likes Rey. Poe likes Rey. Rey likes Kylo? It's so distracting\\, and the movie gave more attention to these stupid potential love interests rather than give proper deaths to Phasma and Snoke.... who were axed off like extras. This movie was a snooze fest I would much rather watch the pre-quels","true":true}
