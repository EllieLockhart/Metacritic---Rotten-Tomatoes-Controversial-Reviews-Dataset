Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Movie. Could things have been different? Sure. However\\, don't let your own personal expectations get in the way of enjoying the movie. You know\\, like wanting to see this play out in this certain way. Or that play out like this. When you do that\\, you take away from your experience of the movie. If you didn't enjoy it\\, it is your own fault.","true":true}
