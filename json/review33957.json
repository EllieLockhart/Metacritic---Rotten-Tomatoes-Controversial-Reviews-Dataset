Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible story. So-called critics must benefit from the movie's success. I did appreciate strong female roles and diverse races being represented. Can't believe critics overwhelming love this movie. How come almost all \\\"critics\\\" love it and general audiences dislike it? Why does Rotten Tomatoes call it \\\"fresh\\\" when the fans hate it?","true":true}
