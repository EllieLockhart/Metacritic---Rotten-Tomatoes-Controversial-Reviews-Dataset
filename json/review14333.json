Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guarantee George Lucas is just loving this\\, that smarmy bastard. His neck gobble jigglin' wildly with the thought of fanboys hating this more than 10\\,000 jar jar binkses. \\\"Where's your God now\\\" he mumbles\\, barely audible\\, staring off into space in that way you're not sure if the person is actually looking at you or not. This felt less like a star wars movie than the ewoks movies. This was harder to watch than the 2 hour holiday special that featured a 10 min scene of a Wookiee in an apron cooking a pork loin. Absolutely zero heart\\, unlikeable characters\\, awkward and unnecessary humor beats that took me out completely. From a technical stand point it was great\\, shot beautifully and interesting direction from Johnson. However\\, the Infuriating blatant disrespect for everything that has come before(original trilogy and as a sequel to the force awakens) ruined this as a movie. I wasn't fully on board with the story direction of the force awakens\\, but after no Star Wars for a decade and the last being ep3 I was fully invested in Rey\\, Finn\\, Kylo. Setting up snoke as the big bad I was leary\\, but on board. To have all this set up and no pay off whatsoever in any sense isn't clever or courageous writing\/directing\\, its poor storytelling. Even with the Luke\/Rey light saber scene being such a big deal and then for it to be what it is now\\, forever\\, is just unfortunate. It says to the audience this shit is dumb i'm not using it. Snoke\\, dumb not using it. Seeing luke as the Jedi master every fan has been waiting to see for 35 years\\, dumb not doing it. It was like Rain Johnson hated the force awakens so much he went out of his way to reiterate how terrible the story choices were to begin with. And Rey is Kylo's sister it's completely obvious where that should have gone\\, and that's not a bad thing. The force should be something that not everyone is able to ultilize and you know why? Cause that's the way this particular universe operates you don't need to go and switch up the rules already. This isn't superman with 75 years and countless stories. We've barely even scratched the surface of what this universe has to offer you don't need to change up core principles cause you can. Speaking of superman\\, aye yi yi...Been hoping for 30 years to see Leia use the force\\, whose decision was that\\, good lord. I have zero interest in further exploring disney's Star Wars universe. It's a damn weird feeling to be such a die hard collector and fan of something for over 30 years to wake up today and not care about it anymore...it's alright been hearing for years about this football deal people seem to like it maybe I'll check that out.","true":true}
