Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked into the advanced screening of The Last Jedi with high hopes. However\\, I was sorely disappointed. Without giving away too much\\, you can tell that Johnson used his original Last Jedi script (which was written before The Force Awakens was made). The characters from TFA are virtually unrecognizable\\, the plot is repetitive and predictable\\, there are MAJOR retcons from TFA that are simply glaring and unforgivable. The movie is also missing that Star Wars feel. Whereas TFA tried to reproduce the directional and aesthetic choices from the original trilogy\\, TLJ appeared to be a million-dollar stand-alone fanfiction written by Johnson for Johnson. Overall\\, I enjoyed maybe 45% of the movie - some scenes were indeed very funny or intense\\, or aesthetically incredibly pleasing. However\\, I cannot forgive Johnson for his misrepresentation of virtually every major character\\, as well as the glaring retcons from TFA\\, and frankly\\, the terrible direction in which he took the Star Wars franchise. Help us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
