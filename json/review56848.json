Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible\\, hardly even felt like a Star Wars film. JJ Abrams set up what could've been a great sequel to TFA and Rian Johnson threw all that potential away. The writing was awful\\, characters were flawed\\, every character who died deserved so much better\\, no respect given for the lore and plot holes everywhere. The forced humor and political undertones made this already bad movie even less enjoyable. Disney\\, is this seriously all $317 million was capable of?? Rian Johnson has shown his incompetence as a director and should never be let into a studio or near a Star Wars project ever again.\\n","true":true}
