Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning and made some bold and risky choices. A couple scenes fall flat\\, over all\\, Johnson expands the mythos of the universe and The Force\\, and is able to combine drama\\, humor\\, and fear into an epic 2 and 1\/2 hour ride that leaves you wanting more. That is a gold medal achievement for a middle movie of a trilogy.","true":true}
