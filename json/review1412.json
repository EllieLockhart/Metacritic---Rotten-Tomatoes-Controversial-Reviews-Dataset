Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, I don't see all the hate. I liked how they took a new approach while still being a little bit similar to Empire Strikes Back. Sure\\, there were a couple moments that you just had to say \\\"whatever\\\"  and roll with it\\, but it was overall great. I don't see how people said it was a bad story either. People say \\\"plot holes\\\" and I say \\\"doorways\\\". There is so much room to expand on this in books\\, comics\\, movies\\, shows\\, and more.","true":true}
