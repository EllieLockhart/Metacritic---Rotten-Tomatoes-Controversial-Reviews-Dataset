Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens wasn't made for the traditional Starwars fan\\, but created to bring a new story to the beloved Starwars universe. Breaking stereotypes yet fulfilling the essence of a true starwars film\\, The Last Jedi was everything the Force Awakens wasn't. While one cannont enter this film hoping for questions to be answered\\, they can hope for a fluid entertaining exsperince with a steady seemless flow of emotional and action packed scenes. Several character plots explored leave the viewer questioning the necessity or importance to certain plot points\\, however this displeasing at first plays into the broken stereotypes and provides an unsettling yet moving story outline. The film is thematically strong\\, tastefully humorous\\, and scratches every Starwars itch. *** While I personally hated on my first viewing The Force Awaken's cheap thrills\\, laughs and references\\, The Last Jedi provided everything I had hoped to see out of a \\\"New Starwars Film\\\".","true":true}
