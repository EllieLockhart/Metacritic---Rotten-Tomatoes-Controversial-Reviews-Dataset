Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kylo Ren was amazing\\, Porgs were cute\\, the action was great.  The only downfall was that I still don't feel a strong connection to the good guys the same way I did for characters like Obi wan.  Who knows maybe that will come with time.  Contrary to everyone else\\, I think Luke's role was great\\, I thought it was a great conclusion to his role in the series!","true":true}
