Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Doesn't deserve a high mark.\\n\\nRandom plot with abruptly forgotten story lines.\\n\\nGratuitous male nudity.\\n\\nExposition heavy dialog.\\n\\nCharacters wearing tuxedos in needlessly constructed sets.\\n\\nWeird choices in every scene that only the writer director will ever understand.\\n\\nYou want to look away but you can't.
