Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone whom has enjoyed every opening weekend\\, this installment is an absolute masterpiece. It transcends the Star Wars Universe. One of the best films I have ever seen. There are a few sticky points that logically bothered my nerdiness\\, but I have accepted them after a second and third viewing. It has gotten better every time!","true":true}
