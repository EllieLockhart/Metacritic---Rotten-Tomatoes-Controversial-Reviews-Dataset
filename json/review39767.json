Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a movie I actually agree with the critics over the fans. Of all the franchises\\, Marvel\/DC\/Harry potter etc. Star Wars fans are the most overreacting bunch. You'd think their childhood was ruined. For 2 years fans built up their own plots and theories and since it didn't go their way they whine about it. That aside. It was a fun movie. I thought it had a good plot to set up the next film.  I won't spoil anything\\, but go see it. It's worth it.","true":true}
