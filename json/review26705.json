Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok so I dont want to burst anyones bubble here but if you're over the age of 12 prepare to be disappointed. The amazing effects really weren't enough to detract from the huge plot holes\\, hammy acting and sloppy timeline. Leia flying through space....what the actual flip is all that about? Those cutesy puffin like creatures and the ice dogs were only created so that Disney can make some toys out of them and rinse the hell out of the viewing kids. I can say that as a 47 year old man it felt like the ending of a long marriage. That started out so amazingly\\, loads of excitement\\, plodded through some really dark and boring times to finally leave in the knowledge that shes gone to find a younger model. Maybe this is what I've needed. For someone to tell me to grow the hell up and stop living as my past 8 year old self. \\nMy only advice is to go see it with your kids. Don't go expecting it to rejuvinate you or you'll end up moaning for the next hour afterwards\\, how kids these days dont understand loss\\, or what an actual plot line is and why the heck Leia should not be flying. Not ever. That is all.\\nOh yeah and what makes this all the more personal is that Star Wars a New Hope was the first film I went to see at the cinema\\, at the age of 8. Kind of glad its been handed over to a new generation who will probably in 40 years time feel the same bitter disappointment I feel today. Live long and prosper :-P","true":true}
