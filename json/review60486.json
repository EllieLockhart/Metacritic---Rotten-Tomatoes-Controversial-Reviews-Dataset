They really could have taken it to new heights in TLOU2. Unfortunately - and for a reason I must not understand - it seems they deliberately wanted a car crash in this sequel.\rThere are some exceptional executions in this. The graphics and animation are first class and set a new benchmark. The gameplay\\, though same as previous\\, has some upgrades and is more fluid than before. The environments are very beautiful\\, though a bit same-same throughout the game.\r\rWhere this one goes off a cliff - and the reason we judge it so harshly - is that the execution of the narrative (rather than the narrative itself) is jarring to the point of offensive when you hold it next to the superbly executed original. Many people are angry at WHAT happens. I'm fine with what happens. It's a bit like the comic of The Walking Dead or the book The Road... its a bad place and can be brutal. How it was put together was like a case of bad directing\\, to the point that it broke the immersion and made the journey to the end of the game more like a slog\\, not a desire to see what happens. And the ending\\, without giving anything away\\, is just plain bad and has you feeling empty wondering what was this all for - what a waste of time and lives.\r\rIt's worse BECAUSE of the brilliance of the first. Similar to how The Godfather Part 3 was in part judged on how Part 1 & 2 were so fantastic.\r\rSome rearrangements on the play out of the story\\, some changes to the way characters seem to forget who they were in the first one\\, and perhaps even a toning down of the at-times grotesque violence (how showing the slaying of a pregnant woman is required or acceptable really is beyond me)\\, and this would be a worthwhile successor.\r\rAs it stands\\, it does the franchise a dis-service\\, and I will only watch for a third installment with half interest... I no longer really care about what happens in TLOU world.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
