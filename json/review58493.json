Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing Sequel for the newest trilogie of Star Wars. A lot of not expected humor in it. But definitely not too much. Some humor really hits and there are some misses. What the movie definitely not misses is depth. The last resistance has to take a lot of losses. \\nA lot of surprises come up. A lot of storylines you think you know where they're going but end up somewhere you never thought it could go. You never even you that would have been a possibility. The movie definitely ends with a lot of hope even though we have to take a lot of losses of major characters throughout the movie.\\n\\nPS: Don\u00b4t let this Audiencescore fool you. Yeah! the movie took a lot of bold choice but that\u00b4s how you move a franchise forward. And Yeah there is one particular sequence in this movie that wasn\u00b4t the best but that isn\u00b4t the whole movie! \\nAlso: A lot of this audience reviewers are trolls! Especially the ones giving 0 to 1 Stars. Just look at their profile\\, how many reviews they made and when they joined Rotten Tomatoes.","true":true}
