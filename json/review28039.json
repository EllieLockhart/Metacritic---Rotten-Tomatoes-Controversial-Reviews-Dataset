Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes. \\nSomeone forgot to pay the gas bill. \\nPanda head. \\n\\nStill can't physically believe that Kylo is the son of Han. He looks nothing like him. Really you couldn't find a guy that physically looks similar to Harrison Ford? \\n\\nDumb movie. Disney just slap the Star Wars name on a movie make a 1billion dollars.\\n\\nHow many plot holes can you lick to get to the center of a bad movie?","true":true}
