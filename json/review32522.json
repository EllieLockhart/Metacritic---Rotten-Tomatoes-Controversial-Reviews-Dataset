Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a film largely about failure and nostalgia. It depicts the same galaxy far far away\\, but things aren't the same as it used to be. The simple missions that once could save the galaxy are not enough in this new era. They realise it too with the conflict becoming about the fate of past at one point. It is a wonderful film and an excellent addition to the series.","true":true}
