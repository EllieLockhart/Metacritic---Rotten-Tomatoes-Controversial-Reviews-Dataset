Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad story line: Pretty obvious plot. Apprentice kills master. Bad guy (kinda) becomes the good guy. The story of Finn Rose and the code breaker didn't add anything to the movie. Why the hell did they wait so long before deciding to ram the other ship with light speed\\, don't they have auto-pilot?!\\n\\nBad characters: Luke was able to turn darth vader into a good guy\\, why isn't he able to see the light in his own apprentice?! Kylo couldn't kill his mother\\, killed his master and wanted to restore order. He shouldn't be the bad guy in the end. Why the hell would the code breaker give back the medallion if he was going to sell them out anyway?! How can Rey become a decent jedi in 3 lessons\\, while Luke and Kylo trained for years..?\\n\\nTechnical errors: Laser beams are photon particles\\, they don't bend for no reason like the movie showed. Leia can't survive\/freeze in the vacuum of space.\\n\\nGood graphics: current technology is much better at making special effects of course.\\n\\nCatering to stupid desires: Certain aspects where plain obviously for the stupid. The cute fluffy bird things that mess small things up (how original...). Way too many empowered women (because society demands it). Everything just had to be bigger\\, better\\, more powerful...\\n\\nSummed up:\\nYou can't fix a bad movie with more flashy lights and bigger guns...","true":true}
