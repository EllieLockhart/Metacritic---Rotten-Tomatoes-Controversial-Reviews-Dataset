Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A remarkable movie\\, truly something for the next generation to pore over. It's simultaneously new and yet feels like entirely like a Star Wars movie. All the new characters are a joy to watch\\, Rey is amazing and Kylo Ren is one complex character you really want to see redeemed but also punch in the face for being a total idiot.","true":true}
