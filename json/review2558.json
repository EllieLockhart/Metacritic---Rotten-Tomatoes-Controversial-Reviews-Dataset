Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome and entertaining movie but lacked the \\\"feels\\\" of a Star Wars movie.  Rian Johnson missed the mark.  I'm sure newer fans and young fans will love it but it lacked nostalgia.  I felt numb after seeing it and it wasn't until the next morning that I realized I was disappointed.  Hopefully JJ Abrams redeems the franchise in 2019.","true":true}
