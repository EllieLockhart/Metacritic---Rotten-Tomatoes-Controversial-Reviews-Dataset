Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a long wait\\, what a disappointment this movie is. Story feels rushed with many plot-holes and continuity problems from TFA.\\nIt looks and sounds like a Star wars movie with its cutting edge visuals\\, amazing sound-fx and gorgeous music score by John Williams. But it feels empty\\, with no character development\\, it lacks any kind of emotional content. I couldn't care less about any of the new characters now\\, which is a shame because they had so much potential after TFA.\\nI loved both TFA and Rogue-one\\, but I just cannot accept TLJ. It feels like a cheap generic sci-fi movie in a flashy Star wars wrapper. \\n\\nI sincerely hope the Star wars brand can recover\\, but the last jedi was a big let down for me and left me very unhappy and disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie.","true":true}
