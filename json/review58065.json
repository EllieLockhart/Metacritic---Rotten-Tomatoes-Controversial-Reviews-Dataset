Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With TFA bringing us back to a place we once knew and seemingly washing away the stain which was the prequels\\, I was excited to see what TLJ had in store for the backstories of Rey\\, Snoke and Kylo Ren\\, whilst also bringing the iconic Luke Skywalker character back to the big screen. \\nWith my excitement hard to contain\\, I sat back on opening night at 12am ready to see what Rian Johnson had cooked up. Unfortunately come the end of the screening and getting back into my car\\, my thoughts were clear\\, this movie sucked.\\nThe things I went into this film excited for were found to be completely depressing and the issues I had with TFA (although I enjoyed TFA) were only made worse.\\nWho was Rey? No one\\, what was her backstory? Nothing\\, how has she become so powerful with no training? Don't think about it. Who is Snoke? No one\\, What's his backstory? Well you get the idea.\\nMy other concerns were\\, did the film expand on the lore and mythos of the SW universe\\, nope; did the film expand on characters established in TFA? Nope\\, there was stuff I was excited for going into TLJ\\, can I think of one thing I'm excited to find out about in Ep9? No.\\nThe story of TLJ was\\, \\\"we (the rebels) are being chased by the empire\\, we cant outrun them\\, and for some reason they cant use hyperspace to leap frog us to cut us off\\, so we are traveling through space and running out of fuel with the side characters getting sent on a pointless mission to shove current day politics in our faces\\, with this side story agreed by all as one of the worst stories in SW to be inflicted upon its audience\\, also Luke is now an awful human being who sits back and watches the galaxy go to $~!t\\, after his part in the attempted murder of his nephew and student whist he was sleeping. Come the end of the film\\, the rebels are still fleeing the empire after nearly 35 years\\, Ackbar is dead\\, Luke is dead\\, Han is dead\\, nenub is still in the cockpit and the war rages on. (its like the battle of Endor never even happened). \\nIll summarise by saying  SW movies about peoples starships running out of fuel are not for me\\, and I'm kind of bored to death with this whole \\\"empire vs rebels\\\" rehash\\, filled up with nostalgia and PC culture. Until Star Wars becomes something new that is not dependant on X-Wings\\, AT-AT's and lines and characters from the original trilogy\\, I think ill stay away. I could forgive all the issues I had with the film in regards to my personal preference\\, had the story and characters been written to at least a half decent standard\\, if I wanted to have subpar quality in my SW films\\, I would of gone and watched a marvel movie and turned my brain off for 2 plus hours.","true":true}
