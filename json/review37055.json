Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new director is tone deaf to the nature of epic science fiction\\, for example with bits of humor that are inconsistent with the genre.  He's not the only offender--as well as Disney has handled Marvel IP\\, it's handled Star Wars as poorly:  the attempt to go off into another thematic direction is inconsistent with a 'Skywalker Saga' that purports to encompass all three trilogies.  The key word is 'attempt' because as much as the director would like to take Star Wars in a different direction--e.g. with muddling the good versus evil struggle in the form of suggesting some alliance between Rey and Kylo--that never reaches escape velocity.  This film delights critics for taking chances and growing the franchise in a different direction\\, but it's inorganic and\\, not all growth is good\\, like cancer.","true":true}
