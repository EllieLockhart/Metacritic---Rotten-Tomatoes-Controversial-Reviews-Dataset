Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the Force Awakens was a soulless cash grab. An insulting\\, empty film. But this? This was just plain STUPID. Zero character development\\, the characters start and end in the same place\\, the STORY does not move forward. What the F*CK is Kathleen Kennedy thinking?? The balance has shifted. We have 5 lousy films and 4 awesome ones. Hopefully Solo will set the balance again... What an absolute travesty.","true":true}
