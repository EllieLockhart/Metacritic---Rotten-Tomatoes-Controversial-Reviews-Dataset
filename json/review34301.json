Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst star wars movie I've ever seen. I was excited going in to this movie because the Force Awakens wasn't that bad\\, granted it had its moments of stupidity. This movie disregards the rest of the films and decided to rewrite characters and how the universe works. A third of the movie was a waste of time and added a character everyone hates (not the actresses fault). Please don't screw up episode 9 and please remake this movie so it isn't a pile of trash.","true":true}
