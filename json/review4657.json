Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete and utter let-down. It felt like a movie that had Star Wars references rather than an actual Star Wars film. This film managed to completely detach itself from the saga by ruining the image of the old characters and by adding really boring side stories. You cannot feel sympathy or hate towards any new characters because their back stories are weak or non existent. Also\\, what's with the constant jokes Disney? The only good thing was the special effects.","true":true}
