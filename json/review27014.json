Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star wars movies of all time. It wont be what you expect\\, but if you can leave your expectations at the door and really get at the heart of the film you will have a great time with beautiful action scenes and character development for the entire main cast.","true":true}
