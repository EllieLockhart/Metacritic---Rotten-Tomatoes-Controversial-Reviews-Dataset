Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filme fant\u00e1stico que chega para complemental a saga com novas hist\u00f3rias. Mostra\\, acima de td q os personagens seu s\u00e3o seres capazes de errar\\, seu s\u00e3o arrepender errar buscar o aperfei\u00e7oamento.
