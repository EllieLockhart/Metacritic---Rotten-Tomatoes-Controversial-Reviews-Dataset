Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot - and I mean a LOT - of the hate for this film is unfounded. There's a lot different here\\, but I think this has the most powerful message of any Star Wars film and is the key to setting up the rest of Disney's Star Wars users. And for all the old-school Legends fans\\, ESPECIALLY fans of KOTOR and KOTOR 2\\, there's a couple of nods to you guys.","true":true}
