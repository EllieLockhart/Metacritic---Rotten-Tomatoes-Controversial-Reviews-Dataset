Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hear a lot of people saying it is the worst Star Wars film or the best\\, but I can't say I thought it was either. There were some parts I  liked and some parts that left me really disappointed. If you aren't a hardcore fan\\, wait for video.","true":true}
