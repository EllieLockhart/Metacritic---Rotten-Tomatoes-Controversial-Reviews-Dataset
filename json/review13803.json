Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found this movie an extreme letdown\\, even mark hamill hated what brian johnson did with the character\\, so if one of the main actors doesn't like it that's when you know it's not that good","true":true}
