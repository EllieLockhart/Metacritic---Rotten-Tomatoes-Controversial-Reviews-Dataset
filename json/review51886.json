Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a few toy ideas based on the last jedi...\\n-\\\"disappearing\\\" luke (cardboard cutout luke because he's not really there...)\\n-kylo ren with \\\"removable clothes\\\"\\n-\\\"space skype fingers\\\" action rey and kylo ren\\n-\\\"rocks lifting\\\" rey\\n-chewbacca with \\\"eat or no eat porg\\\" action\\n-\\\"flying frozen\\\" space leia\\, a solid one piece hovering desktop display leia...\\n-rose with \\\"kiss and die\\\" action\\n-dripping bacta suit finn\\, \\\"fill it with water and squirt it out\\\"...\\n-resistance bomber\\, with \\\"drop bombs and self explode\\\" action...\\n-AT-ST legs only\\,\\n-throne room \\\"sliced in two\\\" supreme leader snoke\\,\\n-200 dollar giant resistance capital ship\\, with \\\"pull back and go kamikaze\\\" action\\n-500 dollar super duper giant first order dreadnought\\, with \\\"short range ineffective nerf canons!\\\"\\, and with \\\"sliced in two explode!\\\" action...\\n-1000 dollar mon calamari ship hangar playset\\, comes with 2 a-wings\\, an x-wing\\, and \\\"everything explodes before you play\\\" action...\\n-achto island black hole dive rey\\, complete utter blackness playset\\, with a \\\"mirror that shows.....rey!\\\"...\\, comes with diving rey figure...\\n-luke back on the millenium falcon playset\\, comes with falcon cockpit and luke\\, recreate the scene where luke enters the falcon cockpit and gets the golden dice...\\n-fire starter ghost yoda...flick yoda's hand and start a fire... gas oil not included...\\n-so exciting\\,\\,\\,","true":true}
