Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"0 World building. It is just some 0 brain action movie in star wars costume. Ever wondered how can like 5 ship oppose a faction which owns the galaxy now...i suppose because nothing was answered.","true":true}
