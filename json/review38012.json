Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars film that made me never want another SW film made. I could list all the stupid parts of this film but others have covered them in depth. Simply the worst Star Wars film ever made. I'm hoping that the next Star Wars film treats this one as a dream sequence.","true":true}
