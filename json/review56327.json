Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Super leia\\, all of Luke being a btch No knights of Ren Finn and the story w him being pointless Did i say mary poppins leia? Why Luke....nvm No plot Out of gas in space Bad writing Bad tactics (serious the first order couldnt jump anything from anywhere to stop em... really) What happened to the red crystal around Lukes neck? Reys parents Snoke phasma Benicio del Torros s-s-s-studder. No point in canto byte Bad plot holes Bad writing Snoke not seeing whats going on around em Again... Everything w Luke... we didnt wait 34 years to see.... whatever this was.... was really bad\\, felt like a slap in the face Always saying kill the past (refering to the OT).... oh wait... you werent asking me... well theres a lot more.","true":true}
