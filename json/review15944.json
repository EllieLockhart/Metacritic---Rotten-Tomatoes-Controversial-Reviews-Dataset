Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a big Star Wars fan and I didn't like TFA so I really really wanted this movie to be good and get me excited about star wars again\\, sadly that didn't happen. From start to finish things didn't add up or make sense. Rose is the most pointless character and hate every scene she was in\\, Finn was pointless\\, Po was annoying\\, Rey is the most powerful Jedi every but has never trained and didn't even know what Jedi were until a few months ago. Just everything wrong with this movie and this franchise","true":true}
