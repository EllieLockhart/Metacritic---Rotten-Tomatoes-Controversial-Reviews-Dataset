Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Why? Oh I don't know how about the mere fact its pure SJW feminist crap. Seriously like we need another movie pushing purple hair\\, beta male\\, women can do anything men can do so lets make all the officers women\\, pilots and heroes women and all the men arrogant mean feminine beta males. Why not call this Star Wars The First Feminist? Sorry\\, but if you like this movie and you're a male\\, you are the most spineless beta male in the world and need your man card pulled immediately. While you're at it\\, check your testosterone levels. This movie is GI Jane\\, New Ghost Busters on steroids.","true":true}
