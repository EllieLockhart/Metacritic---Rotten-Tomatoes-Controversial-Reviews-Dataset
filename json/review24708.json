Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was pointless. most boring chase sequence-turned-movie i've ever seen. The heroes leave to save the day (with no audience urgency in regards to above chase-sequence)\\, but fail at it\\, so a random and uninteresting new leader does something they could've done since the start anyway. It was all filler and pointless.","true":true}
