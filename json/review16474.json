{"101487":137054,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sure where to start... I'm still amazed by how many major and minor things this film got terribly wrong. However\\, I would like to say that I'm not a salty old man that hates this film because of it's \\\"Feminist\\\" agenda as many people have been quick to call that card on those that see huge problems with this film. Nor am I a super fan boy\\, I'm just a lover of Star Wars\\, who grew up with these films and wanted more than anything to see them done well.\\n\\nMy main Problem with this film is how Rian Johnson has completely wasted the original cast\\, non more so than Mark Hamill's Luke. After the cliff hanger at the end of TFA I was looking forward to seeing Luke in action and exploring how is character has changed since ROTJ. Even if he had taken a bitter turn over the years from the hopeful Jedi Knight we remember. However\\, all the decisions made for Luke in this instalment were not just bad but insulting to the character and the original movies. Such as\\, Luke milking the tits of a giant sea creature and the general comedic tone of the character\\, that like the rest of the films comedic elements\\, just did not land. And in fact just served as a negative destraction from the films supposedly dark tone. Luke's whole arc and involvement in this film was terrible and ultimately his death seemed pointless and disrespectful to the character\\, actor\\, lore and fans.\\nOne more quick example of wasted original characters was Chewie... Where was he? He had what felt like 5 minutes of screen time and added nothing to the story of the overall film.\\nThese problems aside\\, the plot of TLJ is awful and nothing short of contrived. The whole cat and mouse chase between the resistance and new order was simply ridiculous and a poorly thought out plot devise in general. This was made worse by the sub plot of the casino planet that felt nothing short of a waste of valuable screen time that added almost nothing to the over all plot or emotional impact of the film or characters involved. It essentially felt like two badly written films jammed on to the same screen to create one very long disjointed movie\\, that neither developed existing (Finn and phasma) characters or introduced any likeable new ones. In fact\\, the ways in which this film addresses the burning questions left after TFA (The main ones being\\, who is Snoke? and who are Rey's parents?) are some of the most anti climatic in cinema history and is sure to leave a bitter taste in many fans mouth's. \\nMany people have claimed that this movie was too bold and different and thats the main reason for the negative opinions\\, however\\, this is simply not true. The main narrative is identical to that of the originals\\, as in theres is a evil galactic empire that can only be stopped by a small but resourceful rebel force. And I would actually argue that this so called new and bold direction actually just renders the original trilogy as null\\, void and pointless. \\nI really wanted to enjoy this film and see what new direction Star Wars taken but instead I sat through what felt like a poorly written Avengers movie that gave me no hope for the future of the franchise and severely detracted what we loved about the original trilogy.","true":true}
