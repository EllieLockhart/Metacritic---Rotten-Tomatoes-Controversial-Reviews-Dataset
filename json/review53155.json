Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A worthy attempt to try and shake things up turns into something of a disappointment through dead-end stories\\, wasted characters\\, and not least of all dragging original trilogy's characters through the mud.    \\n\\nAs I see\\, there is only one actual character left in the film\\, and I seriously doubt anyone knows where he or the narrative as a whole are going in the next film.   Although I enjoyed the film as I saw it\\, and the visuals and nods to classic Star Wars\\, Samurai films (the throne scene a'la RAN or Kagemusha?).   However\\, did we really need a rehashed Battlestar Galactica storyline to be the set piece of the entire film?   The tension from said situation was broken by subplots that went in all directions and kept me searching for rising drama and catharsis\\, never to really get there.\\n\\nI don't want to be a hater- but this film\\, though entertaining\\, was the most cynical example of modern cinema- and though beautifully made (Lucas' words) probably didn't need to be made.     Someone said before Disney was done with these films we would long for the good ol' days of the Prequels.   At the time I didn't believe it- I thought Disney would know what to do to hit all the right notes for all the right audiences.  However\\, this film should make if not every viewer\\, at least every Star Wars fan who grew up thinking Luke brought peace to the Galaxy might want to seriously think about forgetting these sequel films.   There is so much Star Wars stuff out there in Legends and in other media that there is no reason to waste your hard earned money to feel empty after a movie.","true":true}
