Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  The film's visuals are great\\, and I do like the fresh takes on Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo.  However\\, the film has several poorly written scenes and numerous plot holes that are just too glaring to ignore.  While I like humor in Star Wars\\, the choices here were just bizarre -- the jokes just didn't land. \\nStar Wars\\, by its nature\\, is a bit silly\\, but this was just too much.  Overall\\, it felt like Rian Johnson was thumbing his nose at longtime fans.","true":true}
