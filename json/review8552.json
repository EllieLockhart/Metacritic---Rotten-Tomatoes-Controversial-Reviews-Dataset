Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, Kylo\\, you are not Darth Maul\\, you are boring emo wimp\\, KEEP YOUR DAMN HELMET ON! \\nSecond\\, Ren\\, rei\\, ray\\, whoever\\, still a Mary Sue... I guess SOMEONE likes that\\, seeing people went to see it before the Blueray release. \\nThird\\, Salt Troopers. I actually thought this was clever jab\\, but seeing how the writing otherwise is again by the same 5yo fanfict blogger\\, no.\\nFifth\\, I guess people must have really been upset that TFA didn't have a Jar-Jar -enough of a character\\, so you \\\"gave us\\\" Rose. Nice one\\, you really do hate your audience\\, don't you?\\nSixth\\, I just don't get what hell kind of loony-bin logic these movies operate with. Empire was nearly crushed in RotJ\\, then they are suddenly building Super-Deathstar in TFA. Then that gets destroyed\\, and instead of making them weaker\\, they now rule the whole galaxy. Ok\\, I guess Snoke is really a badass sith lord\\, no wait he gets killed by his own stupidity and incompetence... wow\\, ok\\, what the fuck? Kylo in a complete pussyass\\, so it was not by his \\\"genious anything come true. His mini-hitler general is certainly not smart either\\, just a another screeching lunatic. Fine what ever\\, it''s \\\" just a movie for kids\\\"\\, and it's dumb\\, and I will rate it as such.","true":true}
