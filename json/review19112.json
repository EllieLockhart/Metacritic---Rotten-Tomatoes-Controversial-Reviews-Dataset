Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to walk away from the film feeling like you've gained much in the way of intellectual stimulus. Granted maybe that's not what you're hoping to get from the movie. Maybe you just want visual entertainment. In that case you'll love this film\\, because that's all it really offers. Just like going to see a fire work show\\, intriguing sights and inspiring sounds is what you get. The film is extremely lacking in genuine character development or just generally good story telling. My overall feeling after viewing is still \\\"why does any of this matter?\\\"","true":true}
