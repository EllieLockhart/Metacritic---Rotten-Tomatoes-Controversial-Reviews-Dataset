Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"....aaaaaand the price for the best bought comment goes to:\\n\\nJake R\\n\\n\\\"Expertly expanding on the saga's rich source material with newfound vision & stamina\\, THE LAST JEDI is nothing short of a triumph. Exploring a massive cast with equally colossal storyline\\, director Rian Johnson misdirects viewers' expectations in all the right ways without sacrificing the lore of the series or bogging down progression with unnecessary plot. This is one of the most exciting entries in the franchise\\, with dazzling visual effects and masterful performances\\, most notably from Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver\\, John Boyega\\, Oscar Isaac\\, and the beloved Mark Hamill. TLJ proves that Disney is far more than capable of taking this series to new heights\\, creating a new sci-fi classic that excels. Without a doubt this is a blockbuster masterpiece of 2017.\\\"\\n\\n- Expertly? An amateur film student could have produced a better script\\, with less plot holes\\, pace issues and tone errors.\\n\\n- Newfound vision? I concede this. In fact this movie IS NOT STAR WARS. Is something else\\, and therefore new. If you don't like Star Wars\\, this is the movie for you. But please don't come here to teach real fans what Star Wars is. You obviously don't know it.\\n\\n- Nothing short of a triumph? For who? The millennials pissing in their pants when they see an almighty girl who is never menaced and never hurt\\, never has to grow or deserve the abilities she has? Or the feminazis who get their pants wet by watching an absolutely incompetent admiral womansplaining a hero or a geriatric princess slapping him for doing what heroes do? Or is it a triumph for social justice warriors who are more than happy of freeing animals which will be recaptured in 5 minutes\\, while completely forgetting to care about enslaved children?\\n\\n- Colossal storyline? Go watch on youtube. Thousands of videos mocking this movie and the hack who directed it. A colossal pile of shit.\\n\\n- Rian Johnson misdirects. OK\\, you are right. And he does it big time!\\n\\n- Without sacrificing the lore of the series: LOL\\, this is the exact opposite of the truth. Rian Johnson ruined the lore and destroyed the OT characters. Even in the old movies.\\n\\n- Without bogging down progression with unnecessary plot: LOL\\, the whole Internet is shitting on the Canto Bight scene for this exact reason. You are pathetic. Or stupid. Or both.\\n\\n- Masterful performances\\, most notably from Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver\\, John Boyega\\, Oscar Isaac: LOL\\, if they used wooden puppets\\, no one would have noticed the difference. Wait. Are we sure they didn't use them?\\n\\n- Taking this series to new heights: You'll see empty theaters when Solo and Episode IX will come out. Disney has done Harakiri with TLJ and they will pay for it.\\n\\n- Without a doubt this is a blockbuster masterpiece of 2017: Jumanji did better. I REPEAT FOR YOU SLOWLY. J.U.M.A.N.J.I DID BETTER. And a lot of other movies by the way. China vomited The Last Jedi. And they said it is for low IQ people... like you.\\n\\nTLJ is masterpiece for the idiots who did not notice that Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy slapped them in the face multiple times. Are you one of them? I think so.\\n\\nGo trolling elsewhere\\, douchebag.\\n\\n----\\n\\nA little suggestion: you and the other trolls paid by Di$ney\\, should avoid to create accounts in clusters of 3. \\nALL positive comments are posted in clusters of 3.\\nIt makes your stupidity even more evident...","true":true}
