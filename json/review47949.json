Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it had some interesting scenes\\, Rogue One and TFA were much\\, much better. I had read bad reviews and thought maybe people were exaggerating\\, but this movie is truly awful and boring. At least that purple haired sour face died in the movie. Even the cool and fun characters are turned into idiots. Also why is everyone in the first order always yelling and angry. Why not some cool\\, under control villains? Also I remember when the rebels used to plan attacks\\, it would build tension and we had fun build up scenes. Rogue one did this the right way.  I advise people who are truly star wars fans to not even see this movie\\, it will only make you sad inside. I would rather watch phantom menance or chewy's asshole for 2 hours.","true":true}
