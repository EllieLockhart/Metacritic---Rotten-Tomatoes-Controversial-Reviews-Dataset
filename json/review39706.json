Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a \\\"fun\\\" movie to watch\\, but........ I am so disappointed with Johnson's direction for the movie. Once again\\, Disney couldn't come up with a plot that didn't copy the original trilogy.  After pumping up the questions of who were Rey's parents and who Snoke was......total let down. Finn and Rose's mission was a complete waste of time because it didn't contribute to the story AT ALL!  Luke\\, the anchor of the franchise\\, is a disgruntled\\, gone crazy\\, hermit. It is obvious Disney wants to kill the old characters and move on. Phantom Menace was better!","true":true}
