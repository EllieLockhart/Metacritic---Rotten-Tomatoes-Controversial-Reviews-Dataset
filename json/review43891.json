Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though I came out of the movie disappointed\\, I still intend to see it again. When 'The Empire Strikes Back' came out it wasn't well received either\\, however it now has the freshest rating on rotten tomatoes and is my favorite. I'll give 'The Last Jedi' the same consideration in that my view may change after it I give it time to process.\\n\\nAnd now a note for those fans out there who viewed the movie negatively\\, give it time to percolate\\, then check it out again. Give your opinion an opportunity to mature. My belief is that the fans most upset with this movie\\, may have had preconceived notions that were not met\\, and they are a little butt hurt that their theories were not validated. Maybe they thought they knew whose Rey's parents were\\, or they wanted more history on Snoke. Get over it. If after time you still don't like the movie\\, it doesn't invalidate the ones that you did like. You still have the original trilogy.","true":true}
