Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson succeeded in dividing the fan base.  He succeeded in ruining the story\\, ruining the original and new characters\\, and ruining the lore.  Making changes just to make changes is not the way to make a film.  Too much politics and not enough plot.","true":true}
