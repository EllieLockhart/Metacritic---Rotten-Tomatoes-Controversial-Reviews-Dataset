{"101487":146508,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was deeply and profoundly disappointed in The Last Jedi even though every fiber of my being wanted and expected to enjoy it. \\n  First off\\, the entire story arch of the rebel ship slowly drifting on empty for the whole movie  is ridiculously boring for what's considered to be one of the greatest adventure movie series of all time. Not to mention they begin the movie again like its predecessor completely ignoring any real sense of loss on the side of the Empire. Despite losing the Emperor\\, the Deathstar\\, and a planet sized Starkiller Base with the bulk of their troops and fleet\\, the Empire\/First Order again begins the movie as if nothing has happened and the Empire appears to be just as strong as its ever been.\\n\\nSecond\\, unless the laws of physics suddenly changed\\, there's no gravity is space... So dropping bombs from the rebel bomber ships the way they did was inexplicably lazy writing. And even more ridiculous is having Leia getting blasted into space\\, surviving in space\\, and suddenly using the force to force fly despite never using the force before other than force telepathy... Force push\/pull is a thing in Star Wars but if people can use force pull\/push to make themselves fly then why the hell isn't everyone force flying themselves out of all these bottomless pits everyone falls into in Star Wars?\\n\\nThird\\, Finn\/Rose\/Poe storyline serves no beneficial purpose whatsoever. Rather than Vice Admiral Holdo just telling Poe the plan to let everyone escape to the old rebel base planet and avoid the scanners (that he eventually has no problem with) she for no reason (other than lazy writing) decides to be \\\"mysterious\\\" about her intentions. Because of this stupidity\\, we get sent on a massively useless mission with Finn\\, who could have been given something real\/heroic to do\\, but is instead given even less importance than his already weak role in Force Awakens. To make his side story even duller. he is accompanied by perhaps the least interesting movie character this year\\, Rose (whose \\\"climatic\\\" kiss scene was as boring\/unsatisfying as her character's existence). To top it off\\, while being forced to spend a bulk of time with these two characters on their useless mission\\, we don't even get to see them journey to a unique\/fantastical planet. Instead they are sent to social justice world solely so Rian Johnson can provide his catharsis commentary about hating rich people and Star War's stance on animal cruelty despite it being perfectly fine for Luke and Han to murder a Tauntuan to sleep in just a few episodes ago.\\n\\nFourth Snoke was a Joke. Despite the rhyme I am serious. Force Awakens leads up to him being this mysterious\\, insanely powerful guy behind the scenes pulling all the strings and then gets killed in the in the most anticlimactic way with no capitalization on any character development\/background\/motivation the previous movie setup.\\n\\nFifth\\, Kylo Ren is not nearly interesting\/intimidating enough to be stand as the top bad guy for the remainder of the film. Snoke\\, before being a joke\\, provided much more gravitas\\, sense of threat and mystery to be the evil force behind this episode\/trilogy than Kylo Ren. There is nothing threatening about his character at all\\, unless you're a sympathizer of easily broken set props that are fearful of their ability to withstand Kylo tantrums...\\n\\nSixth\\, Rey (after relentlessly building up the mystery of who she could be and why she curiously has these strange connections to all the old characters)\\, is literally given the least interesting background imaginable (\\\"being no one\\\") after so much development. Now I get it\\, they idea is to make audiences to feel like \\\"Hey I'm no one too! I could be Rey!\\\" and all that crap to make people feel good\\, but to hell with patting everyone on the back if it means destroying one of the only interesting new characters in your franchise. This new revelation compounds on to the blatant problem of both movies so far\\, that Rey has still had no training whatsover and yet still somehow manages to use advanced force techniques like nothing and somehow magically be extemely skilled with a lightsaber...\\n\\nSeventh\\, Captain Phasma is again completely useless other than to sell toys. First movie was marketed like she was going to be some great character\\, but she spoke for a few seconds and literally got thrown in the trash and was presumed dead. Here she's back for another hand full of seconds just to get beaten by the least threatening Stormtrooper in the galaxy\\, despite being the captain that trained millions of troopers... Thankfully she's finally dead unless she miraculously survives again to come back to sell more toys.\\n\\nEighth\\, Luke sucks. Beyond not needing to see him milk the engorged tits of a grotesque creature\\, Luke's character is just all over the place in this film. He says he'll teach Rey\\, then says he only has three lessons which ends up being 1. The Force exists 2. Feel these rocks 3. There was no third lesson.... \\n\\nNinth\\, even though Vice Admiral Holdo's light speed attack provides for beautiful imagery\\, it's immensely stupid in terms of continuity. If you can light speed a basically empty vessel through a massive enemy ship ensuring total destruction with no real casualties on your end\\,  then why the hell hasn't anyone\/everyone been doing that for years to destroy everything? With light speed being in existence for all this time\\, its preposterous to believe no one hadn't thought to do it before.\\n\\nTenth\\, they end the movie with no desire to see the next. They killed off all their characters of note and they severed all character archs from the first movie.","true":true}
