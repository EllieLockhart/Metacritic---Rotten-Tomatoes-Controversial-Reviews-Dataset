Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would love nothing more than to give this 0 stars but it's at least a 2 star movie. The fact that it has a 92% is an abomination and has personally made me stop caring about any future RT score. Watch for yourself and don't let these idiots sway your opinion.","true":true}
