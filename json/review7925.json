Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"extremely credible edition to the saga. its the first star wars film to take chances and it really payoffs. I'm just hopeful JJ can take inspiration and follow suit for the finale. The Last Jedi flirts with light comedy and for the most part its well received. There are a couple of cheesy scenes that should have been cut however for the most part its a fun and give us fans everything we wanted to see. Directing a star wars movie is bit like driving around town in a luxury sports car\\, people will always stop stare even if Mr Bean is behind the wheel. This is not the case for the The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson has delivered","true":true}
