Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely not what I expected and man I'm I glad it wasn't. I love the new direction this movie is taking this franchise. There are a few things I didn't like but thoroughly enjoyed this film and can honestly say it's my second favorite Star Wars movie behind ESB. Loved it.","true":true}
