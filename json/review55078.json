Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked away from this movie thinking \\\"Wow.  That was awesome.\\\"  Then I thought about it... and it's still awesome.\\n\\nIt takes a step in a different direction for the franchise.  A bit darker\\, and using tropes you don't see in movies all that often.\\n\\nIf you like Star Wars you'll enjoy this movie.  So long as you go in expecting it to be different.  And don't be disappointed if your theories are all wrong.  They close out a number of theories I won't get into.  The pacing is great\\, having a nice spacing between action packed scenes with some scenes that are slower\\, but filled with information.  It's a long movie\\, and you can feel that towards the end\\, but only because you're wondering how they're going to slip one last thing into the movie.  \\n\\nOverall.  It's  great.  Dark and unexpected.  It doesn't do what you're used to in Star Wars and personally I find that refreshing.  They don't do fan service just because you want to see it.  They tell the story how they want it to be told and that's fine by me.","true":true}
