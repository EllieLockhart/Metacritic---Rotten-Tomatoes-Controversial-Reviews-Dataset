Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved TLJ\\, yes there are moments that were a little on the lower quality mark but overall as a Star Wars fan all my life it is up there with my favourites. Where some feel characters were ruined\\, I felt they were given more dimensions and their flaws that were ever present in the OG trilogy were highlighted here and new characters grew stronger and took the stage.","true":true}
