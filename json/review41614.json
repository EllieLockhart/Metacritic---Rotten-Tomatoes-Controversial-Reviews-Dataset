Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is THE worst movie ever. It makes me so mad how Rian Johnson \\\"subverted expectations\\\". Just dumb\/lazy writing from someone who doesn't get star wars. I've honestly tried to give this movie a chance. I'm not going to see the rise of Skywalker.","true":true}
