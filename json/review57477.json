Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was the worst Star Wars film I've even had the misfortune of viewing. \\nFrom a cinematograph point of view the film looks amazing and for the most part it feels like the Star Wars universe.\\nThe problem is the script\\, it's weak and strangely paced. It does nothing for old or new cast members\\, either sending them on slow strange side missions or throwing them away completely.\\nThe film seems to have a war is hell vibe\\, which feels strange when this is a sci-fi fantasy film\\, this isn't Dunkirk (though there is an odd sequence with Resistance bombers that looks like its straight out of a film like that)\\nOnly a Sith deals in absolutes\\, but frankly this was absolutely awful and I won't be seeing the Solo movie or Ep. 9.\\nn.b. I enjoy Rian Johnson as a director and like some of his other films such as Looper and Brick (not the brothers bloom\\, that's bad)\\, no idea why this was so bad.","true":true}
