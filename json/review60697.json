The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"To start off this review\\, id love to imply immediately\\, that this game is not even a top 10 game contender for the GoTY award\\, not in a million years\\, lets be honest\\, this year. Those who rate it 9 and above are clearly bad reviewers or bots\\, because you have to clearly be blind not to see any mistakes at all. ill begin with why i chose 4 and not 0.

Those who rate it 9 and above are clearly bad reviewers or bots\\, because you have to clearly be blind not to see any mistakes at all. ill begin with why i chose 4 and not 0. The gameplay was amazing and the design\\, artwork\\, further on\\, graphics were gorgeous\\, you can't deny it\\, so how do you ever come with a statement of a rating being below 2? Half a point for characteristics and biography\\, because half of it made sense and logic and the other half was poorly writen **** and im a good **** detector at poker\\, reference included. Spoiler alert further on\\, to just come up with such a dumb story line for Joel's death is disrespectful for the character itself and the fanbase\\, shame on you\\, especially not even taking the responsability for it aswell. I mean seriously\\, the death of another poor souls father which is a doctor is too poorly written\\, especially when the girl\\, if she even was told\\, knew his name\\, and name only. So im supposed to understand that she traveled the entire USA\\, looking and calling out every guy named Joel\\, alive or dead\\, and killing every person named Joel. Im sorry for swearing\\, but for **** sake\\, i ain't no detective\\, but you sure as hell need to know more ablut the person\\, and i sure as hell know\\, no one in that hospital knows Joel at all\\, or how he even looks like\\, or where he went. Enough about this\\, everyone who rated below 6 was smart enough to understand that. Now\\, everyone hates when the game does not allow the person to choose on anything or isn't allowed to try and do something about something\\, especially during the ending\\, and yall know which ending im talking about. We were \\\"used\\\" in this game for nothing in the end\\, waiting for that something\\, which we never ever got or will even get close to. Basically the game was about nothing but knowing that\\, spoiler alert\\, Joel dies. They even forced us to play with the character we hate later on\\, disgusting. Might aswell create a new rating\\, hey ESBN\\, here is a new suggestion\\, \\\"forced torture\\\"\\, how does that sound? Im amazed this studio is even writing or speaking anymore to it's fanbase\\, they are lucky\\, they aren't in the Bethesda's Fallout 76's spot... yet.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
