Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't care for it at all. It was a filler movie. Barely any information I was looking for was given in the movie. And only the last 1\/3 of the movie was even worth watching.","true":true}
