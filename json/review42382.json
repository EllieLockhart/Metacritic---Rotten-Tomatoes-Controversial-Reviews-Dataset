Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a bold and fresh move that set up some amazing character arch's and unexpected twists. It's not without its problems but the bigger picture is so well crafted and it has the best cinematic shot in the Star Wars canon.","true":true}
