Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could rank it lower I would. I felt nothing watching this movie. There was no tension throughout the ridiciulous  two and a half hour runtime. It's pretty clear the execs behind this had no idea what they were doing and didn't plan for future films to tie up loose ends. I'm not sure if Disney set out to butcher Star Wars\\, but they did one bang up job of it.","true":true}
