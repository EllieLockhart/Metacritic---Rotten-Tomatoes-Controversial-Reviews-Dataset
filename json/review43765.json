{"101487":188488,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever written. There were so many plot holes in The Force Awakens\\, but the benefit of the doubt was given to J.J. Abrahams and Disney simply because fans thought that those questions would be answered in the sequels. The Last Jedi does not answer questions\\, but instead brings up more questions into how any of this story makes sense. Spoiler warning for this review. \\n\\nThe first question is a major one about the main character and what she is in this story other than a perfect example on why feminism has ruined story telling. Rey is portrayed as borderline flawless that she is the embodiment of a Mary Sue in a fanfiction. In fact\\, Rey is so perfect in everything she does that there is no reason to root for her\\, she doesn't give you anything to look forward to\\, she can just use the force perfectly without having to train just because that is what the writers tell you. For those who are not Star Wars fans\\, imagine if your favorite sports athlete or musician never trained a day in their life\\, would they have been able to just pick up a football and immediately be a pro athlete\\, or touch a piano and be able to play Mozart in a concert? The answer is a resounding no\\, and that is why so many Star Wars fans have been complaining about this character. Throughout the Star Wars universe\\, every Jedi or Sith had to train in order to become as powerful as they were. It is true that there were prodigy's like Anakin or Luke\\, but even they had to train to control the power of the force. The Last Jedi was supposed to tell us\\, the viewers\\, why Rey was so perfect in the first movie that she was able to outclass Ben Solo who was trained by Luke Skywalker and a powerful Sith Lord\\, but instead it was a huge let down to find out that there are no answers for her power and that every one's criticism about her being so perfect was justified. At least George Lucas managed to make Anakin Skywalker flawed in the prequels\\, in that regard he far exceeded the storytelling in comparison to these new movies.\\n \\nI felt so bad for Mark Hamill in this movie\\, but even worse for Luke Skywalker. What they turned Luke into was despicable and is not justice for who and what Luke Skywalker once was. Luke Skywalker wasn't just a hero\\, but a legend. Almost everyone knew who his name\\, and even those who hadn't watched the movies or weren't fans of Star Wars had at the very least heard of him before. That farmer boy who grew up to become a Jedi Knight was a character development that would be told for generations that parents would share to their children\\, until the release of The Last Jedi that is. Disney has to ask themselves whether or not this was the Luke Skywalker that we once watched\\, the one who believed in the teachings of an old man by faith alone\\, the same Luke that was willingly fly on a suicide mission even though he didn't have to because he believed there was a cause worth fighting for\\, the Luke Skywalker that would knowingly die for his friends\\, that Luke who would risk his very own life to save his corrupted father whom he barely knew from the dark side because he believed there was still good in him. Luke Skywalker was a courageous\\, selfless boy who in the beginning had many flaws\\, but the fans loved him for it because overcame those flaws and learned from his mistakes to become the Jedi master he was known for. Was that the Luke that was portrayed in this movie? I cannot stress how much this Luke Skywalker goes against everything the character is and what he stood for. Mark Hamill should have never agreed to this movie.\\n\\nBen Solo was a whiny duckling in The Force Awakens\\, and in The Last Jedi he grew up to be an even whinier duckling. I don't know how they could've made this character look any worse\\, just when I thought they were about to take a turn where Rey turns Ben around and throw in some good character development in\\, they do the unthinkable and make him even worse. The closer Ben gets to the dark side\\, the cringer he became. In every scene he looks like a child who is about to throw a tantrum \\n(he does) because he didn't get what he wanted at the store. It is like the directors told the actor if he could act whinier than Anakin did in the prequels. Perhaps in the new Star Wars universe\\, it is now required for Dark Lords to be a three-year-old at heart. Maybe in a sequel\/prequel\/spinoff\/money milker\\, Disney can get Ben and Anakin together so they can compete to find out who can throw the best \\\"I hate sand\\\" tantrum. \\n\\nWhen everyone asked\\, \\\"who is Snoke?\\\" the writers said\\, \\\"we don't care\\,\\\" and that is all they wrote. Snoke was an extremely powerful Sith lord with no other character development or backstory\\, he is just kind of there because the writers needed a plot device. How did a Sith as powerful as Snoke fall under the radar throughout all six prequel movies\\, that was a question that many Star Wars fans were all hoping an answer for but never got. It is apparent that storytelling and continuity doesn't matter to Disney so long as the movie will make them money. Basically\\, if these movies didn't have Snoke in them\\, it wouldn't have made any difference to the story at all.  \\n\\nI swear\\, if there was one more \\\"we are right\\\" metaphor in this movie\\, I was going to throw my popcorn at the screen. They just had to shove down the audience's throats how the rebels... sorry\\, \\\"resistance\\\" are the beacons of everything that is good in the universe without explaining why that is. In the original Star Wars\\, the rebels were fighting the Galactic Empire which was a tyrannical dictatorship\\, but the rebels weren't all in the audience's face about it acting like they were doing it all for fame and glory\\, but because they knew it was the right thing to do which made them the good guys. The resistance on the other hand are way too full of themselves\\, they have so many cringe worthy speeches about being the light that everyone will follow (even though nobody does)\\, it honestly makes them appear as bad as The Last Order only on opposite sides and with famous names like Luke and Leia with them which makes the audience think that they are the good guys\\, but take the old Star Wars characters out of the resistance and the \\\"we are the cool kids\\\" undertones will becomes more apparent.  \\n\\nJust like with Snoke\\, how did The Last Order fall under the radar of not only from Luke Skywalker\\, but the entire Republic as well? One would imagine that the Republic have some power in the galaxy\\, and would've had operatives just about everywhere that should have been able to sniff out The Last Order which wasn't just building a planet sized Death Star\\, but an entire fleet of giant galactic warships. Everything that the Empire built\\, The Last Order built it bigger and better without having nearly as much power and control over the galaxy. This is another major plot hole that needed to be explained but never was. Where was the Republic preventing The Last Order from gaining as much power as they did\\, why did Luke Skywalker run away from The Last Order when he was brave enough to take on the much bigger Empire\\, if Luke Skywalker knew about The Last Order\\, why did he not go before the Republic to ask for help in fighting them off before they could build a planet sized Death Star? Nothing about The Last Order makes any sense other than the fact that having a villain just like the Empire back is a cash grab in the eyes of Disney. \\nIn the end\\, The Last Jedi just proved the critics who found all the plot holes in The Force Awakens were right all along. This doesn't even touch on space Leia\\, the countless near-death scenes\\, how the traitor in the story managed to contact The Last Order\\, the awful Finn and Rose subplot\\, and the Knights of Ren. However\\, I finally figured what Disney wanted to do with these movies\\, they are trying to completely erase all we have known about Star Wars to build it up in their image. This is why they destroyed the Republic in the blink of an eye because it doesn't fit with their narrative\\, and why the once brave and selfless Luke Skywalker had become a cowardly hermit\\, this is why they continuously talk about getting rid of the Sith and the Jedi because the old must come to an end to make way for the new Disney Star Wars. Disney doesn't want the fans to think about the first six movies the same way anymore\\, they are rewriting the Star Wars universe in their image\\, and these movies are how they will do it. The continuity of Star Wars is finished\\, and George Lucas should be ashamed of himself for selling the rights of Star Wars to the true evil Empire in the universe.","true":true}
