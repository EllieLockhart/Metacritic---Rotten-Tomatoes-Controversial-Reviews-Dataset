Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Positives - Luke and Rey's scenes - Kylo and Rey's connection - Snokes scenes\/ satisfying death - the force - Carrie fishers performance -action - Yoda scene - Rey's parents being nobody's - lightsaber duels Negatives - Finn and rose storyline - no build up to threat - a little to many separated story's 8\/10","true":true}
