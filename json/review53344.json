Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deplorable and egregious continuation to the force awakens. It is clear that a multiple director\/writer approach has debilitated this saga. Many of the plot points I was looking forward to being explored were abandoned\\, and substituted with random sub-plots that add no substance to the lore\\, or explore the characters in a meaningful way. They simply existed\\, I would say 45 minutes of this film could have been cut out and it would have been inconsequential to the main story line. This is a shame\\, considering that there is never a scene where Luke and Ray are training\\, there are no light saber fights\\, and the essence of star wars is simply missing. I walked away feeling like I had just watched another side movie like Rogue One. Not sure how they plan on expanding this trilogy\\, but  I am considerably less enthused to watch the final film after this.","true":true}
