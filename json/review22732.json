{"101487":150091,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"List of why WE hated the Last Jedi\\n\\n- All the plot holes\\n- All the ex machina moments\\n- The terrible disney jokes\\n- Useless product placement for porgs\\n- Casino scene that did nothing to story\\n- Superleia and logic behind that scene\\n- Wasting of Snoke and Phasma\\n- Fucking up Hux\\n- That idiotic bomber scene at the start\\n- The movie felt like a parody\\, they literally took star wars and let mark hamil throw it over his shoulder. And had a \\\"marvel\\\" movie feel to it\\, full of unnecessary jokes in situations that should be serious.\\n-  The director and writer decited to ignore half of what was set up in the force awakens. The knights of ren\\, ray's parents\\, plagueis' mystery\\, etc.\\n- Plot\\, The entire reason for why the Finn & Rose plot was happening was because miss purple hair didn't tell their crew that they had a plan. The only reason she did that was because the movie would have been over if she did\\, I mean if that isn't bad writing I don't know what is.\\n- This was in the force awakens as well\\, Ray being a \\\"god\\\" basically.\\n- have you heard the story of darth plagueis the wise? perhaps no\\, cuz the director made it NONCANNON","true":true}
