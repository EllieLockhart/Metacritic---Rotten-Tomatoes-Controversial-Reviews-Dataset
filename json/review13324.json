Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed 2 scenes from the movie. The throne room fight and the admiral's final hoorah. The rest of it was just not good. The opening scene causes me to have no fear of the first order. They are easily manipulated morons. Poe should have been arrested. The admiral should have informed the crew of the plan. What was the point of Finn? Phasma? Rose would have been better not in the movie. Rey didnt help. She didn't inspire hope. And the person that should have didnt even show up in person. Awful movie.","true":true}
