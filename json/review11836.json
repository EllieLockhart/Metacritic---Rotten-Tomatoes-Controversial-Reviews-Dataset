Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How \\\"top critics\\\" can call this one of the best Star Wars movies of all time is beyond me. This has got to me one of the worst movies of all time with the only entertaining scene being when Kylo Ren and Rey fight the guards together. Space Vegas was just so irrelevant to the little plot the movie had.","true":true}
