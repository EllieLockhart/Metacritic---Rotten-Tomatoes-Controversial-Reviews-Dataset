Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, convoluted\\, and absolutely exhausting. I wanted to leave 30 minutes in but forced (lol) myself to stay hoping the film would turn a corner. It never did. It was little more than a bad Marvel Star Wars movie.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Kylo (Adam Driver was outstanding and his scenes were the best in the film).\\n- That one explosion.\\n- Porgs.\\n\\nCons:\\n- \\\"Oh hey! The force can do all sorts of stuff we never thought to mention before in any other movie!\\\"\\n- The Leia thing.\\n- The Luke thing.\\n- Hawkes\\n- Snoke\\n- Casino planet.\\n- Everything that happened on that stupid island.\\n- Poe's wisecracks (the writing in general)\\n\\nLast bit: I know it's a Star Wars movie and Star Wars movies don't care about science\\, reality\\, or consistency\\, but space doesn't work that way.","true":true}
