Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you thought the story of TFA was mismanaged then this sequel really relieves any of that\\, and seems to throw away any sensible character development\\, even for the characters that weren't pushed off to the side.","true":true}
