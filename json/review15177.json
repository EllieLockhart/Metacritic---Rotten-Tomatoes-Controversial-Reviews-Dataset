Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it on first watch but then i started to think about it and realized that it just dosnt make sense the character action the plot  how everything goes down \\,there is no logic to it \\,just pointless","true":true}
