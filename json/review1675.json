Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an action movie set in space\\, this is a decent movie with some good action scenes. As the 8th entry in the main Star Wars series\\, this movie is just awful. Not only did they drop all relevant plot lines from the previous movie\\, they managed to ruin one of the most beloved characters in all of cinema. Luke\\, I am sorry for what they did to you.","true":true}
