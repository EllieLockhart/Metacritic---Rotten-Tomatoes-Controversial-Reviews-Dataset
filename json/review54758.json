Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I stayed away from ALL trailers and pre-film content prior to my first viewing.\\n\\nCinematography was nice\\, but you can get that from a thousand other movies. I don't go see a Star Wars film because I'm excited to see the cinematography. I go because I'm invested in the fantastic world full of different alien cultures\\, weird technology\\, and massive galactic scale.\\n\\nThis movie did not provide that at all. It was\\, in my opinion\\, a catastrophic failure in terms of world building. Not only did we receive very few new additions to the lore\\, but some of the additions actually damage existing and future lore. Being able to track hyperspace jumps and being able jump into an enemy ship raise a plethora of questions which I won't get in to.\\n\\nOf course\\, I realize that not everybody prioritizes world-building as much as I do. I don't hold it against anybody\\, but this is my #1 reason for disliking the film.\\n\\nMy other criticism is that the humor was inappropriate. I'm not saying that the jokes were bad\\, I thought many of them were hilarious\\, but the timing was often terrible. For example\\, Luke brushing his shoulder at the climax? Completely stomped the hype I had seeing him emerge from that cloud of smoke. The weird alien titty scene was beyond out of place. I wouldn't be surprised if Disney gave Rian Johnson some contractual obligation to put 1 joke in for every 10 minutes of film time and he decided to do some malicious compliance.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nI avoided all TLJ-related content before watching. I didn't like the film because it had arguably the worst world building of the entire franchise and the humor\\, while being funny\\, often killed the mood of a scene with poor timing.","true":true}
