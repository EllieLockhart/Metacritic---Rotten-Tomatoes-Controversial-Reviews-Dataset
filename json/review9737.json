Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good to see that the First order is so powerful that they can build mega stuff one after another! Making so much sense that that 60km stuff can't even penetrate the rebel ship's shield. The resistance is so stupid that they can only find one safe house for them to hide. Everything makes \\\"so much\\\" sense in it\\, including Snoke and Phasma. Poor Brienne of Tarth!\\nAlso\\, everything is so familiar including killing the master and \\\"return\\\" to the light and battle of \\\"Hoth\\\". Star Wars fans are not idiots\\, Darth Disney!","true":true}
