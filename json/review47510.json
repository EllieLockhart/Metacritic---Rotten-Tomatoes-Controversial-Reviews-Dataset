Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What kind of world are we living in when the storyline\\, plot and character development of Star Wars\\, arguably the most iconic action\/adventure movie of our time\\, bend to the will of a 3rd wave feminist agenda?    Because the original movies weren't liberal enough?  The male characters in this movie embody the four male horseman of the feminist-narrative apocylpse  - Abandonment (Luke)\\, Evil Ambition (Kylo Ren)\\, Reckless Cowboy (Po) and Cowardly Bumbler (Finn).  The women on the other hand are comically flawless saints.  Ray\\, with no more than a few hours of Jedi training\\, easily bests Luke Skywalker\\, rivals Kylo Ren and demonstrates not a single character flaw.  Admiral Holdo rules over the male soldiers of the rebellion and re-educates them\\, and us\\, in the art of combat: male heroism in war is but a selfish\\, juveline impulse to blow stuff up.  If only we could have benefitted from her wisdom in World War II.  All of Po's efforts\\, and indeed the last hope for any positive male contribution to the story\\, serve instead to set the rebellion back.  The men act with 'toxic masculinity' and cowardice and the women sacrifice nobly to clean up their mess.   The bombadeer dies as a result of Po's boyish behavior.  (Though it serves her right to be dropping 'bombs' in zero-gravity\\,)  Her sister has to stop Finn from running away in fear.  Leia has to join the purple-haired transparently feminist Holdo\\, her apparent lesbian lover\\, in re-educating their star pilot to refrain from his childish obsession with shooting at the enemy.  Please make it stop!!  And all of this injected into an action\/adventure science fiction war saga!  No punishment is too severe for those that decided to consecrate the Star Wars franchise  to accomplish their hate-fueled agenda of belittling men\\, or for those that acquiesced to them.  For the record\\, I'm a life-long bleeding-heart liberal who wanted Elizabeth Warren to run for president.  This is more than a bad movie.  It's a wake-up call to all of us about the tyrannical levels of power the SJWs currenty wield.","true":true}
