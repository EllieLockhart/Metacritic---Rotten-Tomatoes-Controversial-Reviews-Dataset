Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From start to end\\, this film felt like a direct assault against the established Star Wars lore from the previous films. Instead of building up on the previous films\\, Rian Johnson's monstrosity of a film seems intent on destroying the saga's rich legacy and creating something new and ugly.","true":true}
