Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst! \\n\\nThere are so many plot holes and character mistakes\\, it is as though whoever wrote this script either had never seen a star wars movie or just didn't give a crap!\\n\\nLuke would never behave like he did\\, he would never had thought in murdering his sister's and best m8's  only child. Luke once tried to see the good in the most evil man in the galaxy\\, but now he just gives up? Makes no sense. \\n\\nThere are just too many faults to mention in this poorly written move\\, from the character destruction to the respective broken thin plot\\, they successfully killed Star Wars!
