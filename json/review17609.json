Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I started an account just to say this about the last Jedi. If you want to see a movie that a SJW\\, a Chinese communist propagandist and a feminist get together to make a movie and the only thing that resembles Star Wars is the title go see this movie you will love it. It shows men being submissive bitches and complete losers it will suck out every ounce of soul and hope out of the audience. It's almost like they just wantth a movie to shot on men and Star Wars and they totally accomplished that. We need to teach Disney a lesson I am boycotting all their games EA games battlefront 2 and merchandise as well the next movie I will wait till I hear reviews before I go see it all my friends agree China basically insulted Americans. I give Star Wars the last Jedi tge worst movie ever made.","true":true}
