Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had the dialog on an 80s action movie that went straight to VHS. The way everything was added was a failure\\, new technology? Implemented terribly\\, new force powers? Implemented terribly. Key death scenes? implemented extremely poorly.  Unanswered questions? Who cares just say something in an line a dialog to make the person asking the question feel foolish. These critics who rated this must have been brided. This movie is on par with the Sharknado series.","true":true}
