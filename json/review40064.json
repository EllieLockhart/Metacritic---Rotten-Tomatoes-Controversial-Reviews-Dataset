Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my personal third favorite Star Wars film behind Empire and the original. I think the direction was well crafted\\, the cinematography was beautiful\\, they expanded on the lore in a really interesting way\\, and they also expanded on the character of Luke really well from the sweet kid we knew from the originals\\, to a man who has been through trauma. My only problem with this is the Finn and Rose subplot. Other than that\\, I love this movie. I think it's a great expansion on the Skywalker saga\\, and also just a great film in general. \\n     I think a lot of Star Wars fans go overboard with hating this movie because they do new things that weren't expected. However\\, when Episode XII came out\\, fans complained that it was too much of the same. I think this is a beautiful and emotioal continuation and expansion of the galaxy far far away.","true":true}
