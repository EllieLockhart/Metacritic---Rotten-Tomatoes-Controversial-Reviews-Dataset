Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't sure how I felt when I first saw the film but there are some powerful themes that come through like a slow burn once you start thinking about the film and giving it time to process - although I don't want to give spoilers away. In regards to the poor reviews many users have given it I would say that many people complained about TFA\\, which I think is a fine film\\, for being a mimic of ANH. TLJ is a bold movie on the other hand\\, and that's what Star Wars films are meant to be.","true":true}
