Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just not Star Wars and made it hard for its sequel to succeed. It also has a negative affect on Solo. If you thought the prequels were bad this is just a whole new level of bad. The comedy makes Jar Jar look good. If only JJ Abrams did the whole trilogy imagine what it could have become.","true":true}
