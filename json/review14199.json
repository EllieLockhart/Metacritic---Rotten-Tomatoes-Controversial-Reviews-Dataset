Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely enjoyed the movie.  There were a few plot lines to navigate\\, but the depth and pacing seemed adept.  Getting more back story on Snope would have great.  I suspect the back story on Rey will be adjusted in the next movie.\\n\\nThe introduction of Porg will infuse merchandising interest\\, but was a quick and somewhat disturbing return to the Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
