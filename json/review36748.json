Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie looks great and was filmed well\\, but that end of the positives. The movie purposefully throws away all pre-established plot points from the previous movie and changing both how the world is fundamentally set up and how the lore within the universe works and interacts with the world around it\\, but this is obviously a small point when considering the movie on its own\\, the more glaring issues are that throughout the movie their are innumerable plot holes and inconsistencies\\, having entire side plots that are completely and utterly meaningless\\, as well as having repeated points where the movie goes completely against its self and sets up conflicts and interactions that make no sense at the time and make even less sense after they have resolved\\, leaving the entire movie in a confused and utterly abysmal mess.","true":true}
