The game was really disappointing for me as a fan of the first one. After I saw the leaks I lowered my expectations and even with my low expectations the game got even worse than I thought. I'm still disappointed by the lazy writing of the Story especially how they handled Joel's death. Tommy and Joel wouldn't be so dumb to reveal their identities to complete strangers especially when they wear uniforms of a miliyary group which doesn't operate in the area of Jackson. There is literally no reason for them two trust the armed group of strangers. I can understand that Abby wants revenge but let's be honest her father was a moron of a doctor who had such a big ego that he wanted to kill a teenager to make a cure. He as a doctor should know that a vaccine for a fungal infection hasn't been achieved with the resources they had before the outbreak. There is literally no chance for a vaccine. And if it would be possible the dumbest thing to do would be to kill the only human known to be immune. Also it's kinda his own fault wanting to kill a girl without consent and to threaten someone who is heavy armoured person with a scalpel. You don't bring a knife to a gunfight. And Abby knows that her dad was willing to kill a girl without her knowing she would die. Many people said the context of the leaks were important. But holy **** it made the game worse. The gameplay was okayisch but at the point where we switch to play as Abby I just wanted the game to end. Story was **** and gameplay got boring. Tlou2 is the first game that made me to switch difficulty to just run through it to get to the end. The end wasn't worth playing to be honest but I was glad the game was over. The game looks beutiful and has many details though. Also the soundtrack is really good like last time. These are the only reasons I give 3 points to this game. Wouldn't recommend fans of the first game to play it. Others might enjoy it more....\u2026 Expand","true":true}
