Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw Star Wars last Jedi.\\nNot very good they're killing the franchise.\\nToo long\\, never answer any questions from the last movie. Reys origins is a let down. The first time I literally dozed off in a Star Wars movie. Certain characters did die and the Force can be learned in less than a day. One nice cameo of a older character came back that had nothing to do with the storyline.\\nThey should've used George Lucas original script.","true":true}
