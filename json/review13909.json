Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a true fan of Star Wars. This is the worst movie ever. Thank you Disney for making a movie that could only interest 2 year olds. There is no story in this movie. Star Wars is not equip and joke every 2 seconds and that is what this movie is. Disney has ruined Star Wars with this movie.","true":true}
