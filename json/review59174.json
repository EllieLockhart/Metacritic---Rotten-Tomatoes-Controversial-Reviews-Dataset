It pains me to say\\, you failed. Abysmally.\r\rI truly feel Naughty Dog have broken TLOU for us and destroyed all the emotional attachment we had with Ellie going into TLOU Part 2. We all knew Joel was likely to die. Even before the leaks (which I swear I never read). So many YouTubers had already predicted it and Neil had said TLOU2 was going to be all about Ellie. It was barely that. 50% of it was a pointless grind of the new gameplay\/mechanics and characters aka Abby. Come on guys\\, Abby was just back-story.\r\rIn my honest opinion\\, the game was a jumbled mess. Too much flip-flopping back and forward in time. Joel was killed too early\\, the Abby playtime should have been shorter as we all just wanted to get through it and get back to playing Ellie.\r\rSo much of the story could have been played in a different sequence and have the same effect. Hell we could have even played as a Seraphite !!\r\rTLOU2 just wasn't as engaging. It didn't draw you in like the first game\\, it didn't get inside you and create the same emotional bond\/attachment. Simply put\\, the story telling was AWFUL.\rEnvironments 10\/10  Mechanics 9.9\/10  AI 9\/10  Music 10\/10  Story 1\/10  Characters 8\/10  Transitions 11\/10 (best ever) Gameplay 9\/10  Melee 10\/10\r\rWTFH was that final fight with Abby in the water all about ?? Plain dumb and felt very rushed.\rTLOU was a true masterpiece. This had all the components for a fantastic part 2 building on what the first game started but ultimately fails to deliver.\r\rGreat gameplay and graphics never make up for a poor story. I felt more engaged with Uncharted 4 than TLOU Part 2. This game just reminded me how good the first game was and isn't the PS4's swansong in the way I hoped it would be.\r\rFirst game draws you and pulls all your emotional strings. TLOU Part 2 seems to shove stuff in your face and expect you to be absorbed. It fails.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
