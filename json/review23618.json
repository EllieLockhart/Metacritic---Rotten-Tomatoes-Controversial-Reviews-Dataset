Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVE LOVE LOVED it! I have been a Star Wars fan since first watching episodes 4\\, 5\\, & 6 when I was a little girl. I was less than enthused with episodes 1\\, 2\\, & 3. When The force awakens came out I was excited about the direction they were going in and haven't been disappointed a bit by The Last Jedi. Will any new Star Wars live up to the original three? It would be very hard if not impossible\\, but this movie is well made\\, has a great story line\\, and really fits with the original trilogy. Well done!","true":true}
