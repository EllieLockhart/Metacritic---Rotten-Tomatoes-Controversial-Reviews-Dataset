Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looks to me that a vocal minority of \u201creal fans\u201d are trying to push the scores down. This ain\u2019t a great movie. But Star Wars was never mean to be great art. And this was a fun day out for all the family. Everyone I\u2019ve spoken to enjoyed it. ","true":true}
