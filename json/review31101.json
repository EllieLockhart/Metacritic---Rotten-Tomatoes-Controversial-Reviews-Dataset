Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So let's be clear\\, the visuals and music were astonishing. I also am perfectly fine with risks and changes with a series now headed into a 3rd trilogy. This though\\, this couldn't even be considered a good movie by normal standards. Did it make a lot of money? Of course\\, it's Star Wars for goodness sake. I myself had heard of its terrible reviews\\, but still went and saw it\\, so obviously these critics boasting \\\"it's a great success\\\" because of the gross profit it has earned is absurd. There's more plot holes in this movie than holes in the damn movie \\\"holes\\\" itself. There's a way to shift a series from one legacy to another\\, it's called transitioning...not butchering everything\\, and especially everyone\\, we knew from the series. I wanted to like this\\, I wanted to see it from a new perspective\\, but come on\\, let's not kid ourselves..this was bad. There are moments of true Star Wars nostalgia and some awesome parts\\, but it's littered with so many problems and thrown plot-lines that I can hardly call this a story. It's like a group of people got together and each decided to carry on a story piece by piece without any fluidity. Moment after moment I found myself saying\\, \\\"well couldn't they have just done that?\\\"\\, or \\\"was that really necessary?\\\". I remain optimistic for the future of Star-Wars\\, but this movie is forever lost to me. I will never watch it again...you can believe me on that.","true":true}
