Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the Force Awakens all I wanted to do is see Po kick some ass in an x-wing some more but instead I have one fight scene with some red ninja knights in a red background room and the porgs had more back story than all the heroes\/villains combined.","true":true}
