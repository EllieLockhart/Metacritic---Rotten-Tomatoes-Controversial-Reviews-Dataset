Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the most interesting movie to come out of the Star Wars Saga. This can be a real home run for this film\\, but also can be at its determent. Kylo is by far the best part of this new trilogy\\, but seeing Luke again was quite amazing. The film often has subplots that are not nearly as interesting or entertaining as the Rey\/Kylo\/Luke stories. Overall a good movie\\, but not a great Star Wars film.","true":true}
