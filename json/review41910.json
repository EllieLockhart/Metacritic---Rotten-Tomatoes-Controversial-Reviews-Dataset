Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is weak. I had such high hopes for this franchise\\, but instead of mining the rich mythology for a new and compelling story we are stuck with plodding nonsense plot\\, emasculated heroes\\, another wasted super powered villain\\, and winning \\\"supreme commander. There were some inspiring moments punctuated by flattening humor and overwhelming doubt and disappointment. This movie was simply confusing mess. You'd be better off staying home and watching the un-digitally altered originals.","true":true}
