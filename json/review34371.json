Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bad things about The Force Awakens are still in this movie and now\\, even more noticeable. The good things are still in the movie\\, at least most of them. This film is funnier than all the previous\\, BUT doesn't take it self as serious as it should\\, from times to times. This is not one of these films you want to rewatch over and over. It's too long\\, and even though it's just about 15 minutes longer then the past one\\, it felt like sitting there for hours.\\n The film was also a bit to complicated\\, mostly for people that haven't watched the other films more then once or twice. But over all\\, the film was above the okay level. It was worth the money I spent on the ticket.","true":true}
