Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't hate this movie - I don't want to because I love Star Wars with a passion. That's why this movie just made me so miserably sad. \\nI generally enjoyed The Force Awakens. I found the worlds it showed mostly boring and uninspired but I liked the basic premise of these fresh young characters it set up and the potential of the story that was to come out of it.\\nTo say I was disappointed would be a gigantic understatement. Not only did this movie (literally and figuratively) fling away any hopes I had for it\\, it also changed even well established and beloved things and characters from the earlier films for no other reason than furthering its own weak and utterly flawed narrative. \\nOne can only hope that this insidious display of ignorance was a one time slip. If not\\, fans of the franchise will find themselves in a position like that of Obi Wan Kenobi\\, looking down on the crippled corpse of the thing they once loved slowly getting consumed by flames. I do want to believe that\\, as the stories want us to believe\\, there indeed is redemption for everyone\\, even for franchises like this after turning as bad as this\\, however\\, our world isn't a movie where the good always wins. That's why I can't help but feel sadness.","true":true}
