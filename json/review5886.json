Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing doesn\u2019t begin to describe this movie. I\u2019m not a Star Wars fan to the point of directing every little piece of them all looking for errors. A child of the 1970\u2019s\\, I love Star Wars and movies in general so I\u2019m pretty easy to entertain. I didn\u2019t overhype the movie or give it unachievable expectations. It was just a disappointing movie. Boring\\, 60 min too long with too many moments where most people are shaking their head in the theatre asking \u201cWTF?\u201d Movie critics today are like election pollsters\\, so out of touch with the people that they would give this a 92% score! Wait for video for this one. ","true":true}
