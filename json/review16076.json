Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm an avid Star Wars fan\\, I've been obsessed with everything Star Wars since I was 8 years old. This movie completely shat on everything these films stood for and logic. I've never reviewed a film on Rotten Tomatoes or any other social media before but this film left me so angry and heart broken I actually couldn't bring myself not to reflect on how poorly this trilogy has been handled. JJ set up the potential to hit a home run with the retrospective Force awakens but Rian has ignored fans and made a film that killed off the magic that was Star Wars. I award you zero points and may god have mercy on your soul. CAVEAT: I love all your other films Rian\\, what happened Mate?","true":true}
