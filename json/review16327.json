Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im not sure why everyone is hating on this movie so much yes is has a few major down points for example the \\\"flying Leia\\\" scene was unnecessary and the Canto bight scenes were drawn out to much. However I feel one of the main reasons people hate this movie is the direction they took Luke's character in which to me was actually one of the movies good points it gives the character a more natural and real feel to him\\, he has created this training school which he loves and wants to create a new generation of Jedi and he can sense that one pupil (Ben Solo) is going to turn to the dark side and possibly destroy everything he has worked towards and in the moment Luke wants to kill Ben before he can destroy everything\\, lets be honest if you knew someone was going to destroy everything you've worked hard towards you would do anything to protect it showing Luke is just like everyone else it also shows he still has part of Vader in him but everyone seems to hate this because they want Luke to be the perfect hero and they are blinded by there love for him that they dont understand Luke is a human being NO ONE IS PERFECT","true":true}
