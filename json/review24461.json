Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More than anything\\, this movie takes the Star Wars story in a new and interesting direction. A lot of what was set up in The Force Awakens pays off in unexpected ways this time\\, but it all flows naturally from who the characters are and the situations they are in. The action is amazing\\, The Last Jedi has some of the best action set pieces the series has ever seen and they all feel earned and flows from the characters that are involved in them and the emotions that are at play. The first half may feel a bit slow but its all building toward a cohesive thematic point about power structures and lineage\/ inherited power that really comes together by the end. It still feels like Star Wars\\, in the good way\\, but also fresh and new\\, in a way The Force Awakens didn't really. Personally\\, I would rate this as the best Star Wars movie made since the turn of the millennium.","true":true}
