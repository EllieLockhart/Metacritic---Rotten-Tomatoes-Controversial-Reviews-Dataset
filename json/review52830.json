Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people seem angry that this movie didn't play out the way they wanted\\, and are giving it terrible reviews because of it. Not to say this movie is without faults (flying Leia\\, and dropping bombs in space)\\, but the fact that everything is this movie was unpredictable\\, and the subtle character arcs that completely change the course of the story\\, make it one of my favorite Star Wars movies yet.","true":true}
