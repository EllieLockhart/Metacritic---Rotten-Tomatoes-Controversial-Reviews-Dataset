Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. And I would much rather have all those old books back as canon than have this be Luke's fate. So many questions never answered\\, so much Skywalker history yet explored\\, and so much disappointment for further character development. It made me feel the opposite of the excitement and rush from The Force Awakens.","true":true}
