Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see where there are a lot of fans unhappy with the new direction this movie has taken the series\\, but to be honest\\, that made it all the more enjoyable to me. It builds on the original mythos and expands it's potential.\\n\\nThe parts that ruined it for me were some aspects of cinematography\\, which while they've become commonplace in modern film\\, just don't seem to belong in a franchise such as star wars (slow mo\\, flashback\\, etc).","true":true}
