Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hope the next movie gives us more answers. Don\u2019t know how I feel about this movie right now. I loved rogue one from the start but this movie makes me feel uneasy about the franchise. ","true":true}
