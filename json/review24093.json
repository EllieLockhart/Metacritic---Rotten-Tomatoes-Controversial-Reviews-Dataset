Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive plot holes\\, horrible storyline\\, Fin and Rose storyline was meaningless. The worst part is what they did to Luke's character\\, a true travesty. And I do mean who he was as a person. Phasma is a wasted character. Rey can do anything and beat anyone without any training in the force. Just horrible writing. Too many problems to list.","true":true}
