Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A structurally poor movie with many pacing problems further hindered by timeline problems which result from layering two separate stories which do not happen chronologically. Includes many scene recreations that feel lacking in originality.","true":true}
