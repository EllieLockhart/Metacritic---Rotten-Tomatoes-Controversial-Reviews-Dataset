Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie really disappointed me. It was underwhelming and I didn't feel like they did justice to Luke's character. It doesn't match with what the Force Awakens set up. There are also way too many plot holes and throw away characters who really shouldn't be throw away characters. I thought they also did a really bad job with Leia and her arc in this movie.","true":true}
