Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I am heart broken\\, brought the last of us 1 when it came out and had a blast with the father daughter bonding storyline and cool gameplay\\, this game not only brought nothing new to the gameplay system\\, it also undermined everything that made the first game interesting\\, realistic and heart warming.\rFor starters Tommy has no children IN THE APOCALYPSE! joel did not really move on and even died like a dog in a matter that did not even advanced the plot or made sense. Eli is an entitled idiot that **** on all the effort that brought her where she is AND TO BOOT SHE DOESN'T BREED\\, I MEAN YOU'RE HOLDING THE IMMUNITY GENE YOU **** AT LEAST BREED OR SOMETHING FOR MANKIND!!!! But the biggest grievance is making me see\\, play and interact with a bunch of terrible side characters that are all idiots\\, entitled and shallow\\, I would love the game to focus on the old guard and see how they can't keep up with families and health conditions that come with age\\, would be great\\, but we are stuck with this joke!
