Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lacked in story line from an adult perspective\\, but probably entertaining enough for kids.  Did well in getting a lot of diversity of actors involved also did well with adding a good amount of women in roles.   But the acting\/story telling was so-so.","true":true}
