The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Graphics\\, game-play\\, sound\\, everything about that is just 10\/10.\rThe story. The first half of the game is great. You have your mission as Ellie and you really feel what she feels. Then you get to the second part and if you are like me\\, you want to just throw the game out. But it was during that second half when I started to question myself\\, whether it is even worth to get our revenge with Ellie. And you realize\\, that this is what they were going for. To make you ask yourself\\, whether it is worth. The last mission was perfect for this. You really are in the position\\, where you are not sure\\, whether you are doing the right thing. The ending perfectly summarize all of yours and Ellie's feelings. It is not what we hoped for\\, but I think it is so much more. Every fan of the 1st game should give this a chance and to sit through it till the end. No matter the leaks\\, the flaws\\, or that you are not satisfied that Ellie did what she did in the end. I think it delivered bigger story than this generation of gamers can really appreciate by looking at the reviews. I know people have different opinions and that's fine. But we should try to look for the deeper meaning in the story\\, than just a dull revenge. We've seen this kind of story so many times. Naughty Dogs made something\\, that we were just not ready for and I love it. I don't regret a single minute spent with this game and I can't wait to play it again.\r\rFor those of you who saw the leaks or stopped playing the game after the golf scene and think this game is **** Everyone loved Joel from the 1st game. Watching him die was a punch in the face. But it was not unexpected. At the end of the 1st game we killed the Fireflies. A group that was trying to save the world. That was a very bad move for Joel\\, even if it meant saving Ellie. So you could have guessed he will have enemies that are trying to get a revenge for that. When you watch Joel die\\, you feel the same thing as Ellie. You just thing it's **** and you want to kill them for it. But try to sit through it. I knew about the leaks\\, but I honestly didn't care. I knew they had their reasons for it and that it will be worth it. It was. Just don't play it like \\\"This game is ****\\\". Give it a chance and you may find yourself being grateful for doing so. If you still think it's ****\\, I don't blame you and I respect it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
