Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'The Last Jedi' has several amazing and memorable moments\\, but the majority of it focuses too much on telling a story about the importance of inequality rather than equality through crude subterfuge and negative imagery: ignoring every major plot hole\\, including issues regarding the core of the story\\, to push a political agenda.\\n\\nHowever\\, for the sake of tl;dr: when you take away all things political and distracting\\, 'The Last Jedi' is a story about how the Rebels didn't have enough gas in their ship so they're set on a constant slow retreat while the Empire chases them slowly with barely any effort put in.\\n\\nEventually\\, the Rebels and every protagonist find a way to deal with their problems through several MacGuffins and then there are several clich\u00e9 plot twists that you can see a mile away and then there's the expected final show off between Luke and Kylo. Yeah\\, that's really it. \\n\\nMind you\\, all of this is going on while the movie is badly edited in scene sequence (from one scene to another\\, it's very jarring\/distracting; every time the scene changes\\, I was taken right out of enjoying the film).\\n\\nWithout spoiling\\, I did like the moments that focused on the humanity of the force users along with several striking imagery that are just downright impressive\\, but - other than those - majority of 'The Last Jedi' ranges from B-rated average to average cliche to below average\\, which is honestly saddening for me to say. Also\\, to put it frankly\\, if you're the kind of person who focuses on political commentary\\, you will probably hate this film: especially since most of the film's focus is on that rather than actually telling a good story with as few plot holes as possible.\\n\\nRecommendation: Watch it on television or via some other means that is free\\, and don't bother with a ticket nor a blu-ray; it's not worth the asking price for the disappointment that follows.","true":true}
