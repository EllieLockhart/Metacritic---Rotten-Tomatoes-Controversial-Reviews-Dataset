Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I beat this game in 20 hours. I streamed the whole thing. I feel as if I can give a justified review.\rWe waited for so long. I waited for a game that kept me up at night\\, dying from excitement to play it. The first game actually prompted me to go out and buy a PS4. This game was supposed to be above and beyond all expectations.\rOh how we were wrong.\rSTOP: Don't get me wrong\rIt was still graphically and mechanically an amazing game! Loved every bit of that.\rBUT\rI'm sure I speak for a lot of people when I say that the story was absolutely awful. Who in their right mind would've assumed that the fans liked the way this one played out? We saw no resolution to any conflict. Let's start at the first mistake.\rNaughty Dog did Joel SO dirty. Who is the bright mind that thought the route they took\\, was a good one? A character with several layers and stories\\, SNIPPED so early on? Not to mention the intuition and intellect Joel possessed was just mindlessly disregarded when he was shot and beaten like a dog. How on Earth are we supposed to just accept that? A man\\, a survivor\\, just shot and beaten like that? No. Big plot hole there. No way that was Joel. Absolutely disgraceful.\rThen Abby's story? NO ONE ASKED FOR THAT! If someone did\\, please point me in their direction as I'm at a loss.\rSo you're telling me\\, out of all of the incredible minds at Naughty Dog\\, THIS was the best story line you could come up with? This?? This misdirection and deceit you've pressed upon your fans is borderline criminal. I'm sure there are hundreds upon hundreds of fan fictions capable of surpassing this sorry excuse for a story\\, tenfold.\rThe ending to this game is just depressing. It's depressing to the point that it has ZERO replay value. I played the first one 3 times over as it was just THAT good and had such a hopeful message. It was an incredible story. How did you lose you way? Who came up with such a sad and tragic ending? Who would want to feel that way again? Ellie coming home and being 100% alone. She has no one. Unless there was something I missed\\, she's alone.\rI know I'm not the only one furious that after SO long\\, we were given a sorry excuse for a story. No one asked for Abby. Everyone screeched their lungs out at the sound of Joel's voice during the first reveal. Was that not enough of a sign? NO ONE ASKED FOR ABBY OR HER STORY! NO ONE!\r(not to say I didn't like it\\, but how dare you think that takes priority over the characters we all know and love)\r\rTLDR: Don't play it if you don't want your heart shattered into a million pieces and be left feeling SO disappointed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
