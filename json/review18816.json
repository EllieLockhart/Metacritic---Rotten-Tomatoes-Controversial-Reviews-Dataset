Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's amazing how many 4 and 5 star reviews I've read about this movie lead you to an error page when you click on their ID. The media has put out that there is a movement of fans using bots to bring this movie down but I would argue there is a movement of bots to bring it up. Especially after reading their actual posts. Why is Rotten Tomatoes allowing this... I have no idea.\\n\\nOn to the movie now. This is by far the worst Star Wars movie (if you even want to call it that) that I've ever seen. The story is ridiculous and full of holes. The character development is terrible with Rey the Mary Sue being an absolute joke of a character. Special effects are impressive but there is no substance here. Just superficial flair. The treatment of Luke Skywalker is really unforgivable. Mark Hamill should have declined to make the movie. I wish I could have the 2 and a half hours of my life back that I spent watching this.","true":true}
