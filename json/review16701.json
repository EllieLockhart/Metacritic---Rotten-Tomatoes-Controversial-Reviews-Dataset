Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would actually sincerely say this ever again\\, but the last Star Wars movie The Last Jedi is the best movie I saw this year. Not just the best sci-fi or the best action but the best motion picture! In addition\\, this is the best star wars movie since the original from 1977. Thank you Rian Johnson from the bottom of my childhood!","true":true}
