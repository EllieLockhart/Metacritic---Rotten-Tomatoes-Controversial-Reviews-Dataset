The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is not a game for fragile minds.\r\rUser reviews only speak of Joel's death\\, of the wet dreams they may have had with the character\\, it's always the same. But nobody asks: What is beyond this event? Why it happened? He deserved it? What happens next? What will these characters feel about that event?\rYes\\, it was horrible that he died\\, and he had a pathetic death\\, but it is the cause and effect of the acts of the \\\"crazy man\\\". It was a death that no one expects from the best character ever written. He deserved a better death\\, but in the reality of this game it is not.\r\rThis game more than entertain us\\, it destroys us. It leaves us with an existential void that consumes you and kills you.\rIt is a crude game\\, and cruel and it is in every right to be. It's The Last Of Us!\r\rIf you are looking to leave with a good taste in your mouth\\, go play fortnite or minecraft. They are fast\\, frantic games\\, and you don't need to think beyond their mechanics and kill without questioning the lives of others.\rThe Last Of Us more than a game\\, it is an experience. It is Ellie's evolution and the consequence of her actions. Not everything is Joel. That does not mean that he is an excellent character.\r\rThe world is so used to everything being rosy and that everything turns out as they want\\, that they are blinded by it and do not see what the human being (in this game or in real life) is capable of.\r\rThis game is great! And it does not deserve the injustice of these empty criticisms that for a fact destroy how great this game is.\rOkay\\, playing like Abby is maddening\\, maybe boring at times (No one wants to play like the villain) .. (Ah! But wasn't Joel exactly that in the previous game? ... A Villain?). Just think about it a little.\r\rLeaving Joel's event behind (which sets fanboys on fire)\\, the endgame leaves much to think about.\rWhat Ellie did can drive anyone crazy. Would you be able to do what she did without losing your sanity?\r\rMy mother taught me that forgiving is the most difficult honest act to perform in the world. But that is what nobody assumes: Assume when we are wrong.\rMore than revenge\\, this game is about forgiveness.\rAnd so Ellie deserves more and my respects.\r\rGreat game.\r\rIf you are sensitive-minded\\, don't buy the game. But it is an experience that has to be lived.\r\r100% recommendable.\r\rWriting this review I realized all the sensations that the game makes you feel in greater depth. Very nice job to NaughtyDog.\r\rEveryone has their tastes\\, but for God's sake\\, be fair with your criticism and say why you don't like it with respect.\r\rGood luck to you all!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
