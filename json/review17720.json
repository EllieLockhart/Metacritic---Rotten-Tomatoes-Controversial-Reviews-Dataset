Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It could have been great but the Last Jedi will forever remain one of the worst. Nothing is worse than a wasted opportunity. Now the next film will have to play damage control and increase the fan service to absurd levels. What we will get is a blunder followed by a course correction instead of an elegant and natural end to a 30+ year and nine film saga. ","true":true}
