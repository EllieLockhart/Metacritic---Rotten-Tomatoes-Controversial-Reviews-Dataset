Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly there are two things that I think fans are upset about. SPOILER ALERT ?? ....\\n\\n\\n1.) would be when Luke came back and he didn't throw a \\\"single punch\\\". I didn't see this as a problem the first time I saw it because when I saw him levitating on the rock and using the force to project himself across galaxies to fight Kylo. That shows his true Grandmaster power.\\n\\n2.) possibly the biggest is that Rey's parents are nobody. As an actor I can firmly say that I don't believe that is the truth. Of course that dark cave would play on her beliefs and show her that she had no parents. Of course Kylo would lie and say that her parents were nobodies. He was trying to make her turn. I do believe the truth about Rey's parents will be revealed in 9.","true":true}
