Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Joke with Poe and Hux at the beginning was drawn out way way too long.  Princess Leia surviving space and then flying through it without any major implications was ridiculous.  Casino Planet (Canto Bight) scene just seemed unnecessary and confusing.   Rose stopping Finn from ramming the cannon was just bad.  To me this unfortunately ranks as one of the worst Star Wars episodes.i","true":true}
