Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not often I dislike a movie as much as I did the last Jedi. There was very little continuity between awakens & tlj. There's a difference between picking on a scene and continuing a story. Rian Johnson spent more time giving original fans the finger with the way they handled the characters & the force as we knew it than time spent on the story for the movie. \\\"It's time to kill the past\\\" became a drinking game but one out of sorrow not happiness. Luke wasn't Luke & Leia with her Mary poppins act was distasteful to those that supported the franchise keeping it relevant. Killing off original characters of significance without any sentimentality at all. Admiral here one second gone the next no mention or recognition of the loss. Adding turning what could have been a great character of Rae into a millennial Mary Sue. Why train or bother with training scenes everyone else experienced. Let's skip to her strong in the force. Let's build up smoke than kill him off for shock value. This movie was for people with very little loyalty to characters or the actual history or story. It use to represent something. Add in acquiescing & pandering to gain new fans & adding in political & social agendas poorly and it just left me sad. Adding insult to injury suggestions of watching it again as if that would make it any better. People recommending it are the equivalent of someone saying \\\"this tast awful try it\\\"","true":true}
