Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Criminal waste of so sacred an artistic property. Almost as bad as the middle 3 movies\\, but with better actors to misuse\\, in this case. This writer\/director had no feeling for the material\\, settled for or even pursued childlike sensationalism\\, and WASTED so many moments\\, not to mention the acting talent at his disposal. I hate the Peter Principle. To whom was this daft\\, self-indulgent person accountable\\, artistically\\, and even technically? Where was the editor? A gorgeously shot waste of 150 minutes of life one will regret never getting back.","true":true}
