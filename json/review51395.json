Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute trash movie. Total waste of time. Plot was stretched\\, way to fast paced some places\\, and way to slow in others. Plot didn\u0092t make sense\\, too many jokes that they don\u0092t pull off correctly\\, some transitions were absolute trash. May I point out that Luke learned the way of the Jedi throughout 3 whole movies\\, being trained by Yoda. Now Rey comes in and seems to know everything to know about how to control rocks\\, maneuver a lightsaber\\, and all of the stuff that Luke learned throughout 3 movies\\, but she learned them in one. By the way\\, the actor for Kylo Ren is not great at all. And how the heck did Leia somehow get blown apart in their ship\\, and just stay alive in space? That\u0092s not how it works! She doesn\u0092t even know how to use the force! And did I mention that this movie is a waste of time? Don\u0092t see it\\, worst Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
