Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi does little to pander to fanboys\\, and takes a very bold step in a new direction. Dark\\, comedic\\, and action packed it has all the staples of a Star Wars film\\, but is not content to tread the same ground as previous films. For the first time in a very long time I truly feel like the Star Wars universe is prepared to go in a direction we have never seen before instead of the circles it has been treading for decades.","true":true}
