Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst piece of crap star wars film ... Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself. Mark Hamill\\, I'm so sorry\\, you deserved SO much better.\\n\\nThis movie was GOD AWFUL. \\n\\nAnd it's clear Rotten Tomatoes is nowhere near accurate when it comes to the Tomatometer. I predict Rotten Tomatoes will become obsolete in the next few years as people realize critics are paid\\, and RT's algorithms don't show the average critic rating anyway\\, just positive vs. negative. Metacritic is a far better option. Though it's still the same critics\\, and they're still paid off by Disney. lol","true":true}
