Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was disappointing if you are a Star Wars fan.  If there had never been another Star Wars movie it would be a good movie\\, but I didn't like the direction they took.  I feel like Disney just disrespected every fan who grew up loving these characters.  I think the fan backlash shows that the writers and director didn't truly think about the fans when developing this movie.  There is a hole in the plot and a hole in my heart.","true":true}
