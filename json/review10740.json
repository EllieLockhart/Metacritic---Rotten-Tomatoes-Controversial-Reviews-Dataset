Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half of the movie is exciting and feels like Star Wars. The side story is awful though\\, along with some weird Luke stuff\\, this is one of the worst Star Wars movies\\, but is an average movie overall","true":true}
