I personally think that RE2 remake has more plotholes.\r\rIf there is no the last of us Part 1\\, this game's score would have been higher than 8.0. People giving it 0 is because they didn't like the story as much as TLOU1\\, which is a bias. i am okay with the story based on revenge\\, a lot of game\/drama\/series did that\\, it's nothing wrong with that. You don't like the story doesn't make it a bad game\\, it just disappoint you based on the high expectation you have.\r\rPersonally i felt this game deserve a 8.5\\, but to balance those bias reviewer\\, i am giving it a 10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
