Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes no sense. It is a mess just like the force awakens but worse. It is time to retire the franchise.  so deeply silly.  Sorry\\, but I do not \\\"believe\\\" Rey. it makes no sense that she is a jedi and she is just all around silly like an anime cartoon.","true":true}
