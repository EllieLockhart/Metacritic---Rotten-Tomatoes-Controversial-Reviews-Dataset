Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worse film I have seen and there were a couple of nice touches\\, but it's so full of plot holes and character holes. It does not fit with any previous star wars films\\, some of the changes in character are a bit like watching Paddington 3 and finding out that Mr brown is a secret child beater.\\n\\nThe whole chase sequence is manufactured\\, do the first order have no other ships? Can they not jump one ship to lightspeed for half a second? Why are they slower? This is  space size and weight should not be an issue\\, they will not accelerate as fast but it should not restrict their top speed.\\n\\nCasino trip is pointless. \\n\\nI did like the throne room scene and I was fine with the luke ending if not the rest of his tale. \\n\\nHaving listened to the director interview its clear he was given too long a rope and just basically ignored everything before his own film. \\n\\nFinns character seems pointless now. Personally I think the saga has run its course. The first 3 and rouge one will be classics\\, the rest are just cash machines for Disney. Which is a shame. Other franchises have far better quality and at least have consistency throughout.","true":true}
