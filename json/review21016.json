Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't sure how I felt about The Last Jedi when I saw it th first time\\, however\\, after seeing it a second time I absolutely loved it. There is so much going on it was hard to process at first and the second time I saw it I was able to appreciate the the complexity and all of the emotions the film stoked. If you felt like I did when you saw it\\, go see it again. It's a totally different experience.","true":true}
