Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie in star wars history. This is the first time I've ever walked away from a star wars movie disappointed. \\n\\nLot's of try-hard feminism\\, unnecessary jokes\\, and most of all\\, questions left unanswered. The force awakens left us with questions about the next movie\\, the last jedi removed everything interesting. My personal theory is they are trying to \\\"out with the old in with the new\\\" which is fine. However theres a problem with this. when you are replacing characters for the sake of \\\"neo-feminism\\\" and race\\, you're going to fuck up somewhere. And that's just karma. BBC and Rian\\, the director\\, saying that star wars needs less white males. I don't think I saw any white males besides Hux but either way\\, who the fuck cares? I thought we were fighting racism as a society not joining it. \\n\\nAnyways\\, this movie was just bad. Not funny\\, not interesting\\, it literally takes directly after the force awakens. so we don't see any character development\\, the bad guys are useless and not intimidating\\, and the good guys look like the cast of Rent.\\n\\n#whathappenedtothestarwarsthatiusedtoknow\\n#liberalismisamentaldisorder\\n#liberalsarestealingstarwarsforpoliticalgain","true":true}
