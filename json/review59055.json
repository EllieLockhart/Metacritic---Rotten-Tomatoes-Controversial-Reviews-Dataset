This story is so bad that I\u2019ll never be able to play the first game with the same feelings again.I wished this game would have never been released.I\u2019m heartbroken how ND ruined Ellie and Joel for us TLoU fans who bonded with the characters in the first game and waited for 7 years for a sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
