Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Letting bombs fall on a ship in space\\, so there is gravity in space now between objects at such a strong level and instead of proton torpedos?!?! And an x-wing who takes out all the canons on a huge ship? One of the many details that were terribly wrong and badly displayed. These things are not to be discussed\\, it is just bad and lame. Bad things about the storyline itself are discussable.","true":true}
