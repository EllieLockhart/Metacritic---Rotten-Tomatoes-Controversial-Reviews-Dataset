Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Attempts at humour fall flat. Failure to effectively develop certain seemingly integral characters. Huge plot holes everywhere with characters seemingly acting completely incorrectly as prefaced in star wars 7. Overall a massive disappointment.","true":true}
