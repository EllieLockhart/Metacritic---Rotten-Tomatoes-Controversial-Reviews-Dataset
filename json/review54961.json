Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a decent movie. Lots of forced humor...in some parts I liked that bit and in others\\, not so much. Slow to start and has a few flaws. However\\, I think people are overreacting with their negative comments. People will always have this image of the 3 original Star Wars movies in their head and nothing will EVER compare. I get that. So with that being said\\, the new movies will never be comparable to the original but they are good movies in their own right. This wasn't a terrible movie. If I had to rate it on a 1-10 scale (10 being the best) I would give it a 6.5 or 7. My overall judgment would be to dial back the forced humor (we really don't need to laugh that much\\, this isn't a comedy...it is Star Wars) but the storyline was good. This movie falls short of Rogue One and The Force Awakens but it is worth the watch! I still love Star Wars and will always be a fan. ","true":true}
