Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disrespectful\\, abhorrent\\, mind-numbingly bad Star Wars. This movie goes out of its way to undo all the setup the force awakens laid out. Luke skywalker casually tossing his lightsaber over his shoulder and walking away from Rey instead of finalizing thelong-awaited epic meeting is a metaphor for how the film greatly mistreat its characters. Filled with cringey\\, modern humor\\, Mom jokes\\, and Luke Dusting off his shoulder during fight sequence. Welcome to the Disney\/mcu era of idiotic jokes. \\n\\nThis film Betrayed Luke Skywalker to the core. He was out of character\\, unwise\\, useless\\, and a joke. It's a crime how terribly he was handled and even Mark Hamill rightfully stated this. Leaves you with a gross\\, empty feeling. Worse than murder. And the numerous characters killed off long before they had a chance to develop....who is snoke? Who and where are the knights of Ren? Maz? Luke's green saber? Rey's family?? Shame on Kathleen Kennedy. Shame on Disney. \\n\\n3.","true":true}
