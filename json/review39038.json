Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THINGS I DISLIKE\\n\\nIn the opening scene\\, a Resistance pilot prank calls the First Order\\, an idiotic strategy that miraculously works. \\n\\nHux\\, the menacing fascist general from The Force Awakens\\, is suddenly a comic relief character. \\n\\nLeia flies through the vacuum of space like Mary Poppins and is in a coma until she wakes up when it is convenient for the plot.\\n\\nThe legendary hero Luke Skywalker is a hermit who milks grotesque alien sea cow udders.\\n\\nRey is the ultimate Mary Sue. She is devoid of flaws and feels more like a god than a human. \\n\\nPoe Dameron is unlikeable. He disobeys Leia and needlessly causes innumerable resistance fighters to die but is merely demoted. When he mutinies\\, Leia and Holdo speak fondly of him\\, instead of dishonorably discharging him. \\n\\nVice Admiral Holdo's purple hair and prom dress are distracting.\\n\\nIn a scene stolen out of Spaceballs\\, Finn and Rose are arrested for illegal parking at a casino where they are on a quest to find a master hacker. A different hacker breaks them out of jail. Finn and Rose free abused animals and ride them on a stampede into a casino. This casino subplot contributes nothing to the story.\\n\\nAt the climax\\, Rose crashes into Finn to prevent him from sacrificing himself to destroy the First Order super-cannon in a kamikaze attack. \\n\\nWhen Rose crashes into Finn to stop him from sacrificing himself to destroy the First Order super-cannon\\, she says the nonsensical line\\, \\\"This is how we win: Not by fighting what we hate but by saving what we love.\\\" Never mind that Finn was trying to sacrifice himself to save his loved ones. \\n\\nTHINGS I LIKE\\n\\nIn Star Wars\\, the audience meets Luke when he sees a projection of Leia asking for help and watches the twin suns set. In The Last Jedi\\, Luke sends an astral projection of himself to help Leia and fades into the Force as he watches the twin suns set.\\n\\nThe multiple conflicting flashbacks of Ben Solo's fall to the dark side were a nice homage to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon.\\n\\nThe cinematography and visual effects are fantastic.\\n\\nSome of the jokes are funny.","true":true}
