Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. I have never felt so ill leaving a movie theater. 12 hours later\\, I'm still at a loss for words other than to say TLJ is a disaster in every conceivable way. apart from the irreparable damage it has done to the SW story\\, it is just a very poorly written movie. Lots of flashy sci-fi effects may soothe some people\\, but if you enjoy SW for the STORY\\, this is not the film you are looking for.","true":true}
