Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hollywood can make any movie look good these days. But this was filled with left leaning political ideology (feminism\\, animal cruelty\\, stupid men) and so much bull crap that it ruined whatever it had going for it. The made up and unexplained force powers (Rey's ability to use the force with ZERO training) and the manufactured tension\\, long run time\\, and OBVIOUS rehashes from the empire strikes back and return of the Jedi (rebel base discovered\\, evacuate\\, space battle\\, hopeless defense on a white planet with trenches and AT-ATs...) makes it a true deviation from the Star Wars under GL. \\nGood luck Disney\\, sadly you'll make money no matter what.","true":true}
