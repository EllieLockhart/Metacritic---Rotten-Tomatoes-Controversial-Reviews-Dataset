Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"People who are saying that the game is bad\\, clearly did not want to understand what the game brings\\, nor did they try to see what happens in the history of the game. I think who complains about the game took these points into account:\r-There is no right or wrong side\\, everyone is wrong\r-The relationship between Ellie and Dina is not super sexualized as many lgbt + relationships are portrayed in different media\r-The humanization of Abby not putting her as a villain but as an ordinary human being who has normal feelings just like Ellie\r-The clear leveling of Abby\\, with Ellie\\, because they both wanted revenge\\, what differs is that Abby had her revenge but it didn't change anything in her life\\, she didn't bring her father back\\, since Ellie realized that taking revenge I wouldn't bring Joel back and that revenge is empty.\rHonestly those who complain about the story clearly did not want to understand or play the game properly. And do not mask your homophobia with meaningless comments saying that the story has holes and is poorly developed\\, people who have not even played the game want to have an opinion\\, will play the last the entire us 2 and then give a note.
