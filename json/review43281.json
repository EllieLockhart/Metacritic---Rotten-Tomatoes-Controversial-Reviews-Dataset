Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disgrace to the franchise as a whole. The humor rivaled that or George Lucas prequels. The pacing of the movie was dreadful for the first time ever I have felt myself nodding off and wishing I was somewhere else while in the cinema. Plot holes...don't even get me started. Once I saw Princess Leia flying through space I was instantly questioning the director and producers for letting this be the final product.  Rose\\, rivals jar jar for worst character in the franchise. Only positives were Luke and the beautiful landscapes. The crew and director for Rogue One should probably make the third movie to save this sinking ship.","true":true}
