Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is beautiful\\, expertly crafted\\, and surprising. I think the choices Rian makes are very bold and will be polarizing for fans\\, but on the whole I really like what he did","true":true}
