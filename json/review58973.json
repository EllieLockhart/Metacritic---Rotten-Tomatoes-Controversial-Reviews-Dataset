Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is next level. You really need to sit and play this game. I have never been so immersed in a game or with a set of characters before.  Obviously the graphics and game play are unmatched\\, that should go without saying. The acting in this game sets such high standards for future gaming (something we already knew with Naughty Dog games). The story is very dark\\, very draining and asks a lot of the player. It asks the player to trust the game and believe me it was hard. While playing the the second half\\, I too wanted to put my remote down and turn it off but I didn't. I wanted to get back to Ellie so badly I kept playing and playing\\, recklessly and rushing through some scenes. All of a sudden I started to realise that I cared about Abby. I didn't like her (the game never asks you to)\\, but I understand her. The new characters are mostly great additions and really fleshed out. Definitely read the journals while you play. Once I had finished\\, man I was wrecked. Emotionally and mentally I needed to step away from the game and think about everything that had happened and everything I had done. It was there that I realized that this was an incredible game. I applaud Naughty Dog for the direction they took. I was a huge risk but for me it really paid off. It sucks if people genuinely didn't enjoy the game. Perhaps at a different stage in their life they might\\, i don't know. Either way\\, for me\\, this is the best game I have ever played. No medium has ever stuck in my head for so long. I am still thinking about the story and my interpretations. Uncharted was my favourite game series but TLOU has officially taken it's place.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
