Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow.. how to totally screw up the new Star Wars Trilogy in one movie.  Not only does the writer\/director seem confused by his own narrative\\, but actively contradicts his message at the same time.  Luke Skywalker is a complete and utter disappointment.  And all the characters and relationships we love are hardly touched on\\, and they hardly interact through the entire movie.  I would've loved to see more Chewbacca\\, Luke Skywalker\\, R2-D2 and old characters developing relationships and interacting with new characters.  But we get none of that\\, instead our time is wasted\\, and the movie is dragged on by the silliest plot lines\\, and not only that\\, but the reveals are terrible.  Not one thing happened\\, that revealed something interesting.  A complete disappointment.","true":true}
