Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst Star Wars ever\\, but only because the \\\"cute chicken-like character\\\" lacked the power of speech unlike Jar Jar Binks. Hard to suspend disbelief with a lot of the plot. Like\\, really? You jet off to a casino in the middle of the rebel fleet being attacked? And whose idea was it to cast Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro in this movie? I assume they have the \\\"right\\\" Hollywood views and so they are cast in order to keep making money to give to their various causes? While this movie had its moments\\, it was\\, overall\\, a failure.","true":true}
