Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the Force Awakens\\, saw it twice in cinema\\, bought it on itunes\\, watched it 5-6 times to date. when rogue one came out it blew me away\\, imho it is second only to empire\\, have watched it 10 times to date. i liked rian johnson's earlier movies\\, loved brick (detective noir is my fave genre)\\, looper not as much\\, but has merit. i didn't see last jedi in the cinema\\, my enthusiasm waned due to what i was seeing online from both detractors & advocates. it has taken me almost 6 months to watch the last jedi and my only regret is that i wasted $4 to hire the blu-ray. this movie is not a star wars movie. it neither honours what came before it\\, nor leaves a legacy for what comes after. it is a creative black hole as far as the script and direction\\, which is a shame because everyone else involved in the production outdid themselves. Viz and sound fx are outstanding\\, costuming and set design too. The actors all did the best with what little they were given\\, even poor mark hamill\\, what an insult not only to his character luke\\, but to the man himself\\, how degrading. as for all the talk of diversity\\, star wars has always been diverse\\, on both sides of the screen. as an asian man myself\\, i appreciated donnie yen in rogue one\\, i'm a long time fan of his\\, but i've never needed someone to look like me to be inspired by them. my childhood pop-culture heroes were bruce lee\\, luke skywalker\\, optimus prime & storm from the x-men\\, 4 disparate characters that all embodied heroism\\, integrity & self-sacrifice\\, desirable traits to emulate. but as bad as this film is (to me) it is the bigotry and lack of self awareness from disney & lucasfilm that has turned me off star wars for good. Didn't watch Solo\\, don't care if it was good\\, won't buy the toys for my children or any other lucasfilm product. i'm not boycotting\\, just not interested anymore. won't support anyone that refers to me as a nazi - or stands silent as their advocates do so - yet is happy to utilise nazi-inspired imagery to sell their products to children.","true":true}
