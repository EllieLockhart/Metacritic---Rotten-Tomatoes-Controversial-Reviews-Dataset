Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"0 build on any character in the movie. You made Luke\\, the GOAT of all jedis look weak as fuck. You hyped up this snoke character for 2 years and still have no back story and he also died extremely easy. Rose did not need to be in the movie nor the casino shit. Could have found a better way to use Finn. Force communication between Rey and Kylo was extremely exaggerated. Disney should just give Star Wars back to George Lucas so he can make this right.  The guys that make theories on YouTube could have made a better movie then this. Very disappointing\\, ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
