Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see this movie with an open mind. I expected Disney type cutie aliens\\, a diverse cast of all races (human and alien) and family friendly \\\"You're awesome\\\"\\, \\\"No\\, you're Awesome\\\" dialogue. All I wanted was to be entertained for 2.5 hours. \\n\\nInstead\\, we have another ripoff of an original Star Wars script\\, made worse by terrible writing\\, lame jokes and so many plot holes you could hide the entire rebel fleet in the smallest one. \\n\\nFrom the lamest slow speed space race in Sci-Fi history\\, through the obvious  - Vice Admiral Holdo party dressed\\, so out of place she must be a traitor - through the ridiculous - let's follow the doggies out of the cave with no exits\\, to the absolutely stupid\\, let's now escape... at light speed ???? \\n\\nAnd let's not forget the \\\"away team\\\" who gets... arrested for illegal parking. \\n\\nDisney has done it's utmost to write the most nonsensical dribble since... well\\, ever. I am not sure who got beaten worse in this episode: the rebel fleet\\, or the viewers.\\n\\nThis is too bad because the cast is entirely likable\\, the cgi is excellent and the parts involving Rey and Kylo are OK. In fact Kylo almost redeems himself from being the loser with granddaddy issues from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\".","true":true}
