Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I truly do not understand this audience rating. I was 5 years old when Star Wars hit theaters but didn't see it until the re-release in 1978\\, just to establish my baseline. I won't claim that The Last Jedi is perfect\\, but I will claim that it is fantastic. Beautifully shot\\, well-acted\\, dialogue that (mostly) doesn't make anyone wince\\, and great characterization throughout. I sincerely feel like I've seen a different film than most of the reviewers here\\, but then\\, I'm sure they'll feel the same way.","true":true}
