Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way to many loop holes from last movie left open along with storyline choices that didn't seem nessasary or make any logical sense.   Not to mention of few characters that just didn't work or might as well  not have even been in the movie.    There was a handful of good parts building to the next movie though.   But how they build off that will be another story lol","true":true}
