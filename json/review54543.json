Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a life long Star Wars fan. Have seen them all read lots of the books\\, bought tons of the toys for my son. I loved the first six movies under George Lucas even the prequels. The force awakens was the first sw I only watched one time. Rogue one also just one time. Just don't have the magic of the other movies. This last Jedi movie takes the cake though. The worst by far. I'm not a fanboy. I'm as true blue as it gets. Disney has failed us. They canceled clone wars and give us rebels? Then fallow the prequils that had depth of story and awesome original action with this crap. The last Jedi is just not a good movie. I truly miss George. He was good at making Star Wars movies. I don't care what the internet says. This movie stinks.","true":true}
