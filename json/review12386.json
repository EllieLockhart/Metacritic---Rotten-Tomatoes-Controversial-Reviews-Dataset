Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe if you're a fan of the Skywalker legacy\\, specifically Luke.....then you're going to have a really hard time with this movie. If you're excited to see the franchise move away from Skywalker then you will be happy.....Skywalkers are failures","true":true}
