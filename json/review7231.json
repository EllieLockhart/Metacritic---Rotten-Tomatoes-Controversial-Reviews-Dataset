Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, daring and fun. I genuinely enjoyed this movie and thought that it was perfect. While they took some characters in directions that were unexpected or may have felt underwhelming you need to realize that there are more than the films and a characters origins may be explained in comics\\, novels or shows like the clone wars and rebels series. I am a huge fan of Adam Drivers Kylo Ren and his raw aggression.","true":true}
