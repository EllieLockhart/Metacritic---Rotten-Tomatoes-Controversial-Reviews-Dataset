Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a major disappointment.  There was too much SJW stuff happening in the movie.  I really wanted to like this movie but I found myself bored within the first 20 minutes.  It's the first time I have ever checked my watch during a movie hoping it would end soon.","true":true}
