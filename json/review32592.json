Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars\\, the Last Jedi is a failure: misplaced and unfunny humor that will make the entire room cringe\\, characters so shallow and uninteresting that will make you miss JarJar Binks\\, questionable choices and actions from every\\, and I mean every character that will make you shout at the screen for just how much idiotic everyone seems to be.\\nAdd to that an almost non-existant story and you have a movie that will anger the fans and bore the rest.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and don't waste your money to go watch it. Wait until the hype dies off and everyone eventually realizes how much of a disappointment this movie really is.","true":true}
