Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the scenes were pointless. Why spend millions just to preach that the brass hero in all other flicks are not going to be in this one. Disney wants to preach instead of make money. I think this will not be the money maker it should be. Again\\, so many pointless parts and is demonstrated by rey handling over the light saber to luke. The thing that luke does is basicly what the whole movie is about.","true":true}
