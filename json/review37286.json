Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot\\, character development and overt ideological sub-plots were so absurd\\, so forced and so inept\\, I wanted to rip my eyes out and plug my ears with them. The writers claimed they write a story and added characters. No wonder it failed. SW was always written around characters. The critics scores are in the 90's? Wow... Nothing says paid hacks like the discrepancy between the fans and the idiotic critics who are probably just paid by the industry to hold unfounded\\, illogical \\\"opinions\\\". Also... Shame on the treatment of Mark Hamill's legacy\\, Shame.","true":true}
