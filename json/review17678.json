Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It appears Rian Johnson took everything JJ was building up in the force awakens and threw it away... Far to much humour\\, like seriously they killed every tense scene with unnecessary humour? \\n\\nThey wasted so much potential with so many characters.. Luke wasn't Luke\\, Phasma is a worse mirror image of Boba Fett\\, Snoke was a massive disappointment and Leia's character was weird as well\\, especially the flying scene.\\n\\nI think it would be far to say that 70-80% of this movie is filler just so that character has something to do in this movie. \\n\\nIm only giving one star due to some nice visuals\\, but due to lack of world building\\, terrible story\/character choices it doesn't sit well in my books.","true":true}
