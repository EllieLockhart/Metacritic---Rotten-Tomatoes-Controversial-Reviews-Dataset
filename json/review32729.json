Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS The Last Jedi personally not as great as The Empire Strikes Back but a very good movie nonetheless. The movie feels right and really expands on The Force Awakens. Best part no rip of of older movies","true":true}
