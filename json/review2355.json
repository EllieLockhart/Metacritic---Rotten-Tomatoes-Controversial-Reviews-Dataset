Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At the core of this film is a shockingly poorly written script. The Last Jedi abandons what we loved about the old characters and derails any sense of wonder or enthusiasm we had for the new characters. Audiences are left with a puzzling emptiness searching for a reason to be excited for the final chapter in this trilogy.","true":true}
