Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find there are a lot of things that work with the movie and even would make the movie great. But how they perverted the very nature of Luke makes everything wrong! Hwo can the always optimistic and the lightbringer Luke. Luke even knowing that his father was a Lord Sith all the way\\, said: I know i can bring him back. But with his nephew he sensed the dark side and his instinc was to kill him? It's gabage!","true":true}
