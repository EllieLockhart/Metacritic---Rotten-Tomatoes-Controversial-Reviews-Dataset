As a 7 year over-hype sequel finally out Tlos2 sadly throw everything that it predecessor achieve out of the window. It hurt me to write this review but i can confident to say that i did not enjoy this game at all.\r\rThe graphic are good\\, the atmosphere of the ruin world where human are not the top of the food-chain anymore are still there. Im happy to see technology improvement help artist paint the more realistic world than ever before. The maps are bigger that the last game and it feel like you have more option to explore. But there isnt any major myth for you to find out like Tomb Raider and the progression fell pretty linear. There are a bunch of accessible options in which some make the game completely turn into a walking simulator. I suggest you should check those first when started playing. AI are just like before\\, not really bright. They wont make you fell threatened. Cut scene are way too many sometime i feel like im watching a movie. I can say over all its a so-so\\, its what i expected when buying the game nothing out of the ordinary.\r\rThe story is not what i expected. The theme and direction are completely opposite first game. Turning a new leaf but not in a good way. The first game show us there are beauty in everything\\, acceptance of losing your loved one and natural way of healing past drama. While this game is about vengeance and hatred. The game force us to feel and understand the felling of the new character while we doesn't have any deep emotional connection except rage and confused toward them. Like you are forced to spend a day with your high-school bully while having constantly being a dick to your best friend. That doesn't feel nature enough to make me feel bad for him because his mother mistreat him as a kid. And then on the final decision you couldn't make it yourself and force to watch another cut-scene again. I think cheap 1$ visual novel have more option to choose than this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
