Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie could of been better. There were some amazing visuals\\, and some of the scenes were perfectly done. Editing was a bit of an issue in my opinion and if it been done better\\, I think it would of been a better overall movie. It just seemed like the movie was constantly at a pace that wasn't Star Wars and had they of taken more time to 'perfect' the story then I think the movie wouldn't of been so divisive.","true":true}
