Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many tricks missed with Episode 8. I thought the tone of humour completely misjudged\\, and a middle act that went nowhere. Mark Hamill was standout for me\\, but why so many deaths of mainstream characters?? It feels like it's being taken away from the generation that put it where it is today.","true":true}
