Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Algo triste\\, especialmente por el personaje de Luke... degradado a un punto lamentable\\, el personaje sobre el que se construyo tan magnifica saga vuelto un completo perdedor... Su redenci\u00f3n al final bastante pobre y deja un sabor mas agrio que dulce. Episodio 7 me dejo queriendo viajar al futuro para poder ver la continuaci\u00f3n YA! Despu\u00e9s de ver episodio 8 no siento ning\u00fan inter\u00e9s en ver lo que sigue.","true":false}
