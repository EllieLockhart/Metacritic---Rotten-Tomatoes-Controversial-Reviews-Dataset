Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing\\, lacks an engaging story\\, provides little in answers or mythos. Feels like a lifeless ripoff of a Star Wars movie with a few pleasing moments being the only saving grace. George Lucas\u2019 Star Wars >>>>>>> Disney\u2019s Star Wars.","true":true}
