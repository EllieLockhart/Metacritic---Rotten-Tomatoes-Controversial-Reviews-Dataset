Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\tLuke isn't Luke (Mark Hamill said very openly \\\"this is not my Luke\\\" and then was forced to apologize for telling the truth)\\n\tLuke's character is completely destroyed - he takes the lightsaber and throws it over his shoulder\\, he's now a coward\\, a loser\\, depressed\\, grumpy\\, thought about killing a child while he slept\\, made no attempt to save Han\\, doesn't care what happened to anyone\\, roams around the island like a homeless alcoholic\\, never leaves the island\\, has to be given a lecture by Rey and talked down to\\, and then dies with no explanation as to why he died\\, I guess he used up all his force and died\\, an assassination of a 40 year legendary character \\n\tYoda shows up for no reason\\, acts like a laughing fool\\, destroys the Jedi archives which Luke was going to do anyway\\, pointless cameo\\n\tJedi ghosts can suddenly interact with the physical world \\n\tNo one cares Han Solo died\\, he gets a few very brief acknowledgements and that's it \\n\tRey is still a Mary Sue\\, she can do everything\\, beat everybody\\, requires no training\\, puts Luke (a Jedi Master) on his ass in 15 seconds and could have killed him right there if she wanted to\\, why did she even go to the island\\, she can handle herself without Luke's help\\n\t\\\"LAZER SWORD\\\"\\n\tRey's parents were nobodies\\, choke on your two years of theories\\n\tChewbacca is hanging out with Rey for no reason\\n\tThe \\\"slow chase\\\" main plot makes no sense\\, just keep chasing them and shoot them!
