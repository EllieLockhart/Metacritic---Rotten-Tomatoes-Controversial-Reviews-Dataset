Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely not the worst Star Wars movie! It was very different from the previous movies but I feel like it went in a good direction- really\\, it went in the only direction this series could possibly go after everything that's happened. The ONLY downside\\, and the reason I had to knock off a star\\, is that the plot of Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rose didn't seem very important. It brought us a good message at the end but other than that I would've rather seen more of the Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren plot- or just had a 2-hour movie instead of 2 and a half hours. Can't wait to see where this goes in episode IX!","true":true}
