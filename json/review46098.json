Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. Shallow and without any story or character development. Plot holes abound. They have traded the adventure and the essence of the original series for a cheap politically correct story that targets millennials. Main themes are that religion is bad\\, heros do not exist\\, and you can have great power without training and hard work.  \\n\\nThis movie did not give Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher the respect that they deserved. Mark Hamill plays a whiny\\, middle aged\\, broken man who should be in therapy. His entire character arc was wasted in this miserable film.","true":true}
