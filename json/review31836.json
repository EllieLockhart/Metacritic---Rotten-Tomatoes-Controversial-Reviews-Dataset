Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spectacular! There was lots of speculation about Rae turning to the dark side\\, but the way it unfolded was unexpected and riveting. There was a smattering of laugh out loud humor and some awesome character development. It wasn't as enjoyable as Force Awakens\\, but it rocked!","true":true}
