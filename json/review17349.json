Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw a lot ov Youtube reviews before I went to see the movie for myself and I honestly expected to hate it... however I was in for a real positive surprise. This is one of the best Star Wars Movies ever...","true":true}
