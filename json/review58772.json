Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Some of the combats were fun but overall the story was terrible. It would have made sense for many people to want to hunt down Joel and Ellie but this was just a revenge story for multiple characters. It makes no sense that the entire world stop looking for Ellie\\, Joel\\, or a cure. The game was intent on destroying everything fans loved about the first game. Joel\\, Ellie and Tommy are all destroyed\\, as are their relationships with each other and with everyone else. New factions are introduced and there could have been something very interesting there but the focus is purely on personal rage\\, revenge and hate. The story could have been redeemed a bit if Abby had offered to take Ellie to the Fireflies at the very end to complete what TLOU1 mission was and what Ellie had wanted along and what Abby\u2019s dad wanted. The intro of yet another faction in the last 5% of the game was also never really explained. There werent even any lazy storytelling by way of found notes to give context to these rattlers\\, prisoners and chained zombies. Too many loose ends\\, too little character development\\, too little chemistry in the romances and no depth in these new loyalties\/friendships that are introduced.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
