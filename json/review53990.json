Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so disappointed with the missed opportunities this film created I'm sure we were all looking forward to a face off between Luke and snoke\\, or a big revelation to where Rey came from (and no I wasn't necessarily hoping for her to he Luke's or obi wan's decendant) but something would have been better than nothing. Personally I felt Laura dern phoned in her performance and after speaking with a lot of people I don't seem to be alone in that. The over use of guardians of the Galaxy type humour was unnecessary as star wars has never needed that slapstick humour before (hello jar jar) and although some of it was funny most of it just reminded me that it was Disney pulling the strings which TFA managed to avoid doing. Although it had some good plot points\\, great visuals and interesting development with kylo and Rey I can't help feeling disappointed with the overall film I've never left the cinema on such a downer after a star wars movie even the prequels left me in a much better mood than this. Personal opinion worst film of the series bar none I just hope 9 can rectify the mistakes made in this one to make an all round acceptable trilogy because that way I can overlook a weak middle section.","true":true}
