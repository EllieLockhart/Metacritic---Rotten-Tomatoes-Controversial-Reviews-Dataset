{"101487":118247,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\,\\, but ultimately kinda disappointing. After so many dieing at the end of \\\"Rogue One\\\" and Han getting killed at the end of \\\"The Force awakens\\\" I had hoped that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" would have a more positive upbeat story line. But sadly Star Wars is becoming like everything Else\\, Drama and tragedy. It's like the writers don't even know what happiness is anymore \\, so how can they even write a story about it?  :\/","true":true}
