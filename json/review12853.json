Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn\u2019t like how the old characters were developed and the new characters\\, particularly the leads\\, were not developed like they should be to this point in the series. The plot and motivations of characters didn\u2019t make sense to me. My least favorite of all the Star Wars franchise\\, and that\u2019s saying something that I thought higher of The Phantom Menace.
