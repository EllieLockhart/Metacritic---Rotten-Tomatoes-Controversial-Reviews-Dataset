{"101487":114605,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear God\\, what a dumpster fire of a movie. And I'm not being all \\\"well\\, that's not the story that I would have written.\\\" It's a genuinely disappointing and bizarre movie. It lacks the sense of gravitas and grandeur of Episodes 4\\, 5\\, 6 (minus the scenes on Endor)\\, and 3. Yes\\, Episode 3 was a good story\\, poorly acted by Hayden Christiensen and most of the other actors. \\n\\nTLJ was like a fan-film made by the faculty at UC Berkeley. The story sucked. The fights sucked. Lens flare in the first 5 seconds after the opening crawl ends. The lightsaber battle between Snoke's guards and Ben\/Rey looked like something choreographed out of Batman Begins. Every SJW cliche that could be packed into a 2-hour movie was there.  The only white guys are Darth Emo\\, Ginger General Patton\\, the rest of the Space Nazis\\, and Jedi Master Get-Off-My-Lawn Skywalker. There is still NO explanation of why Ben Solo fell to the Dark Side\\, how Ben Solo and Snoke met\\, why Ben Solo is constantly about to break into tears like a snowflake whose Mommy just took away the Xbox because he's 30 and still hasn't gotten his driver's license yet\\, no explanation of who Snoke is\\, no convincing explanation of who Rey's parents were (especially after she seemed to be Han Solo's daughter in TFA). You cannot have an audience get emotionally hooked on a character when these questions are still unresolved. And the Kylo\/Rey mind meld\\, which strongly suggested they were siblings\\, turns out to be Snoke saying \\\"Psyche! That was me making you two Skype each other.\\\" \\n\\nThe casino planet involved war profiteering\\, rich people\\, animal rights abuse\\, child slave labor\\, and it's all made better when Space Short-Round pulls a saddle off Space Mastiff-Horse and says \\\"It's all better now.\\\" I could think of a thousand ways to make a better story of how to get Rose and Finn onto Snokes Super-Duper-Mega-Star-Destroyer. And their plan didn't do ANYTHING to advance the story; their plan actually failed. \\n\\nPurple Admiral knew she couldn't run away\\, couldn't jump to lightspeed\\, so instead of cloaking the transports and sending them away NOW and doing hyperspace ramming to cover their escape\\, she waits til the medical vessel is blowed up\\, the other vessels are space dust\\, and most of the transports are gone. That is your plan??? I wouldn't let her run an HR department's annual Winter Solstice Non-Denominational Holiday Social Gathering\\, much less the Resistance's remnants of a space fleet. \\n\\nEven the end\\, the question of \\\"how will we build the Resistance\\\" is answered with \\\"we have everything here we need: strong chicks full of GRRRL POWER\\, People of Color\\, aliens\\, and no white guys.\\\"\\n\\nI have to say\\, Luke is a whiny loser at first BUT redeems himself at the end. It was a grand way for him to die\\, and it messes with Kylo Ren's head bigtime. But why did he die? No answer.\\n\\nThe cinematography sucked. The budget must have accidentally deleted the CGI line item for Yoda\\, so somebody broke into George Lucas' house and stole the puppet yoda from 1980's ESB. Yoda and Luke supposedly burnt up the Jedi books\\, yet somehow they are on the Falcon. The whole story is just one big mess\\, a giant mess of a story. Episode 8: Space Dumpster-Fire.  I started thinking at some part in the middle\\, \\\"It actually makes Episodes 1 and 2 look good.  \\\" This movie is THAT BAD. \\n\\nI hope ticket sales plummet like a rock and nobody goes to see Episode 9; I know I won't.","true":true}
