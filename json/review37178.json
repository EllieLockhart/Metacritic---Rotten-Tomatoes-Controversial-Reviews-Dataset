Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only things in this Galaxy that are more incompetent than the Rebels\\, are the New Order. The movie feels like it should be playing the Benny Hill theme most of the time.","true":true}
