Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like Rian Johnson has never seen the entire star wars saga. What we got was disrespectful to to the series as a whole and the fans that have supported it. Star wars is supposed to be written in a way that it has a certain rhythm to it and it connects itself to the other films. This movie couldn't even follow the one that came directly before\\, let alone have any sort of semblance to the rest of the series as a whole.","true":true}
