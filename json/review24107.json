Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

Snoke acaba siendo un pretexto tonto para que Kylo sea un villano tonto. como un aprendiz puede hacerle eso a Jedi legendario como luke? por que kylo al tener un problema con su maestro lo hace matar a todos los que tiene enfrente. las motivaciones de kyle no son lo suficientemente fuertes. la comunicaci\u00f3n de Kylo y Ray termina siendo una mentira. entre tantas cosas absurdas","true":false}
