Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a very good continuation of an epic saga. It has its flaws\\, but overall\\, I was happy with the experience. Those that were tired of the same trope used in Episode 4\\, 6\\, and 7 will be pleased that this chapter goes no where near it. The abilities characters can use through the force are expanded and characters are fleshed out. While some of the special effects were below what I would expect\\, (I'm looking at you\\, porgs!) most were dazzling and just what you'd expect from Star Wars. I very much enjoyed the relationships between the main characters. Luke seems to have taken on some of Yoda's eccentric traits\\, which could be explained from his hermit-like isolation. The movie had a few moments that dragged\\, but had others that needed more time. I can't wait to see it again. there really was so much to take in. I may upgrade my rating after I give it a few more viewings.","true":true}
