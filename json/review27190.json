Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst star wars movies ever made. I feel cheated out of my time and money\\, not only does the movie fail at being a star wars movie but it cannot even stand on its own merits. Full of regressive left propaganda\\, plot holes and poorly written script. Very few redeeming features. Disney is trying to kill the franchise and wont ever let go of the IP. Guess its EU for me","true":true}
