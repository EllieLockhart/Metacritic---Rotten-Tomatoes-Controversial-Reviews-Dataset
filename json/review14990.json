Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just watched a horrible and dumb Star Wars movie\\, probably the worse of them. All my expectations were high for this new episode\\, and I believe it was the same for many people. Force Awakens left so many good plots and mistery to the sequence that this movie had all the potential to be great. But all that was wasted by the hands of Ryan Johnson. Seriously\\, you just turned Lea into a fucking Superman (Mary Poppins)\\, transformed Rey into a jedi master with little to no training from Luke\\, which you killed in a meaningless scene at the end of the movie. My last hope was the unknowned evil leader character\\, Snooke\\, which could be the perfect\\, enemy for Luke\\, and yes\\, you killed him without any explanation about his story and who he is\\, why even bother to create him. \\n\\nThere was a lot more that made this movie a joke\\, but I'll just finish with this last sentence. Ryan Johnson killed Star Wars\\, I will not watch any other Disney Star Wars movie ever again.","true":true}
