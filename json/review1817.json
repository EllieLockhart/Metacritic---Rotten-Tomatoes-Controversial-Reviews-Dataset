{"101487":105499,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AS BAD AS THE PREQUELS WERE\\, ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHOSE NAME I WON'T MENTION (THE ONE WITH THE UNIVERSALLY HATED CGI CHARACTER WHOSE NAME I ALSO WON'T MENTION)\\, THEY AT LEAST HAD STORIES THAT WERE REMOTELY PLAUSIBLE\\, AND THE ACTING\\, WOODEN AS IT WAS AT TIMES\\, WAS TOLERABLE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT CGI CHARACTER\\, OF COURSE). AND GEORGE LUCAS MADE COURSE CORRECTIONS ALONG THE WAY\\, TO ADDRESS CONCERNS VOICED BY FANS WORLDWIDE (HENCE THE NEAR-DISAPPEARANCE OF SAID CGI CREATURE).\\n\\nDISNEY\\, ON THE OTHER HAND\\, HEEDED NO SUCH ADVICE WHEN IT FORGED AHEAD WITH THIS STINK PILE OF A FILM. THE DIALOG IS TERRIBLE\\, THE STORY COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS\\, WITH MORE HOLES IN THE PLOT THAN A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE RIDDLED WITH BULLETS. BUDDING ROMANCES AND DEATHS ARE THROWN IN MERELY AS DIVERSIONS\\, AND YOU'RE ALLOWED NO TIME TO GRIEVE FOR THOSE WHO DIE\\, OR TO IMAGINE THAT THE ROMANCES BLOSSOMING BEFORE YOU ARE MORE THAN TWO ACTORS PRETENDING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA\\, BEFORE THE WHOOSH! AND BOOM! AND FLASH! OF THE NEXT MINDLESS ACTION SCENE COMPLETELY RETURNS YOUR MIND TO THE NUMB STATE IT WAS IN MOMENTS PRIOR. I'M NOT EVEN A DIRECTOR\\, BUT I NOTICED THAT THE IMPORTANT SCENES WEREN'T EVEN FRAMED RIGHT OR PACED TO ALLOW THE VIEWER TIME TO PROCESS. IT'S LIKE\\, \\\"OH\\, IT'S TIME TO KILL THIS PERSON...BOOM...DONE...MOVE ON\\\" OR \\\"HEY\\, LET'S CRASH SOMETHING AND LET TWO PEOPLE CRAWL OUT OF THE WRECKAGE\\, FIND EACH OTHER\\, AND KISS. OKAY\\, CHECK THAT OFF\\, NOW LET'S BACK TO BLOWING STUFF UP!\\\"\\n\\nTWO YEARS AGO\\, WHEN I WATCHED THE FORCE AWAKENS\\, I WANTED IT TO BE GOOD\\, AND I TOLD MYSELF FOR DAYS AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS. BUT REALITY SET IN\\, ESPECIALLY LATER WHEN I PURCHASED THE MOVIE AND WATCHED IT ON MY SCHEDULE. BUT I COULD TELL THAT JJ ABRAMS WAS AT LEAST TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THE THINGS FANS WERE MISSING FROM THE PREQUELS. RIAN JOHNSON DID NOT DEMONSTRATE ANY SUCH CONCERN HERE. IT WAS TWO AND A HALF HOURS OF BLOWING STUFF UP\\, THINGS HAPPENING THAT ARE PHYSICALLY OR BIOLOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE\\, PEOPLE WHOOSHING AROUND FOR THE SAKE OF WHOOSHING\\, AND PEOPLE DYING BECAUSE GENERAL LEIA WANTED TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE APPROACHING ENEMY.\\n\\nIT'S STUPID BEYOND COMPARE\\, AND THERE ARE LINES OF DIALOG AND WHOLE SCENES IN THIS THAT WILL COMPLETELY TAKE YOU OUT OF THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE AND REMIND YOU THAT YOU'RE WATCHING A DISNEY PRODUCTION\\, AN EXPENSIVE\\, SHINY TOY THAT ULTIMATELY HAS LITTLE SUBSTANCE. I HONESTLY WAS EXPECTING POE OR FINN TO TURN AND LOOK AT THE CAMERA AT SOME POINT\\, THAT'S HOW BAD AND DESPERATE THE HUMOR FELT.\\n\\nI'VE AVOIDED SHARING SPECIFICS HERE\\, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO STILL WANT TO SPEND $15+ TO WASTE TWO AND HALF HOURS OF YOUR LIFE. I WILL SHARE A FEW INTENTIONALLY OBSCURE OBSERVATIONS\\, SO THAT WHEN YOU DO SEE IT YOU'LL FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN:\\n\\n* ARE THERE REALLY PHONES WITH HOLD BUTTONS IN A GALAXY FAR\\, FAR AWAY?\\n* LUKE MADE DRINKING A GLASS OF MILK DISTURBING\\n* THE PORGS WERE ENTERTAINING...WHERE DID THEY GO???\\n* WHY WOULD YOU ENTRUST A SPACESHIP'S PRIMARY FUNCTION TO A WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL?\\n* WHAT HAPPENED TO SHIELDS ON SPACESHIPS\\, ESPECIALLY LARGE\\, IMPORTANT ONES THAT OTHERS MIGHT WANT TO DESTROY?\\n* IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS SHOOTING AT YOU\\, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE FLEEING IN A STRAIGHT LINE?\\n* DO YOU REALLY NEED TO LEAVE YOUR SHIELD DOORS OPEN RIGHT UP TO THE POINT YOU CAN SEE THE ENEMY WITH YOUR NAKED EYES? WOULDN'T A CAMERA OR RADAR BE BETTER?\\n* ONLY A BLIND PERSON COULD HAVE MISSED THE GIGANTIC TUNNEL IN THE BACK; YOU DIDN'T NEED AN ANIMAL TO SHOW YOU THE WAY.\\n* THE RED ROOM REMINDED ME OF A SET FROM THE DONNIE AND MARIE SHOW...FROM THE 1970S.\\n* HOW DO THINGS INTERACT WITH A HOLOGRAM SOMETIMES\\, BUT PASS THROUGH THEM AT OTHERS?\\n* IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY BEHIND WITH THE SHIP\\, WHY WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE FLEEING THE SHIP?\\n* WOULD THAT ONE DEATH BE CONSIDERED A SUICIDE? WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE? PERSONALLY\\, MY VOTE IS FOR BOREDOM.","true":true}
