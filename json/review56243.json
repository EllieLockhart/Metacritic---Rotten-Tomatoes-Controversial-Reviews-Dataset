Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is....Terrible...just Terrible....\\nCharacters are boring\\, annoying\\, dumb\\, and pointless. The purple-haired admiral acts so egotistical and crazy and yet the director Rian Johnson wants us to side with her. Luke Skywalker has been ruined and is now a jerk who tried to kill someone. He is no longer wise of hopeful and the movie poops on him at every turn. Finn takes part in a boring subplot and a boring romance. Both of which could of been and should have been cut. The movie is full of quips and jokes that ruin the tone and flow of dramatic scenes. And plot points fro TFA are either dropped or answered in horrible ways. The fight scenes are poorly scripted. Even the music is so dull compared to earlier installments of the franchise. \\n\\nThe movie honestly feels like Rian Johns went out of his way to ruin Star Wars and has hate-boner for the franchise.","true":true}
