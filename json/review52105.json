Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the movie twice today\\, the first viewing I felt something was missing. So many questions and not enough of what I was expecting. However\\, after watching it literally 5hrs later\\, the second viewing helped greatly. After going in already knowing the outcome\\, the second viewing allowed me to focus more on the characters and look for more in each scene. Sure some things are still left answered\\, such as Snoke and who Rey's parents really are (I don't believe the movie's explanation at all). I put this movie at number 5 of the 9 Star Wars films to date. Not great but not terrible by any means.","true":true}
