Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like this movie did not have any continuity from the last Star Wars movie (episode VII) and the plot development was not complete and jumpy while not sufficiently continuing stories from the last episode. The story lines don't have any sense of saga. Is this a Rogue One? This was a disappointment worse than Ghostbusters remake.","true":true}
