Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*Might has well have got the OT boxset out on Sunset Boulevard\\, shat all over it on camera and saved a lot of people a lot of money. Rey's character development makes no sense whatsoever except to furiously virtue signal that with 0.5 days \\\"training\\\"\\, she can basically match Anakin's skill level from somewhere between AOTC and ROTS. Canon can go F itself basically. Luke is a jaded\\, burnt out and shadow of the optimistic farm boy we once knew. There's a half arsed attempt to justify this but it simply doesn't wash - Luke was abandoned\\, grew up thinking his father was murdered\\, saw his aunt and uncle's burning corpses\\, lost everything\\, had new hope\\, watched it literally blow up in his face\\, watched his mentor die\\, had his hand chopped off by the most reviled man in the known galaxy\\, seconds later revealed as his own father\\, has his sister's life hung before him as an attempt to break him\\, nearly kills his own father\\, and is goaded into doing so by Palpatine in encouragement to fulfil his destiny\\, only to refuse\\, throw his lightsaber away and face down the Dark Lord armed with nothing but faith. Yet we're supposed to believe that that same man has been on a 30 odd year sulk because he basically saw\/felt in Ben the same temptations\\, and thus did exactly what he didn't do with Sidious and whipped out his blade - however briefly? Just abandons Han and Leia because \\\"sorry I broke your kid - even though actually I knew it wasn't me all along because Gollum the undefeatable got there first....wait...what do you mean he's dead?\\\" No - just big fat fucking full on no. It shits repeatedly on Luke's character\\, resilience and flies directly in the face of everything he stood for. To be fair Mark Hamill absolutely nails it\\, his performance is flawless\\, beautifully haunting where called on\\, and easily goes way above and beyond the call of duty. It's a shining diamond in this otherwise shit heap of molten slag\\, and I had tears in my eyes on more than one occasion. His character assassination however is utterly unforgivable however\\, and it's a pretty poorly kept secret that Hamill himself was pretty pissed off with the story arc. We knew this trilogy wasn't about Han\/Leia\/Luke primarily\\, but frankly this is throwing away several thousand years worth of established fantasy lore into the garbage just to cash in - exactly what I knew would happen when Disney bought the franchise. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if Mickey Mouse makes a cameo in E.IX\\, and quite frankly\\, I couldn't give a flying fuck anymore - I'm off to read the Thrawn Trilogy again\\, and dream that somewhere\\, in a galaxy far far away\\, there's a film studio that made a sequel worthwhile of its mighty sires. This will please the kids and the uninitiated\\, but the Last Jedi even makes me look at Jar-Jar Binks in a way more sympathetic and nostalgic light","true":true}
