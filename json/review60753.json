First the trailer's lied to everyone swapping character models to make it look like one of the last of us beloved character's would be on a revenge adventure with ellie but that was a lie. The game has no replayabilty. since the game force you to play as a secret character for half of the game where the trailer never showed this \\\"secret\\\" character.This game left a bad taste in my mouth.

This Secret character kills the beloved character a 1 and half in the game and then they think you will like to play as this character for 10 hours. Plus it seems like ND game this new character more love then Ellie's story half. the new character gets better map designs and better weapons and made this character more friendly trying to make the player like her. They gave her alot of pretty cool boss fights while ellie just get  stealth encounter's. plus they up the looting in this game i felt like i been doing more looting then encounter's in this game. such a  time consuming process.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
