{"101487":150153,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally THE WORST Star Wars Movie I've EVER WATCHED. NOT due to lack of action\\, special effects or stupid Jar Jars... it FAILED miserable as it completely RUINED ALL of Star Wars mythology\\, Jedi force\\, the conflict of Sith and Jedi and made Luke Skywalker\\, my childhood hero a weak\\, old\\, useless past his time Jedi\\, NOTHING like how Obi One was portrayed! Similarly\\, while Luke had to get extensive Jedi training to be good at anything\\, and so was Anakin\\, Rey simply beat Kylo and Luke and others by just random forces! It's beyond pathetic! The whole going to the island was a waste of time\\, no training\\, no Jedi teachings\\, nothing! Stokes kill was pathetic\\, the whole Kylo Ren being a spoiled kid was weak\\, the SJW socialists non-sense was too much\\, Princess Leah somehow FLYING in the space back from explosion was stupid\\, dropping BOMB in the middle of space with no gravity\\, and WEAK unlikable characters were horrible and would NEVER generate any interest in the long run like the old movies did when I was a child.  Also\\, the last scene was an EPIC FAILURE\\, it was a complete insult to all of Luke fans that he did NOT participate in an actual light sabre fight\\, and it was his ghost. It was literally icing on the cake! I watched Star Wars as a child and have followed it ever since like nothing else in my life and Disney\\, Hollywood Elite and SJW culture RUINED IT FOR ME... FOREVER. I will skip the last movie as there's literally no character worth watching is left on the franchise.  I personally don't mind Rey\\, but they have butchered her character and her story is weak beyond belief!  So\\, overall SKIP this one\\, or watch it when it comes to TV or Netflix\\, not worth the $20 at the movies... specially if you are a long-term fan of the original trilogy.","true":true}
