Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I forgot if I was watching Star Wars or a scene from Mary Poppins at some point. I can't believe the direction they took in several creative decisions throughout the movie. This movie rates worse than the Prequel Trilogy put together. It's as if they wanted to make a cool\\, darker\\, and more gritty movie like Rogue One\\, but then someone came in with the editing hammer to ensure nothing sad or meaningful happens to any of your old favorties or your new favorites. Read the book for this\\, it will piss you off a lot less.","true":true}
