Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A joke filled mess\\, I almost left the theater. If you love the story of Luke Skywalker and take the legacy seriously\\, don't go see this movie. Disney means death to George Lucas's Star Wars that started all of this. I understand it's time to leave the old and move on but this movie is so disrespectful to the original story it's painful. Enjoy your billions\\, Disney.","true":true}
