Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this movie horribly confused\\, disappointed\\, and regretful. Confusion = incohesive storylines\\, nonsensical plot twists\\, abrupt dismissals of storylines started in the Force Awakens\\, and unbelievable (even in the sci-fi realm) fight sequences. Disappointed = None of my questions were truly answered but more dismissed\\, horrible over the top attempts at comedy\\, new direction for characters seems so pointless\\, secondary characters relegated to adhoc suicide runs multiple times throughout the film for apparently no reason at all. Regretful = I no longer have any interest in vesting more time into this franchise.","true":true}
