Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fuel... A concept previously non-existent in the Star Wars universe\\, now a crucial\\, central feature. Idiotic\\, stubborn refusal to discuss plans. Useless subplots that don't enhance\\, enrich\\, or even resonate with the main arc. Ignoring the foundation material upon which the universe \/ franchise was built. Women being just as pompous and domineering as the men they accuse of the same. Wasting characters we have come to care for\\, even on the most basic level (like Poe and Finn) to be punched up like pi\u00c3\u00b1atas as an effigy of misogyny and unearned female superiority. Lord! There's not a signal sign that any of the women glorified in this film were actual\\, real leaders... Not even Leia! And I find that not only insulting to my female leader hero (PRINCESS Leia)\\, but to women in general... You have to earn it\\, and then you have to maintain it with consistency... What I saw unfold on screen was neither of those things. That right there tells me that this movie's real goal was to make people despise women\\, and push us back down. Oh\\, and the storytelling was lazy\\, the action an insult to science and to The Force\\, and the developments between Rey and Kylo wasted and unrealistic.","true":true}
