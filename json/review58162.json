Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. Where do I start......\\n\\n1. Killing potentially the best villain in the SW universe in a few seconds\\, with no justification or back story\\n\\n2. Rey\/s origins equally hyped\\, with no fulfilment\\n\\n3. Phasma EQUALLY hyped\\, then serving utterly no purpose other than to sell her backstory book\\n\\n4. Turning one of the most important film icons of our (or any) generation from an optimistic and powerful figure into a grumpy grandfather and killing him off\\n\\n4. Yet more of Kylo Ren being an angsty\\, whiny teenager\\n\\n5. ForceTiming. I mean what.\\n\\n6. A pointless non-sequitur of an ultimately pointless mission\\, clearly just devised to show off effects and the director's 'imagination'\\n\\n7. The supposed-to-be psychopathic\\, evil driving force of the First Order reduced to an absolute laughing stock\\n\\n8. Leia's space Mary Poppins moment\\n\\nThat's just a start on what was wrong with this utter failure to the legacy of Star Wars. Do one Rian Johnson","true":true}
