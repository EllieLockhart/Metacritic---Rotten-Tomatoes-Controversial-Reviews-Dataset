Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have really enjoyed the start wars films since I was a child. The original trilogy inspired me as a child\\, and I even enjoyed the prequal trilogy (although I admit that the script was weak I placed\\, the story was consistent and good).\\nWhen they announced star wars was coming back\\, I was so excited. \\nI pre booked ticket for the first Disney start wars movie\\, and did the same for the last jedi. \\nI will not pay for another Disney star wars product after being burned by the last jedi.\\nThis is easily the biggest mess of a film.\\nI don't understand why Disney thought they could entirely swap directors\/ writers in a trilogy and have a consistent story. \\nThis movie had a decent set up from the force awakens\\, but destroys every plot thread and offers no introduction into the next star wars film.\\nThere are some good scenes\\, and I do like Kylo as a character (and he is cast very well\\, I feel he is proping up a poor script). I like the scene where Kylo sees Luke on the ice planet\\, and they \\\"fight\\\". Really good scene. \\nThe rose and fin story is a waste of time\\, the main plot of a space chase is ridiculous\\, and what they did to Luke is pathetic.\\nI'm so disappointed. I wanted to love these films. I'm left so empty.","true":true}
