Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie\\, great effects\\, no too many slow parts. However there were a couple head scratching moments. One would be how short Rey's training with Luke was. It was basically two scenes\\, while Luke's with yoda back in the original trilogy was much more in dept and longer. The other moment would be the whole Finn and Rose and the code breaker part which just never needed to happen. They basically put themselves in danger for no reason at all. But besides these blemishes I loved it.","true":true}
