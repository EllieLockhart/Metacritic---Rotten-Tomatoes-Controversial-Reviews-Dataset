Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. All those questions from the force awakens ? Answered with a thud? No explanation on snoke? Never get to see Luke use his light saber again. Luke is just an old man and Leah can glide thru space apparently.  Why were they riding out with those old mining speeders? And then bail? That's all we get about snoke? Sooo Rea is a nobody? Who can pick up a light saber and defeat Kylo ren? I guess Vader was a weak stick practicing and training all those years. What was yoda smoking? I want some. Everything Starwars was just crapped on my Rian. Jar jar would've been a star in this movie.","true":true}
