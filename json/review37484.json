Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some entretaining secuences\\, some good humor and Mark Hamill performance was great.   However the plot is weak\\, very very basic storytelling. Most characters are poorly developed. The worst Star Wars film so far in my opinion. I think Rian Johnson is to blame. This is the only Star Wars film that i've disliked ever. Even the prequels delivered\\, for what they were. They weren't great but were ok.\\nThis movie reminds me of Batman vs Superman. People that love the mindless spectacle will like it. People that ask for coherent storytelling will not.","true":true}
