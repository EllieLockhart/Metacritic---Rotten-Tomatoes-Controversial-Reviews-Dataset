Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can be said about this atrocity of a movie that has not already been stated? For me\\, the saga ends with The Force Awakens. I'm going to pretend that the last jedi & all future Star Wars movies do not exist. JJA\\, RJ & KK can go whatever direction they want with this property\\, but I won't be along for the ride. I choose to keep my childhood heroes in their previous\\, ulaltered state.","true":true}
