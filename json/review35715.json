Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a very good movie\\, but I feel bad about all the controversy surrounding the film\\, the actors\\, the director\\, and even Lucasfilm and the Walt Disney Company.  While not perfect\\, it's a great message with growing beyond past mistakes and moving forward to a better conclusion.","true":true}
