Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you liked The Force Awakens\\, everything it set up\\, and the questions you wanted answered to then this isn\u2019t the movie for you. But if you watch it anyways\\, subvert your expectations. You\u2019ll thank me later.","true":true}
