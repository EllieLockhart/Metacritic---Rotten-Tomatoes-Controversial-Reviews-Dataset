Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is just kind of...off. Without heading into spoiler territory\\, there are far too many plot holes. Besides this\\, the plot arc is poorly written. Rather then following a traditional story structure\\, there are multiple climaxes that serve to undermine each other - a punchy moment is less punchy when there are four of them in quick succession. But most of all\\, the movie doesn't feel Star Wars. It feels like they try to make the movie more like Marvel while keeping it Star Wars esque\\, and as a result it does neither particularly well. It is neither a traditional feel-good story nor is it a dark and gritty movie\\, and trying to do both at once means the whole is disjointed and fails to flow. Two stars.","true":true}
