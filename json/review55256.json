Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lacked the spirit of Star Wars. The spirit of Star Wars is not Luke\\, Leia\\, or the Falcon. It is aliens and sci fi landscapes (which are not just there as tokens). The movie lacked the pacing\\, characterization\\, and styling of Star Wars.","true":true}
