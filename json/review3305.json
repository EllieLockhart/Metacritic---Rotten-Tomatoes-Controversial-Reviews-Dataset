Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been thinking abit about new Starwars movie the last jedi. As a big Starwars fan and I had high hopes. I watched it over Christmas and after seeing i was uncertain how I felt but I knew I was disappointed. \\n\\nThe more I thought about it the more I disliked it. I really disliked the direction they took with Luke. It was just to distant from the hero we know and we weren't told enough to make it believable. Luke now a coward a complete opposite to the ultimate hero like that in original trilogy.\\nLuke really adds little to the story and apart from the stupid ending Luke might as well not be in it. \\nYet it seemed the 2nd episode was suppose to be all about Luke?\\n\\nUnfunny jokes\\, a strange and boring slow chase space battle. Rey character seems go no where and has no challenges to overcome\\, makes no mistakes and doesn't grow in character so she seems unrealistic. \\n\\nRey's parent plot goes nowhere. Stupid Yoda scene\\, where a force ghost can cause lightning. \\nUnsatisfying plot for Snoke\\, he just dies too easily.\\nLittle space ships destroying big ones because of a hyper drive\\, mmm thats dumb idea\\, why have laser cannons when you can just fly ships with hyper drives it other ships....\\n\\n\\nPointless Walker scene with silly slow moving big cannon\\, why wouldn't they land closer...\\nWhy can't they just bomb the planet....\\n\\nWhy are the first order so dumb\\, with stupid men.\\nAll the villains are stupid\\, and it's never explained why they are so evil so I can't understand them\\, and they don't seem real. Also only one female villain Phasma who's story is wasted again.\\n\\nAlso why are all the rebel men suddenly stupid too. Poe a hero in The Force Awakens\\, is not a reckless mutineer and this ruins his character. Finn is now like Ja Ja Binks with annoying clownish behavior and if he wasn't in the movie I wouldn't have missed him.\\nRose was wasted opportunity\\, he story arc seemed pointless\\, and again I wouldn't of missed her if she wasn't in the movie.\\n\\nWhere are the bounty hunters and interesting evil aliens.\\nEhhh. \\nWhere is the view of what the First Order is trying to achieve and what they do next..\\n\\nIt just doesn't make any sense for a 2nd movie in a triology\\, or tie in properly with the other movies.\\nSo disappointing and unsatisfying.\\nIt's complete ruined Starwars for me.\\nI won't be excited to see episode 9 because I don't see how it can be fixed. There is also nothing interesting to look forward to. Nothing was setup for the next movie.\\n\\nWhat's good about it? definitely visually pleasing\\, and sounds good.\\nIf you're not a big starwars fan or if you consider this movie unrelated to the starwars universe then it's more pleasing. \\nIf you enjoy seeing female Rebel leaders who are supposedly smart but really tactical light weights fighting and winning against even more brain dead white men in the evil first order empire\\, then this movie is for you!","true":true}
