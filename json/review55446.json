Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. There were a few things to like scattered amongst the mess. Luke milking a sea cow? Leia space surfing without a suit? Snoke killed with a cheap trick? The entire casino side quest that was a waste of 30 minutes? BB8 fixing an X-wing by using his head as a hammer? Porgs? Caretakers (fish nuns)? The one light saber fight was cool\\, but that's about it.","true":true}
