Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually had to change my review on this one. Last Jedi is a bit like a great tasting meal that gives you terrible indigestion. The more I thought about\\, the more I realised I just didn't like it. Worse\\, I flat out hated it. From Akbars ignominious death to Luke turning into a broken failure ready to betray everything he'd believed in\\, it just crashes and burns on so many levels. ","true":true}
