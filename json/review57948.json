Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What's most frustrating is\\, if you enjoy good story telling\\, depth and detail\\, this movie has absolutely none of that.  Going further still\\, it willfully seeks to destroy ANY sense of depth\\, almost as if it was an attempt to sabotage the franchise.  What's being interpreted as \\\"fan\\\" anger for not getting what we expected is in fact anger and dissatisfaction with what is an empty film with absolutely no connections to any of the other films\\, even The Force Awakens!!!  It's just got that horrid template feel to it that gets applied to any Disney \\\"adventure\\\" movie.  The entire Finn storyline has been pointless and only served to be a good time to take a break.  This movie won't stand the test of time despite initial audience enjoyment.  But hey\\, it's Star Wars right?  Who cares\\, it's going to make money anyway.","true":true}
