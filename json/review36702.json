Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie not have martial arts\\, they use a lot of jokes and is very slow movie. A lot of verbal  explanations not is good for progress.  A lot of Wrong Especial effects  (super slow motion matrix) destroy the film and the new caracther not have  history.","true":true}
