Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a stinking pile of crap. Way to go Disney\\, you suck at Star Wars again!\\n\\nSo much of the plot is a complete copy of ESB. What the hell kind of plot element was with the 18 hour chase in space??? The humor\\, though funny\\, was completely out of place. The sub plots were terrible. The social commentary also way out of place. Disney destroyed a beloved character. The only thing good about the film were some of the visuals.","true":true}
