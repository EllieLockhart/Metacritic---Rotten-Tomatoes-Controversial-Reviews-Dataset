It's an absolute roller-coaster of feelings. Nope\\, it won't go the old-fashioned \\\"good versus evil\\\" way with tough guys and weak women\\, it's a very modern story\\, even with same-sex feelings. If you're \\\"too tough\\\" for standing that\\, just leave it; it'll just make you angry. But if you're open-minded\\, the game will make you laugh\\, love\\, hate and everything in between.Also\\, and that's why it's modern and very brave for an expensive triple-A title\\, it sheds light to \\\"the bad side\\\" too\\, by switching perpectives. Like many outstanding movies that make you ponder (21 Grams\\, L.A. Crash\\, BABEL\\, The Thin Red Line\\, ...)\\, the game shows that your enemies have their own issues\\, reasonable motives and feelings\\, too. Just like enemies (=people) in real-life would.Usually\\, this is not a topic for games as its easier to write a one-sided story and simpler to digest for the consuments. But it also won't make you THINK about it. Now we have some **** storms and (stupid) petitions\\, so ND did something right.  ;) PS: TLOU2 is also not a game for children\\, it is VERY (because realistically) brutal and contains some sex scenes\\, too. Just saying. If you own a PS4\\, PLAY THIS GAME!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
