Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an utter disappointment. Rian Johnson was given a tremendous gift to work with some of the most compelling and beloved characters in all of literature and film. Yet too often Johnson failed to capitalize on these legendary characters' storytelling potential\\, and in other moments displayed a clumsy disregard for any of their qualities that made them cherished for decades. The comedic elements felt forced and shallow\\, and much of what J. J. Abrams established in The Force Awakens is trivialized (or completely undone) in careless yet permanent plot decisions by Johnson. Overall\\, the movie is guilty of being one long series of shameless misdirections that is too preoccupied in its goal in always \\\"fooling\\\" the audience that it forgets to deliver a meaningful story in the process. The Star Wars lore is too majestic (and too important to too many people) to be reduced to cheep gags and needless surprise twists. Frankly put\\, the hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans deserve better.","true":true}
