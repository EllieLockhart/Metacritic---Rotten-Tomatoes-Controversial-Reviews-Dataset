Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was seriously underwhelmed and confused. The pointless subplots made me feel stupid for even caring. The hyperspeed ship thing seemed like a massive cop-out. And Mary Poppins Leia\\, why didn't they just let her die? Animal milking? Why do good guys in Star Wars only exist to \\\"resist\\\" or \\\"rebel\\\" from bad guys? Their existence and countless deaths seem completely pointless. And now there are only like 20 of them left?","true":true}
