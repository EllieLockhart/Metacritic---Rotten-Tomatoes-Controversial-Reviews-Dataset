Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This only looks like Star Wars\\, but it's not!!! I refuse to accept the writing and direction of this movie. the 1 and a half star goes to the great visual presentation and music. The story telling\\, character development\\, plot holes\\, wasted potential to build up on the foundations layed in the previous episode ... sigh .. what a let down.","true":true}
