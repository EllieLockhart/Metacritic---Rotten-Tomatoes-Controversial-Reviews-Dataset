Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is pirate a carribean with futuristic timeline.\\nDoes not feel like star wars at all.\\nI should not watch it....it was better with out it. Force awaken was awesome..but not this movie......","true":true}
