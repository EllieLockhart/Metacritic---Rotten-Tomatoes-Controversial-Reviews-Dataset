Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you look at this movie and only this movie\\, you might think that it wasn't bad\\, maybe even good. But if you look at it as a Star Wars movie\\, and how it should fit with the other films in their universe you could see what a colossal pile of garbage it was. I am sick of it being praised' by critics for \\\"subverting expectation''. Everything that TFA set up for the new trilogy\\, which made us want more\\, was shut down in an underwhelming manner that let anyone who gave a damn about the franchise down. George Lucas\\, the creater of the star wars franchise stated that star wars is meant to \\\"rhyme\\\"\\, something which Rian Johnson is happy to throw under the bus to \\\"subvert expectations\\\". It's almost as if Rian Johnson hadn't seen any Star Wars films\\, because it seems as if he has no idea how things work in this universe (looking at you hyperspace ram). Also\\, I remember when  star wars was the simple good vs evil theme\\, and not stuffed with virtue signalling like the \\\"Poe's toxic masculinity vs the calm female leader Holdo\\\". This movie was clearly made by someone who doesn't care about the fans\\, people who really care about this franchise\\, and instead opting to attack them on social media.","true":true}
