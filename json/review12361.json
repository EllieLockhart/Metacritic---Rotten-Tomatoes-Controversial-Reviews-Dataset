Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am waiting for the Lucas special edition where disposable character Vice Adm. Holdo is replaced with cg Admiral Ackbar for hero's death. Also\\, replace Captain Phasma with that tall lady from game of thrones. Then\\, cut those scenes because they are unnecessary. Maybe\\, also\\, make Luke Skywalker's spear for fishing longer for effect. Other than that\\, it was an ok Star Wars Story.","true":true}
