Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great disappointment. \\n\\nThis movie failed to deliver on both the promises that were set in the Force Awakens and to be a good movie on its own. Plot holes\\, a type of humour that has no place in Star Wars films\\, unnecessary plot devices\\, wasted opportunities\\, poorly written characters and absolutely no story development what so ever.\\nThe movie was a cash grab for Disney as everyone will see this movie.\\n\\nLet's just say the Hobbit trilogy is less of a disappointment.","true":true}
