Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Script writing terrible\\nVisually good\\nCast selection poor\\nCringed at far to much \\nCould of walked out happily \\nGood story poor execution \\nThe cgi characters like the dogs and at the casino looked like a men in black movie.\\nWas hoping for a darker Luke not comedy like yoda.\\nThings blow up far to easy again!!\\nSold all my Star Wars memorabilia because I felt it was embarrassing to be linked with this rubbish.\\nForget how good Harrison ford was without him.\\n\\nHalf a star isn't unfair it was on par with home alone 3","true":true}
