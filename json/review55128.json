Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't sure what to think of it upon the first viewing. I watched it in 3D\\, which I would not recommend for this movie\\, because the 3D effect in one of the earliest shots immediately took me out of it (the camera is very quickly passing by various spaceships\\, many of which look like 2D cutouts zooming towards you). But probably more than that were the directions the movie took various characters and some of the (very surprising) plot twists. Also the humor. It all felt so different. \\n\\nI wasn't sure how it would all ultimately fit into what the original trilogy -- and to a large degree\\, The Force Awakens and even Rogue One -- established; if it would stick out like a sore thumb (or even worse\\, feel like an insult to everything that came before it) or if it would add something new and essential much like The Empire Strikes Back did. But I was leaning towards the former after that first viewing. I actually thought that I might in fact hate The Last Jedi and no longer be interested in following this new trilogy. I was feeling pretty crestfallen. But I needed to see it again\\, after the shock of the new wore off\\, with whatever hopes and expectations I had brought into the first viewing fully purged\\, and without the 3D glasses.\\n\\nAnd lo and behold\\, it actually turned out to be the latter. Most of the jokes and gags that I somewhat cringed at during the first viewing were plain fun and felt right at home in the Star Wars universe during the second. The plot and character motivations\/arcs made so much more sense and in fact struck me as quite brilliantly conceived and executed. And the emotional impact... I've never cried so much and had so many goosebumps while watching a Star Wars movie\\, ever. I have to say\\, I'm pretty sure this is my favorite Star Wars movie since Empire. \\n\\nThe only things keeping me from giving this a perfect score are some elements of the middle section that momentarily broke the spell a little for me\\, and how busy the plot is\\, whereas Empire kept the plot so perfectly and beautifully simple throughout. But man\\, I can't wait to watch it again with friends and family so we can all talk about it for hours. That's the beauty of this one; maybe more than any other installment\\, The Last Jedi is really packed with ideas and questions and just amazing\\, inspiring beauty and emotion that will fuel a ton of contemplation and discussion for a long time to come. I have the feeling that a lot of my fellow longtime fans who had a similar reaction to mine on that first viewing will have a similar change of heart after seeing it again\\, and that it'll go down as one of the very best installments ever.","true":true}
