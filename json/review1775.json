Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan this film was very disappointing\\, there where many flaws in the film with little to no explanation to the plot elements. It's obvious this film was poorly written with no sense of direction and storylines that made no sense to the overall story. Overall its a massive slap to the face to many Star Wars fans.","true":true}
