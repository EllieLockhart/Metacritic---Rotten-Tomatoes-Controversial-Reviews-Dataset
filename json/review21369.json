Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will say the first time i saw this movie i didn't like it. I feel like the Star Wars franchise thinks sequels = $$$. And as long as they have people spending money to see it then they will make money.","true":true}
