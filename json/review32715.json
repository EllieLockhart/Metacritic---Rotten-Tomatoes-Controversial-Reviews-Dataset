Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi may prove to be a more divisive film in the saga. But with it\u2019s beautifully directed sequences\\, powerful performances\\, and some great twists and unexpected surprises Episode VIII will stand the test of time just like the 1977 original","true":true}
