Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOT the best since Empire and for sure not better than Empire but a good installment. Some great action scenes and also some emotional scenes. I do think they added in too much humour though. Group of us went\\, we all enjoyed it overall.","true":true}
