Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes me not to ever watch a Disney SW film ever agin It ruins everything I loved about SW And the logic behind everything made  zero sense although It was cool to look at and amazing acting by Adam Diver It's still a 2 star film. #NOTMYLUKE","true":true}
