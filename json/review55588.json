Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOTE: Apparently rating this movie as either a Half-Star or Not Interested results in Rotten Tomatoes discounting your rating from the total audience score.  We all know that if RT was counting ALL of the half star reviews\\, that the audience score would be hovering somewhere in the high 20s.  Way to shill for the Mouse\\, RT!  Here is my review reposted with a whopping one star to make sure that RT's algorithms pick up my vote.\\n\\nSJW Wars\\nEpisode VIII\\nThe Fans Strike Back\\n\\nIt is a dark time for the RESISTANCE.  Although Luke Skywalker has been successfully deconstructed\\, the Patriarchy has driven the brave SJWs from their hidden fortresses on Vox\\, Polygon\\, and Gawker\\, and spread complaints about the low quality of THE LAST JEDI across the galaxy.\\n\\nEvading the dreaded Rotten Tomatoes User Score and plummeting box office numbers\\, a group of virtue-signallers led by Misandrist-Prime\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, has established new Safe-Spaces on colleges and in high-tech corporations across the fruited plains of America.\\n\\nThe dreaded white-males\\, angered by the deconstruction of their beloved hero\\, continue to dispatch tens-of-thousands of negative reviews on the abomination which is THE LAST JEDI into the far reaches of the internet.","true":true}
