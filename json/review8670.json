Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Five things that make this movie the worst Star Wars movie ever made and the most disappointing film that I've ever seen....\\n1) Underdeveloped characters\\, too many characters\\, lack of character arcs which mean that what characters do in this film don't make sense.\\n2) Constantly building up a situation only for it to be knocked down.  This isn't big\\, it isn't clever and when it happens constantly it makes the film totally underwhelming.\\n3) Terrible\\, lame humour\\, badly timed. Urgh.\\n4) The killing off of key characters without reason\\, logic or care.\\n5) The film felt like it was making fun of Star Wars and its fans.  I'm surprised a caption didn't appear at the end of the film saying \\\"Ha! Did you like Star Wars..... I bet you don't anymore - loser!!\\\"","true":true}
