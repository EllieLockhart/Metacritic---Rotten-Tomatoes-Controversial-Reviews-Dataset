Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this is the most boring and plot hold movie I've ever seen. I don't even know where to start. First off the passing of the movie is all over the place and that Casino scene just drags on to long and slows the movie down to a snails pace. Second the chase through space doesnt make sense with the rest of the star wars lore on space travel. Also the space chase is extremely boring\\, many movies have done similar chase scenes way better like the Mad Max franchise for instance. Third most of the interesting stuff is only mentioned in the movie rather than shown\\, like Rey finding a way off of Snokes ship\\, I would've loved to see Rey do some bad ass fighting as she fought her way off the ship or even sneaking around till she found an escape pod. Fourth this film brings nothing new to the franchise just copies other star wars films and their scenes but only half as good if not worse. Finally the movie has no true tone to it\\, its a big mix of tones that don't fit right all together. I truly have no words on how to describe how badly this films tone is. I do hope that JJ can do much better with the final film in this trilogy however I'm not holding my breath as Ryan Johnson has truly screwed up this trilogy.","true":true}
