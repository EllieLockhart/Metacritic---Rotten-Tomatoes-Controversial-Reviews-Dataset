Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an exhilarating\\, incredible movie filled with all the humor\\, drama\\, and action that makes icon films truly great.  It had visually stunning elements\\, a powerful story\\, and memorable\\, endearing characters.\\n\\n It's a turn that Star Wars needed to take\\, and is\\, I feel\\, the best movie of the franchise.","true":true}
