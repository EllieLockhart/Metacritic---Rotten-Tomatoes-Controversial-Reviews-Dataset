Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though I admit there is some disconnect in tone between episodes VII and VIII I was overall delighted with this installment of the WS franchises. I am long time SW fan and I love IV trough VI so I understand that some are upset about how characters from the those movies are sent to the background but I understand that these are SW movies for the next generation of fans. Rey\\, Kylo\\, Fin and Poe should be the focus of these new films. I like the complexity of Luke's struggle with the idea of destroying the Jedi order. I could use less of the political commentary that seems to be foreced into the film\\, but that has been a part of these films for a long time. This movie was lengthy but never felt that way. It as fun\\, exhilarating and moving. I look forward to my second viewing.","true":true}
