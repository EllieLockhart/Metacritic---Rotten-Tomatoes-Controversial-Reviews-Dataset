Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fear for the sanity of anyone who walked out of the theater thinking this was a good movie or even a solidly mediocre one. The Holdo\/Poe clash is being held up as a clever twist meant to teach Poe a lesson when it was more like a shambolic episode of Three's Company. The Resistance is down to a handful of people and Holdo looks at Poe fully knowing he's a trigger-happy reckless flyboy and for some unfathomable reason decides to keep him in the dark about the plan and to antagonize him. At the very least they could have thrown in even half a line about some concern that there might be a mole on the shop and thus the need for so much pointless secrecy. A story about infighting within the Resistance could have been fascinating but this just made everyone involved look alarmingly stupid.\\n\\nI give that example simply because I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw so many people praise it. The rest of the writing is just as bad. The only saving grace is the acting by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega\\, who both manage to transcend the asinine moronic stories and dialogue they were given to work with but I'm afraid it felt like watching a drama school class where students have to read the phone book or Sesame Street dialogue but hit certain emotional cues.","true":true}
