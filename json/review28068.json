Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot is critically narrow in scope both in time (plot takes place over the course of less than 2 days) and scope (only 3 plants are featured in the film). This is not reflected in the runtime of 2 1\/2 hours.","true":true}
