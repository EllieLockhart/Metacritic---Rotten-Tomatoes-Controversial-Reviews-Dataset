Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am convinced the Critics were paid or were afraid of saying what they really thought\\, that is my only conclusion to their scores. Honestly\\, 90% of you critics seem so scared to say what you really thought.\\n\\nWhile The Last Jedi had fleeting moments of nostalgia\\, they were far and few between with often a soundtrack accompanying them that ignited an internal conflict.. \\\"am I watching Star Wars or Snow White?\\\" From the utterly wasted opportunities to the final battle - it was the most dissapointment I have ever felt leaving the cinema.\\n\\nNow let me be straight\\, this was a good movie. It had everything you sort of wanted\\, laughs\\, action\\, unbelievable science fiction - but it was also a bad movie. \\n\\nBad for old school starwars fans\\, and apparently great for kids who never saw the original in the theatre and who really don't know any better\\, so I can't blame them for the fanboy love.","true":true}
