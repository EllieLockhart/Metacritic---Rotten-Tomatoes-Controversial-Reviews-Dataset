The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It is really sad to read reviews written during the day one with only 0. If you pay attention reading most of them\\, you will find many elements that show you that the reviewer hasn't played the game.About the game\\, this is the opinion of a guy who played everything since he discovered videogames\\, and a guy who has never been a huge fan of the first chapter. In this case I can't but admit that TLOU Part 2 is one of the greatest masterpiece in the history of the medium. The screenplay is a magestic work of characterization\\, developing this double pursue\\, a double tale of revenge. But if you really understand the game\\, you won't find a revenge story. You'll find the best sequel ever made to a game\\, and Naughty Dog made some of the most extreme choices towards the public and the mythology of the game. The result is an enormous tale-of-doubles which developes the great lie which closed the first chapter in an incredibile whirlpool of violence and brutality.The gameplay is a continuous and total integration with the awesome scenarios that have been realized in the best graphic level ever seen on ps4. The gameplay of tlou has been renewed in its rhythm\\, often ripetiteve and sometimes a bit woody. Tlou offers a range of genres and situations\\, and some of them are already game history. The level with the sniper or the sequence on Serafites' Island are nothing but works of videloudic art.Surely it was inspired by the operas of the genre\\, especially MGS 4\\, but it founds its own identity in those hard choices ND took. When you discover that after 15 hours of progression with Allie your adventure is gone and you restart with her nemesis who killed the beloved Joel\\, you'll need time to accept this. But it's not a punishment against player\\, it's a new pact with the player\\, who will live actually an experience\\, not a game. And when the true finale comes\\, the picture is complete\\, Joel is not the one who inspires revenge\\, but the man who condemned Allie saving her. So she is not looking for vengeance\\, but she's trying to overcome hatreness against that friend-father.Yes\\, TLOU totally overwrites the first chapter\\, but this is nothing but an incredibile pivot point in ND philosophy. It's a matter of faith\\, and everyone should overcome his preconceptions to embrace this masterpiece\\, which completed the path that Death Stranding seemed to have completed. The videogame has finally reach\\, completely and irreversible\\, the state of art.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
