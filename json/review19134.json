Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s incredibly entertaining\\, almost every joke hits its mark\\, and the acting starts off slow\\, to be honest\\, but by the end everyone gives a great performance. The film gives twists and turns\\, some unwanted\\, but hits its stride. It\u2019s not the best Star Wars film\\, but its very entertaining and is more than worth a watch. ","true":true}
