Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Convinced some of these top critics are being paid by disney. Flat characters\\, pointless sub-plots and cringey jokes were a few of my major gripes. This movie was like going to a five star restaurant and getting served a Big Mac. They went in a completely different direction and the film missed its mark completely. But don't worry! Us haters are just sexist trolls or something. Christ.","true":true}
