Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan. This movie was fantastic. It is right up there with Empire\\, in my opinion. I don't really get all the hate from supposed Star Wars fans. The movie took chances and kept you guessing the whole time. It was probably the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time.","true":true}
