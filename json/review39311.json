Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a huge middle finger to the heroes and themes of the prior films.  There is no debating that.  I am not even saying that it wasn't worth trying out... but what kind of moron couldn't see the push back coming?  Especially when nothing was provided in its stead?  Star Wars is a quasi-religion for many.  Wishing that it wasn't certainly isn't going to recover any credibility.  Some good acting and amazing production wasted on a broken story\\, IMHO.  The Rebellion was lost with The Last Jedi.","true":true}
