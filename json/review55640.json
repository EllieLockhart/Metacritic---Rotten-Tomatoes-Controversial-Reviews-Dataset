Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not very good. No backstory on anything\\, tossed out all the potential of TFA. Spent a lot of time on the island with no answers... I felt like i was watching lost. Humor was childish and over done. Lots of space battles and the millennium falcon flew through tight spaces \\, again. The porg were useless tribble wannabes. This movie is the epitome of hollywood milking people's nostalgia for the past of good movies while putting no effort into actually meaningful or moving stories. If this movie wasn't star wars it would be a huge flop. huge. TFA bombed in parts too\\, but this was like flushing your childhood down the toilet. They should have just done a live action kyle katarn movie rather than steal plot elements and rebrand. I regret wasting time and money on this commercialized pile of Disney.","true":true}
