Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First complaint: Screw you Rotten Tomatoes...no way this movie is still sitting at 51% audience score.  Do you even read your customer's reviews?  The vast majority of reviews I read are not positive.  I would wager that the audience score is more like 35-40%.\\n\\nSecond:  Screw you critics.  You are nothing but shills for Disney.  There is no way that 91% of professional critics (who are supposed to know a thing or two about what makes a good movie) found this garbage to be tolerable\\, let alone good.\\n\\nThird: Screw you Rose Tico.  You and your annoying lectures about evil rich people sucked any life that could have been in this movie.\\n\\nFourth: Screw you Rian Johnson for what you did to Luke and Leia.  Luke is a curmudgeon and Leia is Peter Pan.  Nice.\\n\\nFifth: Screw you Disney.  This was a horrible movie that should have never have seen the light of day.  You ruined this franchise by allowing this movie to be viewed by the general public.  I will not watch another Star Wars movie or story put out by you.","true":true}
