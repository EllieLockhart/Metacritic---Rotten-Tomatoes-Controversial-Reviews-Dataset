Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this movie better than The Force Awakens. Overall it was fun and worth how long of a movie it was. My only gripe is the continued removal of the characters from the original trilogy every movie in this trilogy. Is there really a need to kill off every character? Even without finally seeing one of your favorite characters reveal being a lesser hero than they were in ROTJ. Very irritating. Otherwise great movie\\, and worth seeing multiple times. ","true":true}
