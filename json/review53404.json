Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Essentially there's two movies in one... one of which is not good\\, verging on terrible\\, and the other (kylo\/rey storyline) is pretty good. Dislike: 1. Rose - unecessary\\, cheesy\\, preechy\\, awkwardly shoed in and a waste of valuable screen time. 2. Too many deus ex machina moments (looking at you space superman Leia) and too many cringy Disney teenage tv show type jokes. 3. Random animal cruelty message was just weird and out of place. 4. Overall dumbed down feel to the plot\\, the dialogue\\, everything... like I was watching a movie meant for 12-13 year olds. 5. Lack of scale to the universe. Something about everything happening felt small and insignificant. The wonder and excitement of the Star Wars universe was missing. 5. Handling of Snoke was terrible 6. Boring subplot = biggest problem. The subplot was boring\/lame and that may be generous...","true":true}
