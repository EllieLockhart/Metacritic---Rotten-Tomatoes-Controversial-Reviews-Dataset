Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a lifetime of following the Star Wars story\\, reading books\\, playing video games\\, reading comics\\, watching The Empire Strikes back over and over again. I was excited and satisfied after seeing The Force Awakens. I anticipated The Last Jedi\\, and went to see it opening night. \\n\\nI was so disappointed. The only movie worse than The Last Jedi\\, is Pirates of the Caribbean 4. It was as if Rian Johnson\\, wanted to say \\\"F YOU\\\" to Star Wars fans\\, Lawrence Kasdan\\, and J.J. Abrams\\, as if he literally wanted to troll us and disrespect us by disrespecting the stories and characters we had grown to love over the course of decades. This was a movie so bad\\, that now I don't want to watch episode 7\\, which was a pretty good film. I don't want to wear Star Wars apparel or rep this franchise\\, because I don't want to be misconstrued to be of such poor taste that I might be a fan of this mess of a film. If you have not seen this film and are a Star Wars fan\\, I suggest that you just skip this one so that at least The Force Awakens will still be good. If you watch The Last Jedi\\, it might ruin The Force Awakens for you. It will take a miracle for J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan to clean up the mess of this film when they create Episode 9.","true":true}
