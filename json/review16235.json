Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a huge star wars fan\\, but I love all the original movies\\, they are classics and I watched them a few times during my childhood.  I wasn't a fan of the previous \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, but this is just as bad if not worse.  The acting feels so out of place...Kylo Ren always looks like he's about to cry\\, not terrifying like a sith lord should be.  Luke says some weird one liners...theres parts that are obviously forced writing to be funny.  I know the originals had funny moments\\, but they took themselves seriously.  That was part of the magic.  The last jedi doesn't even to take itself seriously.  It seems to make fun of itself constantly\\, like when Rey is training with Luke.  There are so many weird moments...I just cant endorse this film.  I wanted to like it\\, so bad.  But I can't.  There are great fight scenes and space battles\\, which is the only reason I don't give it one star.  Sorry Disney\\, it's just not star wars anymore.","true":true}
