Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A travesty. The writing\\, the characters just everything in this movie is so subpar its not even funny.  Marvel like jokes that makes you hate being a Star Wars fan\\, the use of the Force in this movie makes absolutely zero sense. Major plotpoints unexplained or going nowhere. I just watched the murder of Star Wars on the big screen","true":true}
