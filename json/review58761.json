Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"One of the best games I played this year. Despite all the controversy\\, I think that as a whole the story is beautifully harsh and real. It tells a story of a girl who got her heartbroken and lost herself to anger. And on the flip side\\, it\u2019s also a story of redemption. Joel\u2019s actions affected Abby. Abby\u2019s actions affected Ellie. Ellie\u2019s actions affected Abby. It\u2019s a cycle of violence that stopped when they decided not to kill each other. When Ellie made the choice not to kill her.\r\rThe ending\\, however bittersweet\\, has a sliver of hope when it comes to Ellie and Dina. Perhaps explored in a DLC? I sure hope so. My only complaint is some parts of the story I felt were dragging. But it seems every time I started thinking \u2018man I\u2019ve been exploring without action for a while\u2019\\, I would get jumped or something crazy happened.\r\rThe action was insane\\, the gameplay was solid and the world we got to explore was simply breathtaking\r\rSpectacular game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
