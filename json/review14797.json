Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to agree with the critics on this one. A great movie\\, with many unsuspecting twists and turns. Unsure why so many fans disagree\\, but trust the people who know what they're talking about. This is a stellar example of a space opera.","true":true}
