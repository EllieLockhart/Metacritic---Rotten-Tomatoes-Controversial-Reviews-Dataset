Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll be in the minority here\\, 'cause many fans hated TLJ. I liked it way better than TFA. It had actual lessons to be learned from the story\\, and Ren\\, who I thought was lame in the first movie\\, more than made up for it here. Sure\\, this movie has some weak points\\, but I liked that they at least took chances here. ","true":true}
