Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie betrayed Luke's character by making him out to be a coward who ran and hide for 30s. Luke who never gave up on the good in his father almost murders his nephew in his sleep for showing dark tendencies which were never shown or explained. The movie dropped plots from the previous movie\\, portrays Rey as a God like figure who has no flaws and even though untrained is more powerful than any other character. Kylo rent has already been defeated by Rey in the first movie and is a poor supreme leader. The movie injected humor needlessly and undercut many potentially meaningful scenes. This is in my opinion the worst star wars movie ever.","true":true}
