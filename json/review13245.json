Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t understand the negative reviews. I was kept to the edge of my seat the whole film as I was dazzled with new and old characters\\, planets and villains. Like Empire\\, this film has the feel of a backlash against the idealism of A New Hope. A rebalancing of the force is at hand as the journey parallels the original trilogy without being a scene for scene rehash which was my only criticism of The Force Awakens. Long story short: as a lifetime Star Wars fan I always temper my expectations since the Jar-Jar Binks fiasco but this movie held up and sets the scene for an awesome conclusion to the trilogy.
