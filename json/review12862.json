Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like 7\\, but at least at the end of 7 they had built up enough new lore that I was interested to see the answers to the unknown characters and mysteries leading into 8.  7 built up the characters and mysteries only to have them fall flat in 8 with underwhelming answers that were lazy\/boring.  \\n\\nAlso\\, I know this film wasn't supposed to be about Luke\\, but people have been waiting decades to see Luke Skywalker be a bad ass on screen again and i feel they really wasted that opportunity.  There was a little action with him\\, but it was\\, again\\, underwhelming. That seems to be a key theme with this movie.  On top of that the movie is plagued with plot holes and some past star wars rules and lore are totally forgotten about in this film.  Unlike at the end of 7\\, I am not anxious to see 9.","true":true}
