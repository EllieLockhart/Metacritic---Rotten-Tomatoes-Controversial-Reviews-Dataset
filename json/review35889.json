Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the most ambiguous movie of all saga.There is a lot of \\\"strange\\\" moments in this film\\,but there is a lot of unexpected twists\\,which will blow your mind.Visual effects\\,actors are amazing.The story is the best of all Star Wars\\,but it is one of the best Star Wars movies on my opinion.\\nDmitriy Gerasymov(Ukraine)","true":true}
