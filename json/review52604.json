Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All drama aside from a story \/ writing perspective this movie is really bad\\, cheese scenes\\, continuity\\, lack of explanations etc.\\n\\nSpecial effects\\, music and all the other stuff is good but  if the story is bad it al falls down always.","true":true}
