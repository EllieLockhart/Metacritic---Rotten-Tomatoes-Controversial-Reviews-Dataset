Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a great addition to the trilogy. It is original with new and risky ideas. Some of those ideas payed off and some didn't. But I am grateful that risks were taken and we got to see things that star wars fans have never seen before","true":true}
