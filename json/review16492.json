Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm torn about saying this\\, but ultimately\\, I didn't like this film. There were too many failed\\, cheesy attempts at humor.  The plot is weak and uninspiring.  For those reasons alone\\, I don't like the film.\\n\\nHowever\\, I did find some hope in the interactions between the new characters.  Rey and Kylo Ren's scenes were compelling.  Finn and Rose's were as well.  Genuine feeling and interpersonal dynamics come out in those scenes.  That alone gives me hope for the future.  However\\, they need better storytellers.  The basis of the story\\, the Resistance fleeing the First Order is fine.  But the details are just silly.","true":true}
