Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic looking and technically first class.  Perplexing story telling.  There may be a master plan and it all tie together brilliantly in Episode 9.  What it appears to be at this point is the JJ and Johnson have worked independantly and Ep 8 leaves Ep 9 in a very strange starting place.  Growing up with the originals it is hard to take what has become of Luke.  That can happen I suppose\\, people can turn from genuine heroes to disillusioned cowards but don't expect that to generate a warm response.  Perhaps would be easier to accept if these \\\"old\\\" characters are replaced by three dimensional \\\"new\\\" ones\\, but they are most certainly not. Rey is impenetrably competent at everything without reason and from nowhere. Kylo is inexplicably bad and inconsistent.  Leaving act 2 feeling confused and dread with what to expect from act 3 rather than exhilarated and intrigued. Sad.","true":true}
