Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen kennedy at Disney prove they have complete disregard for the fans and 40 years of history.  I'll never spend a dime on anything Disney related again.  I gave it 1 star b\/c I heard a rumor that they don't count \\\"half star\\\" reviews in the rating.  Realistically\\, it should be a negative 40.","true":true}
