Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rubbish\\, boring stretched out\\, not a fitting second movie didn't develop the new trilogy at all\\, put A stall to it\\, Treatment of Luke was terrible!!! Not only put me off Star Wars put my kids off they really hated it that's saying something!!!","true":true}
