Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disgraceful insult to the Star Wars saga and to its fans.\\nI had high hopes after TFA but those hopes were dashed by this garbage.\\n\\nThought Ewoks and Jar-Jar were childish cash grabs?   They are NOTHING compared to damn PORGS!\\n\\nThis film is so incredibly stupid\\, it makes the Prequels look like works of GENIUS!\\nLeia flying through space was the single dumbest\\, bizarre and GROSS thing to EVER happen in a SW movie.\\nLuke squeezing giant alien TEETS and slurping up the juice comes a close 2nd. \\n\\nAnd don't get me started on Luke's 'astral projection' BS!
