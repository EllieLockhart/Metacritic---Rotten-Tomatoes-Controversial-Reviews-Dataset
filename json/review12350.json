Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am trying to express the shock felt after being exposed to this abomination and I can only say that I feel dirty after watching it. Embarrassed.\\nI recall an episode from \\\"The Simpsons\\\" when Homer Simpson was allowed to design a car and came up with a mechanical monstrosity. Amazingly\\, Mr. Rian Johnson made a similar nightmare came into reality but in a real life world ridiculous is not fun. Somehow he was given free reign over a cherished legacy and vandalized it for the sake of cheap immediate reward. \\n\\nIt was literally impossible to fail with Star Wars; it has a stone solid established lore\\, plenty of ideas from the EU\\, a loyal fan base from every age and a thriving discussion about the possible answers to the questions set by the previous movie; elements that made success almost inevitable.  Yet\\, the project was given to a TV director like Rian Johnson who clearly does not understand or love cinema and delivered a story that does not progress at large or does it slowly\\, lacks basic consistency\\, makes characters go into situations or places they never needed to go in the first place and completely ravages the heritage he was obliged to evolve\\, not to maim.\\n\\nThe movie evolves lethargically like a bad TV episode\\, so slowly that it gives you plenty of time to question the choices made by the characters and the story is so poorly written that it almost asks you to deduct a better course of action. \\nTo make it worse this happens so frequently that \\nit gets old quite fast. As I watched the movie suddenly began to ask myself why they did not try this or that instead. Later on I found out that everybody was asking similar questions: Why don't they try jumping into different directions at the same time?\\nWhy doesn't the dreadnought shoot the rebel ship first and the base later? Why the destroyers just sit around the entire movie and do nothing? Why they don't use the transport to evacuate the Rebels\\, one trip at a time\\, instead of going all the way to Casino Royal? How come they can the contact Maz but don't ask her to sent out a distress call to their allies?  \\nIf they can torpedo an enemy ship using hyperspace jump\\, why they did not try that before\\, like\\, with the medical frigate? How come the destroyers can't jump ahead of the Resistance cruiser? And so ad nauseam.\\nIt does not take long to realize that the average viewer has a better military mind than Holdo\\, Hux\\, Kylo and Leia\\, making the movie an event actually painful to watch and because those characters in charge made the most stupid choice one two many times the audience stops caring about them. The evil Order does not look intimidating\\nany more after watching how incompetent they are and the spirited Resistance does not look deserving of a better fate after all.  \\n\\nThe comic tone and buffoonish handling of well established characters is humiliating\\, to say the least. Johnson deliberately turned as many of them as he could into cartoons\\, archetypes that could have been just copied and pasted outright from a TV sitcom; any comparison of Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Kylo and Rose with Lisa\\, Bart\\, Milhouse\\, Nelson and Ralph is just about reciprocal. \\nThe depiction of males is essentially Freudian: Finn regressed to be a baby and even wakes up back to life in a giant diaper that \\\"pees\\\" water while he clumsily walks his first steps down the hall. Poe is another Oedipus that needs guidance after missing his mother and struggles to accept submission before Holdo\\, his oppressing new mother. Only until the end of the movie he understood the implied message that his mother Holdo knew better than him\\, but it is never questioned why she set him to fail so resolutely in the first place and the Admiral who actually triggered the demise of the Resistance went down with the ship\\, allegedly a hero. Jedi Master Luke himself cannot escape from being schooled by someone who about a week ago thought the Force was a legend and Finn must be indoctrinated by Rose\\, self-appointed voice of wisdom that every time she opens her mouth is to deliver a tirade about the merits of her superior morals.  \\nIn this brave new world every female has the duty to be an emasculating figure or she will not justify her own existence as a woman.\\nNaturally\\, to give assurance that males cannot overcome the oral stage they are shown engaging in jokes about their mothers and milking the breasts of a beast. Misandry is the new normal.\\nThe included political message is specially pervasive and hideous\\, appropriating ethical values like Good and Justice to bring them down as a commodity exclusive to their sect; Politics is the pinnacle of this product placement campaign.\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy honestly believe they are revolutionaries and accordingly make the same vindictive ideological excesses of those who have unchecked power. If a character does not fit into the vision of this cultural revolution it must not exist. Admiral Ackbar\\, Snoke and Luke must be purged because there is no room for them and are cinematically executed in front of the audience\\, a spectacle of horror to the viewer and seemingly of sadistic joy to the authors.\\n\\nI don't even want to spent more time trying to make sense of a plot that scrapped the logic\\, physics and psychology observed before. Bombs are \\\"dropped\\\" in zero gravity\\, humans survive in outer space\\, people can stand next to bomb bays or hatches wide opened to outer space\\, learning or training is irrelevant\\, freeing horses is important but slave children can be ignored\\, Masters go back and forth between commitment and repentance\\, the new supreme leader cannot remember that 10 minutes ago he destroyed the same light sabre that he is now seeing in the hand of his former teacher. Luke is a force ghost but the ghost dices are real to the touch.  Watching this storykiller is an exercise of embarrassment.\\n   \\nI am never so critical of a movie and usually enjoy cinema very much; I have no problem finding something redeemable even in bad films. In those cases you can tell\\, in part\\, that someone tried to put effort in them. You can see that someone cared but failed at some point along the process. In this case\\, they did not even try. Indeed\\, it is visually stunning\\, but visuals alone do not make a movie\\, just like good looks do not make a good person.\\nThis is not a movie\\, does not deserve to be called a film.","true":true}
