Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. I consider myself a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, having seen A New Hope in the theaters when I was 5 and having watched the original trilogy countless times since then. If watching the prequels was like getting pounded on the head with a blunt instrument\\, watching this one was the opposite. It was a breath of fresh air. The story was the most complex and the most unintuitive of the entire set. I loved that I truly didn't know what was going to happen\\, and that a few of the standard general plot patterns (e.g.\\, come up with a daring\\, crazy plan to which C-3P0 would give success odds of 10000 to 1\\, then succeed at it) were cast aside. It made the movie more exciting.\\n\\nI didn't care so much for the casino scene\\, and some of the humor felt a bit heavy\\, but these didn't put much of a dent in an awesome experience.\\n\\nFWIW\\, my son\\, who's been steeped in Star Wars since birth\\, loved it too and said it was his favorite.","true":true}
