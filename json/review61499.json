No\\, it doesn\u2019t go in the direction I expected (or hoped) but I think it\u2019s ludicrous to dismiss a story's quality because you don\u2019t like what happened to your fave character (online fandom is the WORST in this regard). I\u2019m sorry someone you wanted to have a happy ending died. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad story.As someone who loved the first one\\, I was stunned by Part 2 in the best ways.

It hinges\\, smartly\\, on the most controversial moment of the first game and how horrific acts for the \\\"right\\\" reasons still have consequences. The structure\\, also smartly\\, puts the revenge tale in the first half of the game\\, and then forces you to empathize with all the people you killed retroactively\\, knowing full well there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop what\u2019s coming. It forces you to examine of the actions of \\\"heroes\\\" critically which it seems some players just don't want to do.\r\rI think\\, ultimately\\, it probably belabored it\u2019s central point a bit too much\\, but I was gripped and tense the entire time. It is a fantastic achievement\\, IMO.\r\rGameplay is classic TLOU but polished\\, with dozens of tense encounters\\, a more fluid combat system and a surprising amount of action set pieces. Also was pleasantly surprised by the number of jump scares. Visually\\, I think this is certainly the best looking game of this generation\\, perhaps the best looking game ever made.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
