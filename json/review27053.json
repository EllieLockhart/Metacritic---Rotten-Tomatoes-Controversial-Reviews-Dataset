Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the biggest piles of hot garbage ever put to film. It was the equivalent of a 200 million dollar dumpster fire\\, I love so bad it's good movies which I would say TLJ definitely is\\, but I would be lying if I said I didn't understand why the hardcore Star Wars fans are upset and I feel bad for them. I mean I like garbage but mainstream audiences do not and The Star Wars fandom deserved more then this.","true":true}
