Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals with unexpected plot twists. I completely enjoyed this journey\\, and that while providing imagery similar to ESB early\\, it broke off the familiar themes\\, which made it more enjoyable.  I find the fan feedback amusing as the detractors said TFA was too much like A New Hope.  And The Last Jedi is too different than previous Star Wars movies.  The bottom line is some people are never happy\\, and trolling behind a faceless app on their phone is empowering.  Great Movie\\, that is can't miss!  Take it from the pro's who get paid to rate!","true":true}
