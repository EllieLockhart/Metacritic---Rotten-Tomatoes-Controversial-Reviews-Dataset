Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The next StarWars episode needs to start the crawl with an apology!!  Then the words \\\"EPISODE VIII (or IIX)\\\" Yup\\, write it off\\, pretend it never happened\\, say you're sorry Disney and try again!?","true":true}
