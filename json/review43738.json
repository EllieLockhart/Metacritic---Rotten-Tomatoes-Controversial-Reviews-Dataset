Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most poorly written and thought-out movie I have seen in a long time.  Disney succeeded in the biggest \\\"dropping the ball\\\" moment in movie-making history\\, congrats.  Terrible\\, illogical character arcs (if you even want to call them that)\\, hugely gaping plot holes that make no sense\\, very little story and character progression\\, and if it matters to you\\, a senseless re-write of the SW universe \\\"rules\\\" and characters...very irreverent to SW. I rank this the 12th worst Star Wars movie\\, behind the The Star Wars Holiday Special and The Ewoks Adventure.","true":true}
