Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the worst Star Wars movie out of the entire saga and it shifts away from the direction of the other films as a whole. May be a great movie for non Star Wars fans and children but other than there's not much to see. Like it's been said in other online media outlets\\, it has great visuals and a strong name but forced inclusions of characters and group representations and an incoherent and inconsistent plot with with either loopholes or unrelated continuity.","true":true}
