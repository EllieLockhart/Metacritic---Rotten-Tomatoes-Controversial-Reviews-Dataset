Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible film\\, it does not honor the saga that is Star Wars.. This film lacks true emotion and even though it is 2 1\/2 hours long it appears rushed and cheap. This film seems to have a forced agenda of adding characters whether it makes sense or not. It really is a mess of a film... It's almost a parody of Star Wars. Don't even get me started on the random insert of this Rose character who gets a ton of screen time even though she is not important in the slightest to the story. Plus it feels like she is in another movie entirely her tone and demeanor is so wrong its heartbreaking that this film is connected to Star Wars in anyway.","true":true}
