Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Top points:\\n\\nStaggeringly great cinematic visuals\\nProperly weighty score. \\n\\nNegative points:\\nNo character development. \\nA \\\"Fuck you\\\" to the source material and the fan base in EVERY measurable way.\\nSJW ideology shoved down everyone's throat.\\nStupid\\, chaotic men\\, calm and smart women...purple hair???\\nWomen patronzing and treating men exactly the way they bitch about being treated\\, but for no reason. \\nUseless subplots that go nowhere.\\nKielo is an emotional mess.\\nMary Sue is a savant that condones to translate Chewy to Luke.\\, tell Han about the Falcon and best TRAINED Jedi after hours\\,  not weeks\\, HOURS  of training. \\n\\nTotal sewage:\\nDisney homogeneity \\nStupid humor\\nRay was GIVEN every thing that Yoda needed centuries to attain\\, like magic.\\nSnoke everything from start to finish was raw sewage\\, including the stupid fight after his stupid death?\\nFin\\, the Asian engineer\\, the moron commander\\, gravity in space\\,  Leah Poppins\\, and the stupid cameos\\,  the animals being saved\\, white people are bad\\, the subliminal  male sexism from Poe - Poe? Are you having a laugh?\\nLaura Dern - stupid SJW character with no value to the plot. Leah has been a feminist icon for decades and Poe worships her.\\nThe rebel ships are supposed to be FASTER\\,  how did they not get away?\\nTotal double standards with the treatments of men comapred to women. \\n\\nA beautifully wrapped gift that when opened displays a steaming pile of excrement. \\n\\nDisney is tone deaf. Kathleen Kennedy is a blind deafmute.whose disdain for the male fans who created this franchise. The Force is Female? Good luck with that. You won't ever get another dime of my money.","true":true}
