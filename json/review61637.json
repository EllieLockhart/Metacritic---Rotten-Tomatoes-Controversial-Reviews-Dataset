No real gameplay to speak of\\, just quick time events layered over a mediocre story. Another gripe I have is that this game takes an absurdly short time to complete. About 22 hours. That just isn\u2019t worth it for me. $60 for 22 hours of cutscenes and a minuscule amount of game? And this isn\u2019t the type of game with replay value; you\u2019re only going through it once. That\u2019s pretty much how I felt finishing the game. I kind of want a refund.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
