Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just awful\\, plot holes everywhere. It really ruins the Star Wars brand with this garbage movie. I've never been so disappointed with a Star Wars movie ever\\, including a movie itself. This movie shoves so many political agenda down your throat. You do not want to see this movie\\, it's such a disgrace to a Star Wars brand. Rian Johnson should be fired for this\\, including Kathleen Kennedy!!!","true":true}
