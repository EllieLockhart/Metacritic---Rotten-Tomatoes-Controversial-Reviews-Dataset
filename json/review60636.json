Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"OMG I need more....\r\rWell done Naughty Dog!\r\rOverall:\rI have played many story driven games LOU1\\, metal gear games\\, Horizon\\, Gears of war\\, everything you can think of since gaming began (I'm getting on in age). This is one of\\, if not the best game I've played. It was so varied in the different locations and things that happen. The combat mechanics are just amazing\\, and just the right amount of improvements to the first game. Story is massively rewarding and has your emotions switching left and right\\,  and it left me wanting more once the game had ended. So much so I started again straight away which I've never done before. I can't sing its praises enough. Much better than the first Last of Us game.\r\rStory: The story is up there with even the best movies \/ tv shows. Can it win an oscar? Is it possible because it should. There is a shift of perspectives that will have your emotions and allegiances running wild not to mention the fear and pressure you feel of different situations you will encounter. The story is not predictable at all and keeps going even when you think its about to end.\r\rBad reviews:\rIgnore the massive raft of bad reviews from people who are completely butt hurt that Joel dies and you can't be him anymore.\r\rThey talk about ellie's bad decisions - she is driven by grief\\, anger and revenge so would not be making logical decisions but ones driven by pain. It's a compelling and rewarding story arc filled with redemption.\r\rAbbie is unlikeable - complete rubbish\\, your opinion will shift and she's a god damn bad ass. You will grow to love her and realise she was driven by the same grief and desire for revenge as ellie.\r\rBut Joel died - yes I was upset too\\, but his story had ended. He had a daughter again who he had saved. Stop being whiny and butt hurt!\r\rThe story is a mess - rubbish! I've never seen story telling like it. It's perfect. I'll admit\\, it can be a little slow in bits but the reward of the end of the game is perfect - just fantastic. A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\u2026 Expand","true":true}
