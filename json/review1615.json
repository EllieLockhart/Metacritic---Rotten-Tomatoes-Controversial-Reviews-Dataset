Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars Fan I hate everything\\, really absolutely everything in this Movie. What started promising with TFA has been crushed with TLJ. Thanks for nothing Disney and Mr. Johnson - please help us Mr. Abrams you are our only hope !!","true":true}
