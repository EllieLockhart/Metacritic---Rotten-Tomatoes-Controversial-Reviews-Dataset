Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I genuinely do not understand why so many fans are upset with this movie. I think that a lot of them were disappointed by the fact that things didn't go the way they wanted to go and then proceeded to miss the point of the movie. A lot of them think that Finn's story was pointless because his story arc resulted in failure\\, however the movie made a point to point out the fact that people learn from failures\\, and Finn's failure resulted in a complete character shift\\, so it wasn't pointless. \\nKylo\\, Luke and Rey's story arc was AMAZING and it was everything I could have wanted. People need to chill out. Rian Johnson did a great job with this movie and I can't wait for his trilogy.","true":true}
