What\\, did you want a repeat of the first game with Joel and Ellie? For the events of the first installment to have zero consequence? Go read a fanfic that panders to that then. The writers skillfully developed the characters through events you'd expect in an apocalypse\\, with tender moments of intimacy really being the highlight of the experience. The fact that music was such an integral part of the storytelling was beautiful - they really nailed these little moments that sit in a stark contrast to the heavy darkness of the overall theme. This game is so much more than it was marketed to be and goes far deeper than a tale of revenge and violence. You may not like the events of the game\\, but to deny that this is masterfully done feels ridiculous to me. It's rare that I say this but\\, LISTEN TO THE CRITICS! They're right to give this 5 stars. Outstandingly done and once again proving that video games are an amazing platform for storytelling.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
