Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had issues\\, it's true. The pacing was off in some places\\, and there were too many different plots to follow - scenes I had been looking forward to\\, like the casino and the Finn\/Phasma fight\\, seemed a little underwhelming. It's definitely not a perfect film.\\n\\nThat being said\\, I find that most of the criticism I've been seeing has been based off of personal speculation and fan theories not being recognized\\, which is rather unfair and biased IMO. A lot of the things people have been shrieking over actually...really aren't that big of a deal\\, to be honest. But in spite of having six movies to their name already\\, people just can't let go of the Skywalkers.","true":true}
