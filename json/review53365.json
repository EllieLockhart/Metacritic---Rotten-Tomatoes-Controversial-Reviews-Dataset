Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did anyone even read Rian Johnson's script before they approved this dumpster fire? There's almost no continuity between this film and the previous one. All of the mystery and subplots from VII were all but completely ignored and\/or failed miserably. Luke\\, among other characters were treated beyond disrespectfully\\, and every setup that JJ Abrams established in VII was blown up by Rian Johnson. So many things made zero sense. Plot holes beyond the reasonable expectation of a Star Wars movie. Too much humor as if it was a Marvel movie. Disappointing climax and one missed opportunity after another with the depiction of Luke. Rey has been utterly ruined\\, all mystery is gone. Her powers are completely unbelievable now\\, make no sense as to why she's so overpowered\\, and Snoke... I don't even want to talk to about it. My God this movie has destroyed my faith in Rian Johnson\\, and has me worried for the future of this story. JJ Abrams has a lot of work to do in order to fix the catastrophic mess Rian Johnson has created. It was basically an act of cinematic terrorism. I'm going to go cry and throw up now.","true":true}
