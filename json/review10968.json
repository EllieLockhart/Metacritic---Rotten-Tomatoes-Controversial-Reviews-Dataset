Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Have to say that this was by far the worst of the Star Wars movies... hell JarJar Binks was nothing compared to how Arian Johnson wrote The Last Jedi... the name does not even fit the movie... specially considering that Rey is obviously not the last Jedi\\, since hell Yoda can resurrect himself anytime he wants meaning that there will never be a Last Jedi. The Finn romance with Rose and the story in all was just shotty pushing pushing true Star Wars fans away like they had nothing to do with the rise and popularity of the Star Wars brand!","true":true}
