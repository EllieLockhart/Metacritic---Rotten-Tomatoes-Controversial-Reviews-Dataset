Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worse movies I've ever seen. Lots of bad\\, cringe-worthy jokes\\, terrible plots\\, terrible acting! Apparently\\, the makers don't like Star Wars. Why have them make the movie? I came up with several different versions of a potential sequel on my own since my first time seeing Star Wars in the 90s.","true":true}
