Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good: Great visuals and sound.  \\nBad: Horrible storytelling and editing with too many moments of cringe and bad humour.  It almost as if the concept of being the middle part of a trilogy was thrown out.  Too many universe-breaking elements and a Mary Sue character is confirmed\\, not explained. At the end\\, viewers are not left with the desire to find out how the trilogy will end. \\nUgly: It's suspicious that a real movie critic with any integrity could rate this movie as better than average.  The fact that Russian bots were blamed for the significant disparity between the critic and audience scores indicates that there is some manipulation of facts and reality.","true":true}
