Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is simply unlike anything we have seen before from a Star Wars film. The risk taken outweigh the parts of the film that were unnecessary. People complained about TFA playing it safe and being a rehashing of the previous installments\\, and now there is backlash for them taking things in a new direction.","true":true}
