Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going to get my year 3\/4 class to Watch the Return of the Jedi and rewrite it with new characters in....I think they will come up with something pretty close to The last Jedi (probably slightly better actually).","true":true}
