Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u00c9 um filme belo\\, mas raso. Historia arrastada e que poderia ter sido contada em 1:30h. Sou f\u00e3 da franquia e esse pra mim foi o pior filme de Star Wars at\u00e9 agora. Decepcionante o desfecho de personagens super importantes. Sem contar o fato de Kylo Ren ser um vil\u00e3o p\u00edfio! Parece mais personagem secund\u00e1rio. N\u00e3o \u00e9 emocionante e muito bobo na maior parte do tempo. Muita piada desnecessaria. Logo nos primeiros 5 minutos de filme tem 2 piadas... N\u00e3o sei pq a critica ta elogiando tanto esse filme.","true":false}
