Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is full of plot holes and illogical stuff\\, and as such is being used by Disney to re-franchise it so they could nake money without actually investing in quality story\\, that is believable.","true":true}
