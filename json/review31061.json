Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I just got home from \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" which is officially the 8th episode in the on going Star Wars saga that started back in 1977. (Ironically the year I was born!)\\n\\nThe first movie I remember my dad taking me to see was \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" when I was a kid but turns out I went with him and my mom to a few movies as a baby but just don't remember that clearly since I was a baby! DUH! \\n\\nBut I do remember Return of the Jedi... Some what\\, and I remember the wonder of it all like who's that giant slug\\, why is there a dude in carbonite\\, and what the hell is carbonite? How does one describe the special feeling it gave me to see the lazer sword light up for the first time as a kid without getting dirty? I mean it was that cool.\\n\\nThe Prequels I liked a lot\\, EP 1\\, and 2 didn't love but I was much older when I saw these\\, and while I Liked them I knew they were for the kids of that generation\\, and only for Revenge of the Sith which I felt George Lucas made for my generation so it was my favorite of the prequels....  But I never fully loved any one of those prequels like I did the original trilogy\\, and like I did \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" and later \\\"Rogue ONE.\\\" (Which makes New Hope even better to me!)\\n\\nNow we come to the newest Episode \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" directed by Looper director Rian Johnson who isn't the first person I'll admit I would think off when putting together a STAR WARS trilogy... JJ Abrams is no doubt the number one person on my list... Rian wouldn't have cracked my top 10... Now with that said it's not a knock on him or his work as Looper is a fine film I just aint seen enough of his work to hand him the keys to a STAR WARS Episode.\\n\\nBut not only did I walk out of the movie satisfied with what I saw but I was so happy with almost everything in the movie that I gotta say it's now up there with the best in the series \\\"Ep 5\\, 4\\, 7\\\" which are my favorite 3 in the saga. I'm not sure where to place it safter 1 viewing so I'll make my final decicion after a few more times as I want to see how it holds up.. The running time wasn't a factor for me as some said it was too long. I said it wasn't long enough! Now while we could do without some of the useless casino scenes it's always interesting to add those elements to anymovie.\\n\\nOverall I think this movie is a solid 5  Stars on R.T or IMDB 9.5 outta 10 for me... For now! Might go up or down as some time pass\\, and I watch it over\\, and over again. As most movies do once I see them more than once. Again Rian Johnson and his crew did a fine job here\\, and I cannot wait til Episode 9.... Yes I'm boycotting the Solo disaster.\\n\\nOh\\, and Rian Johnson should focus on the kid at the end who's force sensative for his Trilogy.... :D","true":true}
