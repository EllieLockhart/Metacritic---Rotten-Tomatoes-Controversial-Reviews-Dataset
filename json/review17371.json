Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I sat through TLJ on opening night with some friends and family\\, and our consensus at the end was \\\"we loved it\\\" it was like a wow moment. Now that I have had time to digest the movie\\, I am of the opinion that it was fresh\\, it went in new directions. Ryan took chances with the script and they paid off. He refused to make a \\\"you must follow the fans expectation\\\" movie. instead RJ delivered a truly remarkable film (yes there were still little issues\\, but none that override the movie as a whole).  The main issue that others seem to  have with the movie\\, is the portrayal of Luke\\, he is not what they were expecting\\, and as such their whole disdain for the movie is based on this one element\\, so unfortunately a lot of reviews are severely fan biased (you know the people \\\"I'm a true star wars fan so therefore I'm right\\\" or \\\"Why didn't they make my star wars\\\".\\n\\nIn time this episode will I believe become a Star Wars classic\\, and that's due to taking the hard core star wars fan out of their safe little comfort zone and going in new directions. It allows for the franchise to grow and to continue to go in new directions\\, which as a fan is what we need.  So I say watch the movie\\, do not have preconceived ideas\\, and you will love the movie too.\\n\\n\\nMay the Force Be With You","true":true}
