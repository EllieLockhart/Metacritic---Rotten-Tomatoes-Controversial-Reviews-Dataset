Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It definitely kills the past... and present and future for that matter. Also\\, the only reason I'm giving this movie 1 star is because I know that giving a movie anything less is ignored on this site and not counted in the average rating.","true":true}
