{"101487":179639,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst film in the franchise.  One star for cinematography only (which was excellent).  At least Phantom Menace had Darth Maul and introduced a new generation to the Star Wars franchise.  This movie just destroys it\\, completely betrays the true lifelong fan who's been there since the beginning.  \\n\\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\\nThe Last Jedi had a ton of ridiculous plot holes:\\n\\n1.  Like why not just jump some of the New Order fleet in front of the resistance and box them in.\\n\\n2.  And seriously\\, not a single character would have considered\\, \\\"Hey\\, we're attacking the New Order's Star Killer base\\, maybe we should gas up the starships in case we have to run\\\"?\\n\\n3.  Also\\, while the shuttles are escaping\\, why not position the frigates between the new order and the defenseless shuttles?  And why does the Resistance have about 20 completely defenseless ships? \\n\\n4.  So let me get this straight\\, the Last Jedi is an immediate continuation of The Force Awakens and Rey has only had recognizable force powers for about a day or two\\, maybe a week at the most.  Explain to me how\\, with just a few hours of Luke's half-assed training\\, she can take on the Praetorian Guard?  3 highly trained soldiers\\, Snokes personal guard\\, on 1 poorly trained scrapper?  Really?\\n\\n5.  Of course\\, we know Leia has some force sensitivity but obviously no formal training\\, but she can somehow survive in a vacuum and rescue herself from a deep space hull breach...what\\, instinctively?  \\n\\nand I could go on...\\n\\nSeriously\\, the movie was the longest in the franchise and the director claims there was no time for adequate character development.  There were so many missed opportunities for great characters:\\n\\n1.  Snoke - who we pretty much discovered nothing about.\\n\\n2.  Rey's parents - who we pretty much know nothing about.\\n\\n3.  Captain Phasma - who we pretty much know nothing about.\\n\\n4.  The Praetorian Guard - who we pretty much know nothing about.\\n\\n5.  The Knights of Ren - who we know pretty much nothing about.\\n\\n6.  Vice Admiral Holdo - who we pretty much know nothing about.\\n\\n\\nThe whole Canto Bight subplot\\, in retrospect was pretty much worthless.  It was pointless and ridiculous\\, a terrible cartoony distraction from the main story.  Plus\\, this little side-venture in the story makes Finn's character look thoughtless and impulsive\\, his actions resulting in the deaths of most of the Resistance single-handedly\\, a terrible tragedy never even addressed in the movie.  Kind of like an \\\"Oh-well\\, Finn got all these people killed.  Guess he's still a hero\\, though.\\\"  Lame.\\n\\n\\nThe Yoda cameo was just weak.  It could have been so much more.  That's all.\\n\\n\\nAnd\\, it needs to be said\\, what was with the Ahch To boob scene?  Was it really necessary to the story?  Just dumb and immature.  Because\\, sure\\, alien animals should really have human-looking breasts\\, but they need four of them\\, and the audience should really see Luke Skywalker give one a good squeeze...especially the younger kids (facetious).  Smh.  Shame on you Disney.  Not your princess's movie\\, I guess.\\n\\n\\nFinally\\, and this is the one unforgivable thing about this movie from a die-hard Star Wars fan - the complete and utter waste and humiliating destruction of the character Luke Skywalker.  Originally portrayed as an unlikely hero\\, the powerful champion of the Rebellion in the original trilogy\\, he was rewritten in the film as a whiny\\, defeatist douchbag\\, who ultimately dies alone\\, never in any danger at all in the end\\, nor even actually facing his enemy directly.  A pathetic\\, cowering end to the same character who defeated and redeemed Darth Vader\\, then resisted the Emperor's wrath in Return of the Jedi.  Regrettably\\, Instead of dying by the lightsaber\\, Luke Skywalker's end is relegated  to a nearly emotionless whimper.  It's a shame I can't unwatch this film and hold onto Luke as a triumphant and powerful Jedi with a hopeful future.  Instead\\, I'm now left with Luke's miserable pointless life\\, cowering and broken\\, too afraid to confront his own demons  and never reclaiming the mantle of hero.\\n\\n\\nAltogether\\, a truly disappointing movie.  Correct that\\, just terrible.  Really\\, really bad.  As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I think this addition to Disney's \\\"canon\\\" is pretty much the last one I can watch.  The legends timeline\\, now completely invalidated\\, had far more potential\\, a much truer vision to George Lucas's original creation.  Anyways\\, I'm done.","true":true}
