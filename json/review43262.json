Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was absolutely the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, I have been a fan for 40 years now and this movie seems to want to destroy everything we loved. TBH this movie made the Force Awakens kinda irrelevant\\, all the hype and build up in that movie was literally thrown over the shoulder and characters we thought would be central became completely worrhless. Lots of attempts at some cheap laughs a little SJW theme and some real bad subplots made this movie terrible. Not sure how this franchise will redeem itself with half it's audience alienated bravo Rian Johnson bravo.","true":true}
