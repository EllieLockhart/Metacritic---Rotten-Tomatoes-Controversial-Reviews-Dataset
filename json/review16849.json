Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Intentionally stayed away from all reviews and leaks\\, I wanted to come in as blind to the film as could be possible. I ended up loving it. It wasn't just a great SW film but a great film itself. Some seem to be upset that there wasn't just two and a half hours of fan service and catering to the millions of fan theories that were baked up after The Force Awakens.","true":true}
