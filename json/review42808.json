Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, was not good. At all. \\n1. Way to many jokes. Dont get me wrong I like a chuckle once in a awhile but the beginning of the movie where Poe and Hux have that exchange was not needed.\\n2. That was not Luke Skywalker. He wouldnt try to kill his own nephew (or even have the thought)\\n3. Finn should of died. Someone big needed to die in this movie besides Skywalker...And I liked Finn until he was saved by Rose.\\n4. Rose's characters if just fucking dumb.\\n5. The Casino planet was fucking not needed. Why not just get Maz to send fucking help.\\n6. Floating Leia..........\\n7. Better ending for Admiral Ackbar. (I wish he would of sacrificed himself instead of the purple haired bitch)\\n8.Snoke............\\n9. Kylo Ren just isnt a good villain. \\n10. Where the fuck is the Knights of Ren?\\nOverall: This was a splash movie. There was splash moments where the movie was actually cool. (Puppet Yoda and Luke\\, Rey and Luke\\, The Praetorian guard fight.) But those moments couldnt save the film. Shit I even made a better backstory to this movie than Disney...they really got this franchise all fucked up.","true":true}
