Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When a director wants to subvert expectations\\, it's easy to execute it poorly.  That is the case here.  We can Look at the horrible treatment  of Luke\\, the dead ends to every story arc from the force awakens\\, The garbage new characters\\, Lack of character development\\, or the attempt at Humor\\, the film fails on so many levels.    The visuals  do not save it.","true":true}
