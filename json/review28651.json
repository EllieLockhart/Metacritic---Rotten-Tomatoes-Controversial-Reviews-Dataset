Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros:\\nVisually stunning\\, a few good fight scenes.\\n\\nCons: Jokes are forced\\, bad dialogue\\, plot holes everywhere\\, jarring editing\\, unsatisfying character development\\, entire plot is just a slow chase scene\\n\\nOverall with the plot\\, character development\\, dialogue leaving such a bad taste in your mouth it's hard to appreciate any merits of the movies which are few.","true":true}
