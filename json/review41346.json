Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a major disappointment. It seems to have avoided the tacky fan service of TFA by desecrating the Star Wars legacy altogether. Progressive political messaging is nauseatingly obvious in the film and there are many scenes in which dialogue\\, humour or events are so odd disjointed from the Star Wars universe that it becomes entirely bizarre.\\n\\nYou were told this film took bold risks and ventured into dangerous new territory\\, that's true. What you weren't told is that the result is a dismal fail.","true":true}
