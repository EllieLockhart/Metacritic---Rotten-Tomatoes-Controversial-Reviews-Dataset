Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider myself an average movie goer who also happened to grow up with star wars.  I held off seeing this star wars because of all the fan reactions.  I finally decided to see it for myself thinking it's star wars\\, it can't be that bad.  unfortunately it was far far worse than I could have ever imagined.  without spoilers\\, all I can say I am still reeling from what happened.  on top of that I am now being told star wars doesn't need male fans.  I don't even understand where that is coming from because my issues with the movie didn't even have problems with women on my list.  it reeks of condescending disdain for my feelings as a fan.  my advice\\, skip this movie if your a fan.","true":true}
