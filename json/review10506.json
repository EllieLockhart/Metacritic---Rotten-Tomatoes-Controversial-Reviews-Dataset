Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great star wars movie and great movie all around. introduces new ideas and concepts but nothing beyond the realm of a space fantasy movie. Some of the best acting in a star wars movie we have ever seen. This movie breaks many trilogy rules but i believe that sets it up for an even more epic episode 9 than anybody could have imagined.","true":true}
