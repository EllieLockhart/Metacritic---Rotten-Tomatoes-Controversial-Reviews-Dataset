Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An entertaining sequel with horrible pacing\\, structure and weird decisions that may or may not pay-off in the next installment. Filled with enjoyable characters\\, but  only 2 of them have real development. Kylo Ren remains the most interesting thing out of this new trilogy.","true":true}
