Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlearn what you have learned. Star Wars fans are a fickle bunch\\, and this movie will be highly divisive because it takes much of what the franchise is built on and totally deconstructs it. People who complained that The Force Awakens didn't take enough risks will undoubtedly criticize this movie for taking too many risks. It feels fresh and new in a way Star Wars hasn't felt since Episode V. If this franchise is going to grow and last then it needs to be shaken up\\, and Rian Johnson has done exactly that. There are so many twists and turns\\, unclear motivations and unreliable narrators\\, all of which serve the larger creative point of this film: this isn't your father's Star Wars anymore. And that's a good thing. If you didn't enjoy this movie then I really feel sorry for you\\, because it was the unexpected and creative jolt this franchise sorely needed.","true":true}
