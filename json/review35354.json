Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The issue is that the movie relies heavily on the past characters and rememerable phrases while trying to build new characters with no substance or value that seems authentic. Critics used to criticize the horrible injection of the ewoks and state it hurt the movie making it the lesser of the three. Now you have many main and supporting characters that have very weak content that pose the question why to even bring back in the next movie. I was weary when Disney bought the franchise due to the main intent of just another avenue of generating money. This movie with its poor taste in jokes and quotes dropping suffers from what Lucas envisioned when even releasing the prequels\\, that is the enduring saga of the balance in the force set to really good background scenes. It was a movie like the first one to where it's worth seeing once then never have the urge to seeing it again like Spiderman 3\\, Indy 4\\, X-Men Apocalypse\\, and Matrix 2 & 3\\, all forgettable movies that were based good orginal movies that squandered the opportunity of a great story telling potential.
