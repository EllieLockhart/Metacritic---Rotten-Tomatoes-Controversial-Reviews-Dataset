Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are two major flaws with this film that let down all of the great cg work. 1. Numerous glaring plot holes throughout the film. 2. Foreshadowing in this movie was taken out back and shot. Every piece of foreshadowing laid out prior and within the film is completely ripped out and thrown away. Watching this film is like watching someone's arrogant attempt at subverting everything that makes good story telling. This film for me was unsatisfying from one jarring moment to the next. Disney really need to get their act together.. George Lucas must be livid that this hack job was allowed through to tarnish his epic. What a waste of Cathy fisher's last ever acting role\\, the film's disrespect for her role would be comedic if it wasn't excruciatingly painful to watch.","true":true}
