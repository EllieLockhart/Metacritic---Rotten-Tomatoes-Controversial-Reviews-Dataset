Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will definitly be the most polarizing Star Wars movie ever created until now. Why? I think the casual Star Wars Fan will like or even may love this movie\\, whilst hardcore fans (like I am; having read 250+comics\\, books etc being fully in touch with old canon from the hyper space wars to new republic) won't be satisfied with how this movie ties up the loose ends from the old trilogy and TFA aswell what it does to legendary characters like Luke Skywalker\\, Princess Leia and so on.\\n\\nFirst of all: it was not a terrible movie\\, it was not even a terrible star wars movie as other reviewers will want to tell you\\, it's just that the payoff to some character arcs was greatly disappointing. tension was great\\, i always feared for the lifes of characters on screen\\, visuals where great\\, besides the rose and finn plot\\, pacing was also great  and plotholewise it wasn't too bad. humor has been done good\\, but i had the impression it was overdone sometimes: example: SPOILER:\\nluke \\\"meets\\\" leia one last time and kisses her on her forehead\\, which could have been an increadibly emotional and strong scene\\, but instead of keeping the the mood\\, luke is cracking a \\\"you changed hair\\\"-joke. same shit TFA did when han saw leia for the  first time after long years and c3po jumped infront of the scene for some slapstick humor. but i guess that is what happens when disney takes over and panders to younger audience.\\n\\nrey\\, poe and kylo all have great character development\\, almost all new characters in FTA and TLJ are likeable and intresting (besides captain phasma\\, who gets the \\\"boba fett-treatment\\\") and it really feels like the new trilogy tries to push the new generation of heroes to replace the old\\, which is understandable\\, but it's a horrible disservice to those of us who admire the old heroes and would just prefer seeing more of them\\, instead of new newbies.\\n\\nthe last thing i wanna talk about is how the movie handels with Luke Skywalker\\, the legendary Hero who saved the galaxy and is the driving force of the plot from TFA: he dies the Obi-Wan-Death\\, without any good reason\\, having to sacrafice himself and what is the very worst of it all: WITHOUT ANY LAST EPIC MOMENT OR BATTLE. seriously he is entirely out of danger and just \\\"becomes one with the force\\\"\\, for no good reason at all\\, but \\\"force ghost duuh\\\" we do not event get to see his green lightsaber in action? WTF i mean i understand that he is supposed to be all grumpy and dickish\\, but if the original trilogy has tought me anything\\, it is that luke skywalker in the end will do whatever he can to fight and resist evil\\, when he sees it but here he just seems to give up to be an advisor in episode IX instead of an active fighter for the light...\\n\\n\\n\\nThis movie wasn't bad and i really did enjoy the middle part and tension and twists\\, but as a great fan of the old canon i could have imagined a thousand ways to make it better and more satisfying for hardcore fans like me. \\nwhen i came out of the theater\\, i just had a baaaad feeling about this...","true":true}
