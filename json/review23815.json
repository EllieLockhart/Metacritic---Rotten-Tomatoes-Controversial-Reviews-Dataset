Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was ruined. Yoda ruined. Forced comedy\\, forced story\\, no tension\\, no excitement. I was bored in the movie theater. WTF was I watching? Snokes is a nobody\\, Rey is a nobody\\, stupid animated animals everywhere. Here\u2019s the story. The empire chases the rebels at 5mph and waits for them to run out of gas. Yoda\u2019s force ghost calls forth lightning from the clouds\\, Lea uses the force to fly in space and Luke dies from being tired. The end... of Star Wars.","true":true}
