Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing.  It seems as though Rian Johnson and company have lost or never had a basic understanding of the grand story of Star Wars\\, the history of the Star Wars universe\\, or even the ability to make a plot believable. \\n\\nWhat is the moral of the story? Well\\, we learned that war profiteering is evil. We learned that random animals shouldn't be caged for entertainment. And we learned that the structure and composition of the first order and resistance are based solely on the whims of this useless story. \\n\\nThe problem with this movie is that it was created in a universe that already exists.  If we knew nothing about this universe or even the history of this universe\\, we could excuse many of its problems. But we can't.  We know too much to allow this garbage to pass as an acceptable installment. From the all the conflicts between the early Jedi and Sith\\, the different wars between factions of the galaxy\\, to the development of specific characters\\, The Last Jedi ignores everything that is great about the Star Wars universe. \\n\\nI've loved Star Wars since I was 4. I'm convinced that any true Star Wars fan could make a better movie.  Without getting into spoilers\\, there are plenty of alternate events that could have made an infinitely better story than this. \\nI guess the good thing is that The Phantom Menace is no longer the worst in the saga.","true":true}
