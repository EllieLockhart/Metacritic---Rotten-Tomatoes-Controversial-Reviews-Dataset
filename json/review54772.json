Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it didn't scare me enough then..\\n\\nStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi\\n\\nWhen Luke Skywalker says\\, \\\"..Han was Han about it..\\\"\\, Rey smirks slightly for just a frame on the screen this shows that not only is the movie written explicitly on paper but also executed with all the dedication and excellence. The Last Jedi checks off each and every fantasy of a fan\\, whether it be complex concept\\, dreadful characters\\, awe-struck moments or one of the finest unpredictability natured script of Star Wars. The sense of urgency that was present in The Force Awakens is still kept alive with a tightly packed screenplay especially in the last hour of the movie (which is the ace in the hole and also reminds you of Inception) where the movie holds you on the edge of the seat proving you wrong about every prediction you might have created in your mind (Literally Luke Skywalker's dialogue comes alive\\, \\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\"). A marvelous background music by John Williams\\, stunning visuals and Adam Driver's presence on the screen are some of the bright colors that paints this stunning craft that Star Wars is. This is Rian Johnson\\, Star Wars and a cinema at its peak\\, without any doubt this is the best installment of Star Wars Series till date.","true":true}
