Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers here\\, spoilers aren't necessary.  \\n\\nI've been a huge fan of the Star Wars saga since I saw Ep. IV in the theater when I was 6.  This saga has certainly seen worse movies\\, but not by far.\\n\\nThe major faults in this movie lie in the differences in direction between 7 & 8.  7 maintained a couple indispensible plot threads moving in a smooth linear fashion\\, with a clear emotional tone in each scene.\\n\\n8 on the other hand\\, has a plot line which is entirely dispensable (and should have been disposed of\\, to spend more time on the threads that needed it).  It is loaded with quick scenes that cut back-and forth too often\\, which destroys the rhythm\\, compared to 7.  Also\\, within a given scene\\, the tonal shifts are far too abrupt.\\n\\nLastly\\, it tries too hard to be funny.  I get that humor is a required element\\, but it's as though there were too many notes that asked for the script to be more Joss Whedon-y.  Star Wars is not The Avengers.","true":true}
