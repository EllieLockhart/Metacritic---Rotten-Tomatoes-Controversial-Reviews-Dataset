Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi really and truly broke my heart.  I cannot believe the script that written for Luke.  How did this get approved? \\n\\nI've read a lot of reviews compare it to Marvel or Guardians of the Galaxy.  I wouldn't know about that as I don't watch those.  But I do know Star Wars and this movie doesn't deserve to call itself part of that saga.  If I wanted to watch those other movies\\, I'd buy a ticket for them.  I wanted to see Star Wars\\, but that is not what I got.","true":true}
