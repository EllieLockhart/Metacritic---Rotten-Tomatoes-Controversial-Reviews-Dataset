Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First I was truly disappointed by Episode VII. Then Rian Johnson was announced to direct Episode VIII and I loved Looper. Rogue One was a great SW movie which captured the essence of this universe. In this context\\, I was confident in Disney solving all the Episode VII problems and making something creative and innovative in the SW universe.\\n\\nAnd the result for me is ...\\n\\nWorst Star Wars movie ever made. Even worse than The Force Awakens which had at least tried to make some things look epic.\\n\\nPlot holes\\, too much Marvel-like comedy\\, \\\"shut up it's magic\\\" moments\\, bad character developments (some good ideas but not fully developped)\\, awkward scenes\\, just listenable music... And a lot more things that would need me to spoil lots of part of the movie...\\n\\nDisney finaly ruined it for me. Not going to watch the Solo movie... Even Disney doesn't have faith in it\\, and now tries to put the responsability on the main actor and the directors change... \\n\\nDisney\\, you bought Lucasfilm but never understood what Star Wars is... It's a real shame \\\"hardcore fans\\\" cried over the prequels so that Lucas stopped to work on SW after it... \\n\\nSo that Disney can do this...\\n\\nWould have loved to see Lucas's vision on a new trilogy !","true":true}
