Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid Star Wars fan \\, I strongly dislike this film . The Last Jedi shuts down narrative threads that were introduced in The Force Awakens in an attempt to \\\"subvert our expectations.\\\" However \\, what it should've done is further establish said narrative threads instead of totally deviating from it. It would've resulted in a much more compelling plot and in turn \\, a better movie.","true":true}
