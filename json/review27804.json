Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps the worst film ever created by Hollywood.  Rian Johnson and Disney Studios accomplished what they intended........effectively destroying the Star Wars franchise.  It is the typical \\\"Twister Genre\\\" film....one with so many special effects that they do not include a plot.  Rian Johnson should be ashamed of itself and the critics who praise this POS either were paid off by Disney to write the good reviews (I wonder if Disney can deduct that as cost of sales on its tax return) or are mentally retarded.  Either way\\, I am now boycotting all Disney products and entertainment (save ESPN).","true":true}
