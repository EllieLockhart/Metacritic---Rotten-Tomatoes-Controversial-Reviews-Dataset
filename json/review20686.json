Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched this movie 4 times just to be sure...This movie  was so bad that it makes me cherish jar jar binks. I thought that the phantom menace was the worst movie in the franchise but this takes the cake. I have no idea whats going on anymore. Leah can just fly around and Luke is a douche. Cya snoke before we know what your character is. I think this may of ruined the franchise for me. The last movie was ok but this one is a mess. I thought rogue one was awesome\\, but this may be my last star wars movie. I upped to a full star however because visually this is probably the best out of all of them. ","true":true}
