The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of Us Part 2 was an emotional game for me\\, that took me on one hell of a journey full of tragic events\\, and moments that made me feel a little reluctant and uneasy. The fact that the game is so divisive makes the game much more unique and better in my opinion. Naughty Dog took some really bold decisions when it came to the story\\, and I for one enjoyed those decisions\\, and never did I think that I would play a game so personal\\, or would end up loving a character that I despised at the start of a game. The character development of Abby was one of the best things about the game\\, and this is where the game either makes or breaks for people playing it. If you are able to understand the character of Abby\\, then you are going to love the game and the choices it makes. But if you keep the death of Joel in your head\\, and refuse to let go the idea of revenge\\, then you are not going to enjoy this game. I think that the quote \u2018There are no heroes in the world of Last of Us\u2019 perfectly describes this game for me. It\u2019s all about perspective\\, and the way you interpret the story is what makes all the difference. Yes Joel was a beloved character\\, and yes his death was painful\\, but the game needed his death\\, and I don\u2019t think\\, Naughty Dog could\u2019ve come up with a better story to justify the sequel. The Last of Us Part 2 is different from its predecessor\\, and is much more divisive and makes a lot of questionable and bold decisions\\, and these decisions are what make the game so appealing and unique to me. The same reason might lead you to hate the game\\, and that is completely fine. Art is meant to evoke feelings out of you\\, and just like every other good piece of art\\, it is polarizing. This is what makes The Last of Us Part 2 a masterpiece in my eyes. Naughty Dog have really outdone themselves and created a game that is so powerful and emotional that the story will stay with you long after the credits roll. The Ps4 has seen many great games during its life cycle\\, but I think that The Last of Us Part 2 will be forever remembered as a Masterpiece that did not shy away from doing things differently.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
