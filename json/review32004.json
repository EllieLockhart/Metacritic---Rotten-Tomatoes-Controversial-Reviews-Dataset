{"101487":169442,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers* I saw the film on Thursday\\, December 14 with two of my closest friends\\, who I had converted into Star Wars fans over the years. We were very excited to see it. It was definitely different. As a huge Star Wars fan\\, I was a little disappointed with the fact that it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie\\, unlike all of the others. They wasted Snoke's character\\, who was supposed to be this mysterious\\, ominous Force-user. They also wasted Luke\\, just so they could demonstrate his power and kill him off. He was supposed to serve some great purpose in Episode IX rather than Force ghost. Also\\, Laura Dern's character was very unlikeable. They also added this new character\\, Rose\\, who had no relevance to the plot. She was unlikeable\\, and her character was very underdeveloped. The only reason she was there was to be some sort of love interest for Finn\\, even though Finn and Rey would undoubtedly be the greatest Star Wars ship since Leia and Han. They have so much chemistry\\, and there is nothing between Finn and Rose. There was also little to no interaction between 3PO and R2\\, a classic movie relationship\\, which they could've done even without Kenny Baker. They also wasted Phasma's character\\, who was probably in it for roughly a minute. There was also a very strange scene with Leia using the Force. She floats in space then she pulls herself into a spaceship\\, where they should have just killed her off there. They didn't even kill Leia off in this movie\\, so how are they going to pull off Episode IX? Mention her death? CGI Leia death? There was also a problem with the uneven storyline\\, familiar themes (like Luke refusing at first to train Rey until she demonstrates how strong with the Force she is). It also attempted to be comedic but failed. The only slight comic relief was the interactions between Chewie and the Porgs. But that's another thing. There was hardly any Chewbacca in it! And the Porgs\\, as cute as they were\\, are just another piece of merchandise you'll see at Target and the Disney store\\, and you'll see little kids wearing Porg backpacks with Porg plushies. Also\\, Luke's entrance during the climax when he reunites with Leia was supposed to be touching\\, emotional\\, and powerful. But it felt weak\\, tired\\, and EXTREMELY anti-climactic. Overall\\, the movie did not advance the story in any way. It ended sort of like Empire but without hope. One pleasant surprise was the inclusion of Yoda's Force ghost in one scene\\, where Yoda acts as Obi-Wan's Force ghost in Empire and Luke acts as Yoda in Empire. And I don't know about Episode IX's First Order after Snoke's death. There should have been some confrontation between Rey and Snoke\\, like Luke and Vader in Empire. Instead\\, Kylo Ren kills Snoke and asks Rey to join him. Then they have this fight that results in the destruction of Anakin's\/Luke's\/Rey's lightsaber. Instead of having Kylo Ren lose his mask in a clever way\\, they just had him destroy it in anger\\, just so he could a new mask in Episode IX\\, so they can sell more MERCH. Anyway\\, this movie has created the most complicated opinion I've ever had on a movie. EVER. When I got out of it\\, my first reaction was positive. But I was still sort of confused. I tried processing all of the decisions that I didn't agree with. It did a lot of things really well\\, but a lot more it went the totally wrong way. It was just sort of disappointing. As a fan\\, I still don't know how I feel. At least the Force Awakens FELT like a Star Wars movie. It just had that feel. The Last Jedi did not. It was sort of a mess. And the ending scene shifted the tone so much that it felt more like a post-credits scene\\, to be honest. Now\\, that's my review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. If you want to read about what I would have done different if I had been in Rian Johnson's shoes (screenwriter and director)\\, then please read below....\\n\\nFirst of all\\, I would have had the opening scene be the First Order finds the Resistance base\\, and leads an attack as Leia and Laura Dern's character evacuate Resistance fighters on cruisers guarded by X-wings. This would have served for a more proper introduction of Laura Dern's character. I would've shown the destruction of the Resistance base\\, then onto the First Order ship where General Hux is leading the attack. I would've shown his fail as the evac cruisers get away. I would have had Snoke's hologram confront Hux and his fail like in the movie. Then it would show Kylo Ren in a chamber practicing the Force\\, with his mask on. He would try to connect with Rey and fail. We would see Leia unconscious after previously showing the hit on one of the cruisers. Then I would establish Laura Dern's position of leadership in the Resistance. Then I would transition to Ahch-To\\, right where the Force Awakens left us hanging with Rey handing Luke the lightsaber. I would have done something similar in the Last Jedi\\, like having Luke throw it behind him and walk away. But why was he standing on the cliff anyway? He immediately went to milking those new aliens (MERCH) right after. Was he waiting for Rey so he could throw the lightsaber and add that minor comedic element? Anyway\\, then Luke would hide in his little hut. It would cut to night with Chewie roasting a Porg scene (if the inclusion of porgs was even necessary\\, but we have to have Chewie)\\, and the living Porgs staring at him with sad puppy eyes. I would've had R2 next to Chewie\\, and have some comedic interaction with the Porgs. I would cut to Rey\\, sitting by the water\\, then cut to the Resistance in hyperspace. Finn would reunite with poe and BB-8\\, then the ship would exit hyperspace and the First Order ship will appear\\, having tracked them through lightspeed\\, with the aid of Laura Dern's character who is a traitor. We figure this out once Laura Dern's character decides to do nothing. Poe will kill her and then Poe would take command\\, becoming leader of the Resistance during Leia's unconsciousness. Poe would tell Finn to go on an escape pod to go get help. I would leave out the unnecessary inclusion of Rose\\, and have Finn go on this mission alone with BB-8. Cut to morning on Ahch-To\\, where Rey is doing that crazy lightsaber stuff around that weirdly-shaped rock. She will balance the force around the rock and then split it in half with her lightsaber\\, and the one half of the rock will fall into the ocean. We see that Luke has been observing her. He decides that he should train her. We cut to R2 and Chewie playing a game of Dejarik\\, just like in A New Hope. Then they would hear an obnoxious banging sound and find that the natives of the island are stripping apart the Millennium Falcon. Chewie would scare them off with his roar as R2 zaps them with his lightning. Then cut to the top of the island where Luke trains Rey to balance the Force and learn about the interaction between the Force and all living things. Rey would see the dark side\\, then Luke would give up and go away. The sky will get cloudy and more ominous and it will be foggy. Rey stumbles upon the tree with the old Jedi texts\\, where she finds them. I will foreshadow Yoda's appearance by placing his silhouette in a quick shot of the tree. Luke will find Rey looking at the texts\\, and he will say his line from the trailer \\\"It's time for the Jedi to end\\\" Rey eventually convinces Luke that she and the Resistance (and Leia) need his help. He refuses\\, so Rey goes to the Falcon\\, where she finds Chewie and R2 finishing up repairing the Millennium Falcon. Then\\, she has the vision from the Force Awakens of the Jedi temple burning down and Luke's hand on R2's. Then we cut to Kylo Ren\\, who is trying to reach Rey through the Force. Rey responds. They talk. Cut to Luke\\, who senses the disturbance in the Force and finds Rey communicating with Kylo\\, after he has told her about the training and Luke wanting to murder him. Luke and Rey fight\\, then Luke explains that he saw darkness in Kylo Ren. Rey tells him that her friends are in danger\\, and she decides to leave. Cut to Takodana\\, where Maz Kanata lives\\, and Finn will be searching for Maz Kanata. He finds her\\, and she says she cannot help\\, but she knows someone who can help break into the First Order ship and shut down the lightspeed tracking technology. Cut to Resistance\\, TIE fighters are in pursuit as X-wings race around. Poe and Admiral Ackbar and other leaders decide that they are doomed\\, but Poe tells them about Finn and that they still have hope. Cut to unconscious Leia\\, close-up on her face\\, then her hand. Her fingers move and then a crate moves across the floor. Cut to the Millennium Falcon in hyperspace travel. Chewie and R2 are continuing their game of Dejarik\\, as a few Porg stowaways waddle around on the ship\\, one on Chewie's shoulder. Then Rey is connecting with Kylo Ren again\\, trying to resist. He asks her to trust him and she does. The Falcon exits hyperspeed and approaches the First Order ship. Once the Falcon is docked inside the ship\\, Rey has Chewie and R2 hide in the smuggling compartments\\, and Rey exits. The Falcon is surrounded by Stormtroopers pointing guns. Kylo and Hux stand there\\, and Rey is imprisoned on the ship. Stormtroopers search the Falcon. A Porg makes a sound\\, a Stormtrooper turns around\\, pauses\\, then continues. Cut to Finn\\, who is on a small\\, rocky moon\\, bustling with intergalactic outlaws. He enters a bar\\, where a band of Bith are playing music\\, similar to Mos Eisley Cantina in A New Hope. Finn searches for the descriptions Maz gave him\\, and he finds the man. Finn asks for his help\\, they negotiate a price\\, and leave on his ship. The plot will continue to have Kylo having a discussion with Snoke\\, who tells Kylo to bring her to him\\, then Finn and the Codebreaker infiltrating the same ship\\, where they find and rescue Rey. They manage to shut down the tracker\\, only to be discovered by stormtroopers\\, which they kill. Cuts to the Resistance. A droid informs them that the tracker has been shut down. They cheer\\, and Poe says to himself \\\"one hell of a stormtrooper\\\" referring to Finn\\, and then they exit into hyperspeed. Finn\\, Rey\\, and the Codebreaker quickly try to get to the docking bay in the armor of the stormtroopers they killed for disguises. Kylo Ren then goes to Rey's cell\\, to find that she is gone. He tells Hux to order a search of the ship. They are found\\, and the codebreaker's ship is destroyed. Now Finn owes him money for the codebreaking and for the ship. They board the Falcon\\, but in the last moment\\, Finn realizes that the codebreaker broke their cover purposefully\\, and as the Falcon takes off with the entrance hatch open\\, Finn kicks the codebreaker down into a crowd of stormtroopers\\, then blasts him in the shoulder\\, meaning to kill him. The Falcon takes off into hyperspeed. Cuts to Kylo Ren speaking with Supreme Leader Snoke\\, and Snoke expresses his anger and disappointment. Snoke uses the Force to crush Kylo Ren's mask. Kylo Ren falls in pain\\, his face covered in blood. Cut to the Resistance. The leaders decide to go to an old Resistance base on the salt planet where the climax takes place. They set their course. Cut to Ahch-To at night. Luke sits on a cliff\\, staring at the tree that holds the Jedi texts. Yoda's Force ghost will appear and talk to Luke. We get a good shot of Luke and Yoda sitting together\\, then Yoda's force ghost fading away. Cut to the Resistance\\, the fighters are now settling in the old base. Leia awakens from her unconsciousness\\, then we see Kylo Ren trying to reach her with the Force. In doing this\\, he discovers where the Resistance has fled to. This use of the Force kills Leia\\, leaving everyone around her confused and scared of this sudden death. Kylo Ren informs General Hux\\, who says to set course to that salt planet. The Resistance is now preparing for battle. Poe and Finn and the other fighters get in the pod vehicles seen in the climax. Arm Resistance troops are positioned on top of the base. The First Order ships deploy the First Order AT-AT walkers\\, about twelve of them\\, all lined up in uniform. When they are dropped\\, clouds of the red salt underneath the thin layer of white dust explode in their drop. The Resistance vehicles launch\\, in a similar lined up pattern. They dig in the ground as they go\\, creating the cool red line pattern of the salt. Finn has trouble piloting it at first. In the battle\\, many of the Resistance fighters die. Hux deploys a large weapon that will shoot a deadly ray toward the Resistance base. Finn says that the only way to stop it is to impact it. Finn pilots his vehicle right into the weapon\\, causing a large implosion that destroys all of the AT-AT walkers\\, with Hux on one\\, killing him. Poe mourns in Finn's death\\, then the three remaining vehicles turn back to the base. On the base\\, Luke arrives\\, the Resistance fighters cheering. Luke finds Leia's dead body. He tells the Resistance fighters to preserve it. (This will set up Luke using the Dark side of the force in Episode IX to bring Leia back to life). Once all of the remaining Resistance fighters are gathered in the base\\, Luke goes out to confront Kylo Ren\\, who is standing out in the battlefield\\, clouds of salt flying in the wind all around. The large First Order ship hovers above them. Luke ignites his lightsaber\\, and Kylo ignites his. Kylo charges at him\\, the lightsaber goes through Luke. Then we discover that that did no damage to Luke. Kylo looks at him in confusion\\, Luke smiles. Kylo strikes his lightsaber again and again\\, but it does nothing. Kylo orders a First Order admiral to release a bunch of TIE bombers on the Resistance base. The Millennium Falcon shows up and blasts the TIE bombers. We see Chewie in the cockpit and Rey operating the turret. Chewie roars. We see all of the Resistance fighters. All of their ships are gone\\, but Rey showing up gives them hope. We see C-3PO\\, then we hear R2-D2's beeps. C-3PO turns around and sees R2 there. He says that he missed him and 3PO pats R2 on the top. We cut to Kylo and Luke. Kylo stands there in anger. Luke says he will not be the Last Jedi\\, and that the Jedi way will live on forever. Luke starts to fade\\, and we see the real Luke on Ahch-To\\, floating on the cliff in a meditation sitting position. His eyes are closed\\, he smiles. He lowers himself\\, then his real body starts to fade\\, and we see his robe blowing in the wind. The Millennium Falcon lands above the base\\, where the remaining Resistance fighters are waiting. They board the Falcon\\, transporting Leia's body. Poe meets Rey\\, Poe tells Rey about Finn\\, she says she knew. Cut to Kylo Ren angrily boarding the First Order ship. He promotes the admiral and then goes to his chamber. Snoke's hologram reprimand's Kylo. Cut to the Falcon taking off and going into hyperspace. Rey asks Poe about the hope of the Resistance\\, then they're interrupted by Leia\\, who walks in. She says \\\"we have all we need\\\". Luke had revived her with the Force\\, and all that power\\, and using his power to project himself on the planet\\, caused his death. Cut to a large dark chamber. Snoke sits on his throne. Red guards stand around him. A First Order general\\, the one Kylo Ren promoted\\, stands before him. \\\"Ready my ship\\\" says Snoke. \\\"Where should we set the course?\\\" asks the general. The camera rests on Snoke's face. Before he can say anything\\, it cuts to the credits.\\n\\nThat's my vision. Hate it? Love it? Like it more? Like it less? I don't even know\\, but I think it's at least an improvement.","true":true}
