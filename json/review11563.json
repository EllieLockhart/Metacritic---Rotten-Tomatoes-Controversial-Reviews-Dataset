Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible Star Wars Movie.  So sad and disappointed. I've seen every Star Wars Movie from the beginning in the theater and this was the first one that made me look at my watch wondering when the disaster would end.  Just terrible story and doesn't answer any questions from the first movie (Force Awakens)  Too bad.  Seriously Too bad.","true":true}
