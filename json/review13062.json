Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what all of these people are talking about\\, great movie! I've been a Star Wars fan for the greater part of my life\\, and this movie was excellent. I find it quite hilarious that people will mock Star Wars for reusing old story telling whilst praising marvel for remaking the same movie again and again. Overall a great movie !","true":true}
