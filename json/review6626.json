Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not understand the absolute level of hate coming for this movie. Grew up on star wars\\, watched both animated series\\, played games like KOTOR and thought this was a good movie and solid new direction for the franchise. Did a hell of a lot better job explaining the force than midichlorians lol. All these people saying they will never watch another star wars movie will be first in line for the next one.","true":true}
