Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film to date. The first Star Wars movie I walked out of feeling beyond disappointed. Jokes were ridiculous and a waste of time spent on characters who were underdeveloped or completely misrepresented. Does nothing to compliment or drive the saga forward\\, it just planted the saga and the trilogy in the ground head first.  No fixing this one no matter what happens in 9. Disgrace.","true":true}
