It reminds me of Game of Thrones when anybody of the beloved characters can be killed at any time. I was truly worried and felt sorry for both Ellie and Abby.\r\rCons:\r-Bori-iii-ing gameplay while not in combat. You just walk and look for supplies. The small number of interesting puzzles. The game could be twice as short and it would be a lot better.\r- Feminist agenda\r\rAll in all\\, I'd give it 7.5\/10. I understand why all this anger and hate are taken out on this game\\, but I don't think that it actually deserves it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
