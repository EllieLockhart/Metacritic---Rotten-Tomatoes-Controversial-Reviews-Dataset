Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Even though TLOU2 have a good graphic\\, details\\, and gameplay\\, ND too focused on their agenda and forget the very first thing that brought TLOU to be GOTY which is their storyline. Tbh I'm okay if Joel die\\, because he did a bad and selfish things on TLOU ending. However\\, that doesn't mean you have to killed him that easy\\, he's not that dumb to trust a complete stranger. If you remembered\\, during TLOU\\, he knew when someone tried to trick and ambush him. If you really want to kill Joel and fit in your agenda\\, at least dont make him looks like someone who just step into post apocalyptic world. If we compared both Ellie and Abby\\, the only winner is Abby\\, she get her revenge\\, still alive\\, got new community (new firefly)\\, and new mother and daughter relationship which she should have realized that what Joel did in TLOU\\, was the same thing she did to Lev now. F-in hypocrite!ND\\, quick question\\, why bother developing both characters and their relationship in the first game if in the end you ruin them? Very disrespect Ellie and Joel character.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
