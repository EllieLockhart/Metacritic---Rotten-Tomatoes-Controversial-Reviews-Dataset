The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is not for someone wanting a feel good\\, light-hearted fairy tale. It is by far the most gritty\\, no-punches-pulled survival horror I have played to date. There is an incredibly ominous\\, dark undertone to the theme\\, which is underscored by the brutal combat between multi-dimensional\\, well developed characters. The body count of those characters that the audience has come to know and love only helps to solidify this game as an absolute gold standard in story telling.\r\rIf you played the first game and you didn't think that Joel had a reckoning coming\\, you are severely naive. He was a most smart\\, dangerous\\, cunning protagonist. He and Ellie had more than a few close calls but every time got away because his purpose was to protect her. After slaughtering all the fireflies at St. Mary's\\, he tried to prevent his fate by coldly executing Marlene\\, but he didn't get away as clean as he had hoped.\r\rNow\\, in part II\\, that reckoning and all the pain\\, anguish and fear that comes with it are unleashed on the audience. If you are angry that Joel died\\, it is because you cared about him and he was ripped away. That doesn't make this a bad story\\, it makes it the best story that can be told. One that actually makes you feel angry or sad or helpless. Then puts a goddamn gun in your hand and lets you hunt down those responsible\\, at tremendous cost.\r\rIf it is playing as Abby\\, the one who has the blood of Joel on her hands\\, that upsets you\\, then perhaps you are too short sighted to understand that she had every reason to beat him to death with an iron. He killed everyone she knew\\, including her father\\, and virtually damned the world to a fate where there will never be a solution to the cordyceps. Perhaps the most interesting perspective on this is to consider that would you have played as Abby first\\, and never known Joel\\, you would be on her side and despise him as the antagonist. Ultimately\\, Abby and Ellie are foils of eachother - Joel killed Abby's father and Abby killed Ellie's.\r\rI loved this game and it has truly been worth the wait. The gameplay was the most fun experience I've had on the sticks in a long time with the addition of prone mechanics\\, excellent dodging and crafting weapon attachments being most notable. The story was sad\\, gut-wrenching\\, horrifying\\, and bittersweet. Anyone who does not consider this game an absolute masterclass should take a step back and remember that the point of a good story is to feel something and the excellent storytellers at Naughty Dog didn't settle for a feel good crowd pleaser.\r\rWith gameplay that is polished to perfection and a story that will make you laugh at one moment\\, then cover your face in horror at the next\\, I am confident this game will not be outdone for a very long time. Thanks Naughty Dog!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
