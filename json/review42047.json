Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes one of the most beloved character of the franchise almost a villain in Luke. Disney is trying way to hard to make Kylo a more likable Vader. The only performance that is worth while is Finn. They should of let George Lucas continue his vision. Very disappointed.","true":true}
