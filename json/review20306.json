{"101487":145520,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was the best looking\\, worst movie of all time. Unbelievable. Some parts were amazing but more than two thirds of it were painfully bad. It felt like watching a dark comedy\\, not Star Wars.\\n\\nIt should have been titled \\\"The Last Sh*t\\\"\\, because it's the last sh*t I'll ever give about Star Wars\\, if they keep going down this road.\\n\\nThe film was littered with political agenda and left\/right orientation bias. Equality and diversity is fine and power to them for adding it\\, but keep the real world political overtones out of Star Wars. It's a galaxy far\\, far away for a reason!!!\\n\\nGod damn Mary Poppins Princess Leia!!! Body floating in space\\, close up\\, beautiful sendoff. Leave it at that and we have some great motive for the others now to rally together... Nope... What in the name of everything that is sacred was that atrocity?!\\n\\nA fuel crisis in a Star Wars movie. Fuel. Let that sink in...\\n\\nFlying at lightspeed can obliterate the Dreadnaught and about half a dozen full sized star destroyers\\, wtf is that nonsense. They could have just used droids to fly at lightspeed into Death Star or Starkiller Base... Save millions of lives. \\n\\nThe bombers... The bay door only opens with a goddamn remote control by some bloke up in the cargo bay????\\n\\nThe rich Monte Carlo space people were terrorised by Finn and Rose because of slave kids and animal cruelty... or some rubbish. Are we supposed to wait around for 20 years for the slave kid to become a Jedi? Is that what it was?! Sorry\\, but no...\\n\\nThat bloody useless pink haired Admiral Holdo\\, who wasn't wearing any military fatigues by the way!!! (Tarkin would turn in his space grave) Holdo and her merry band of resistance leaders were absolutely terrible and inept for the most part. \\n\\nWe don't care about the sh*tty new book storylines and we don't care if she was Leia's best friend from childhood. If she's in charge of a military movement\\, then behave like a proper military leader\\, not this rubbish cloak and daggers nonsensical dogsh*t.\\n\\nNot a single tear shed for Admiral Ackbar\\, the pro-feminist tone throughout suggests that because he's a male alien\\, he doesn't matter so we carry on like it's no big deal?! Not to mention all of Poe's scenes portrayed as a reckless man who does what he wants\\, when he wants despite causing the deaths of others. \\n\\nAnyone who agrees with me will be targeted and labelled a number of things such as being a misogynist etc. General Hux is an \\\"alt right\\\" buffoon by all accounts\\, \\\"let's make the galaxy great again\\\" etc etc... \\n\\nIf you insist of putting a male or female person in power roles\\, make them respectable and treat them as such. This was pathetic. Where are all the central alien characters if we are being equal here????\\n\\nThis entire story arc was horrendous. They can't catch up to us but we can p*ss off to another part of the galaxy for what appeared to be at least 6-8 hours\\, fly back and they still haven't been able to catch up with the carrier ship. Omg. Who green lit this crap?! And why are you allowed to kill Star Wars. You absolute cretins. \\n\\nWasting the best and most famous character by having him die from having a stroke while sitting alone on the rock. Why?! Force ghost in the next?! Why?! You should be ashamed of butchering this film.\\n\\nLuke f##king Skywalker does not spend 20 odd years in exile to \\\"redeem\\\" himself by astrally projecting himself across the galaxy to buy the others time in their moment of peril\\, only to die of exhaustion alone on a rock afterwards. Nonsense!\\n\\nLuke Skywalker is a badass who will never give up\\, no matter what the odds are\\, you cretins. You insufferable a##holes. What is the point of having him as a force ghost?!!! Just for the sake of it?! \\n\\nHe would have gone to the bitter end to try and stop Ben Solo from going to the darkside. He would have been respectful of the force and the history before it. DO NOT CALL IT A LAZER SWORD ffs.\\n\\nThe dawning realisation that the Skywalker sage ends like this is sickening. The fact that the Star Wars universe will no longer have a Skywalker descendant is appalling beyond reason.\\n\\nYou've sh*t all over what was possibly one of the greatest scenes in a Star Wars movie\\, the end scene of The Force Awakens\\, only to throw it all away. Pointless. \\n\\nRey's parental lineage arc was another discarded afterthought it seems.\\n\\nThe most interesting villain since the Emperor was treated to a few short scenes before being cast aside like a worthless peace of sh*t. \\n\\nChewie is no more than a two bit side gag. You've murdered Star Wars to peddle your agendas and force this rubbish upon us. Take it seriously ffs.\\n\\nThey've made a complete mockery of all past Star Wars lore. Slapped the fans in the face with the bad jokes\\, poor tone throughout and pointless deaths of beloved characters. \\n\\nStar Wars fans of old are not the target audience anymore it would seem. No more Jedi's or Sith. No more Lightside or Darkside. Focus on peddling a whole new line of toys and product placement\\, who cares if the film is dogs*t... The shareholders have to eat well after all!\\n\\nYou're going to get blockbuster romps through space with lots of instant gratification and little substance. Eat it up and say thanks folks.","true":true}
