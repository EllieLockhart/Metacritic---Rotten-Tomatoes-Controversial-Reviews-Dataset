Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The main problem for me is that almost the whole movie is centered around one big plot hole. Which leads to only more plot holes. The movie will be enjoyable for some. As for me\\, the flaws are way too distracting to enjoy.","true":true}
