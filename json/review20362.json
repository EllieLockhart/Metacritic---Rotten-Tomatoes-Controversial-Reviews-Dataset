Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It will be unsuitable to say that its bad or rotten because its a good movie. From a critical point of view the movie had all features so that it could be called a Good movie\\, but it is understandable from a fan's point of view that it had some problems especially with Luke's Character. But I would say whatever they did it was justifiable. The acting was pretty good throughout. The story was good but felt extended and had missed a good enough ending\\, it gives you the feeling that it will end now but it keeps on going with some good moments but a comparatively bad ending. The sense of humour sometimes or much everytime feels unnecessary. The character development like most of the Star Wars movies was good with all the things happening. The score was brilliant. Screenplay was great as well\\, the movie however you felt about it kept you invested. There were a lot of plotholes. The villain especially the supreme leader tries to be intimidating or scary like its predecessors but couldn't do so. Sometimes major points of the movie were predictable which kills the essence of the movie. But somehow I felt satisfied watching the movie the first time. All in all I rate the movie a healthy 4.5\/5 (90%)","true":true}
