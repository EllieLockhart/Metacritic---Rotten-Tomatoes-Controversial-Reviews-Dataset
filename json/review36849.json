Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was actually better than expected. Twists\\, turns\\, insights\\, action\\, and fun. No film is perfect -- 20 minutes of Canto Bight could have been elimnated by having Huldo disclose to Poe\\, which would have given more time for Rey's training. Not sure why Luke left a map in Episode VII if he -- per this movie -- did NOT want to be found. In general\\, Last Jedi delivers on most characters' (not all) motivations & developments\\, and has interesting surprises (was wondering if Kylo was trying to save his mom from freezing in space)\\, introductions to more Force abilities\\, and decent action. Whatever you're expecting to happen in this movie -- just forget it\\, sit back\\, and enjoy the ride!","true":true}
