Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was hilarious. Unintentionally. From the first 3 minutes of the movie the tone was established and for the most part it was total cheese. There was some great acting from Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver but other than that everyone else was over the top. The visuals were amazing but the script seemed like it had been written for a children's show. It was very predictable\\, except for one part which I won't spoil\\, and laughable. Also\\, other than the actors named above\\, the characters didn't seem to have any real chemistry with each other. My husband and I agreed this would make a great movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000. A couple of specifics that won't give any of the plot away. Princess Leia's manicure kept changing from bitten nails to longer gel nails. Another scene that happened early on that had us rolling our eyes was when a character was able to dislodge a remote from 30 ft above her by kicking on metal stairs. Mind you this was in a bomber spacecraft\\, assumingly pretty sturdy as it carries BOMBS. So not only was she able to dislodge it but somehow she flipped from being injured on her back to her stomach in order to catch this falling remote in the blink of an eye. It was ridiculous.","true":true}
