Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'VE BEEN Following audience revIes since The fIlm Was released and many of the older  reviews vvvvvhave straNgely   DISAPPEARED. Something fishy is going on. Russian bots? More like thE communists\/ feminists at roTten tomatoes trying to coNtrol the opinions of Others. Goes to show how far the corruption has set in. Also was extre hato set up an accouNt to post - perhaps to stop people from posting negative reviews? The new film wasn't good not just for a star wars film but for any film. Too many plot contrivances\\, many scenes were jarringly strung together which didnt maje for an overall logical sequence of events.","true":true}
