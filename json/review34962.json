Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film ruins Star Wars\\, something Lucas couldn't even do over 3 movies with Jar-Jar and Hadin's help.  Rian\\, the movie is bad and you should feel bad.  TFA sucked\\, but at least it didn't kill the largest film franchise to ever exist.  People are going to look at failed films now and call them \\\"Rians\\\"\\, or damn\\, that film got \\\"Rian Johnsoned\\\".  Is it worth a watch?  Hell yeah\\, if you thought the Holiday Special was bad\\, you ain't seen nothing yet!","true":true}
