Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was awesome!! Had a lot of fun watching it. I went on premiere night and everyone was so excited to see it. I've never been in a movie theater where so many people cheered loudly and laughed and hollered together. It was great fun. Saw it in IMAX 3D and Adam Driver's massive chest really popped out of the screen right into my face. It was very memorable. Also he did an incredible job in this movie.\\n\\nI think the people who doesn't like this movie (and the new trilogy) are just old and bitter that they've outgrown star wars. Star wars is and has always been targeted towards children. Sorry that they're not specifically made for you guys anymore. I love the original trilogy as much as the next person but that was over a long time ago and they've introduced a new story now which I also love very much. I'm sure the kids love it as well. So sorry that your kids will probably like the new trilogy more than the original one. Move on please.","true":true}
