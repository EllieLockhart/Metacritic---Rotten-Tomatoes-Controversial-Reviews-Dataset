Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a travesty. It\u2019s like Disney went full Disney and decided it would be best to clean house\\, kill off the cast that made Star Wars...Star Wars..forcibly inject their own young faces regardless of chemistry\/content so they can keep the money making machine running forever. All great stories should have a beginning and an end. It is a crying shame that after being a lifelong SW fan this is what we now have been dealt. It\u2019s not like Lucas did a great job with the prequels\\, but at least the main story was still...Star Wars. TLJ effectively killed the franchise. I am just so disappointed that JJ allowed this to happen and completely understand why he is going to helm Episode IX. But this might be so dead at this point that the next installment may be a zombie corpse of a movie. So disappointed. ","true":true}
