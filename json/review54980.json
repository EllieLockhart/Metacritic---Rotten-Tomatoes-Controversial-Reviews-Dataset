Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a visually beautiful and well acted film\\, but there's a reason the audience score is the lowest of any Star Wars film (56%). Like many\\, I hated almost every major plot decision in it. Snoke was supposed to be the most powerful villain yet and had successfully manipulated Kylo for years but yet he couldn't feel him turning the light saber? Also we saw Kylo stop a blaster shot mid air once but snoke couldn't stop the lightsaber? Combine that with no backstory and he's the most disappointing villain yet. Also hated how Luke died and how we never saw him in a single actual fight in either movie. So basically the two most powerful force people in the universe\\, snoke and Luke\\, both died without ever being in an actual fight with anyone. Also the force skyping between Rey and kylo was awful. \\n\\nAs someone else recently said\\, the 30 seconds of Vader kicking ass at the end of rogue one was cooler than anything I saw in this movie.","true":true}
