Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The force is FEMALE!\\\"  according to Kathleen Kennedy. This movie clearly reflects that. I have no problem with feminism\\, I'm all for equal rights etc\\, but I don't think Star Wars is the right platform to use to push any political agenda. This movie could have been good if it didn't try so hard to be politically correct. There's also a lot of plot issues that makes no sense.\\nThere's been silly star wars movies before (Jar Jar bings...)\\, but this is the first ttime I've actually thought to myself that perhaps it would have been better if Star Wars had just ended. The CGI is awesome and there's some really good action scenes\\, but that doesn't help when the entire story line is plain stupid..","true":true}
