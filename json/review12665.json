Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider myself an avid fan of all things sci-if.  With that being said\\, this movie was horrible.  The constant strained \\\"funny\\\" scenes were a hard pill to swallow after the 4th joke\\, which carried on and on with child like jokes throughout the movie.  This movie destroyed the Star Wars universe for me.  What really blows me away is the fact that the script had to have been rad by sthe verbal people before actually being filmed.  And why did they feel it was important to show the JEDI MASTER milk a sea cow?  Come on man\\,  this movie was filmed for a pg audience.  Completely disgusted that this is now part of th Star Wars franchise.  Worst movie ever in th series!","true":true}
