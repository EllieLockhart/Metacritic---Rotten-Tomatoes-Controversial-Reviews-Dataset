The first title has a story about humanity fighting against infected zombies...you try to save the world by inventing a vaccine...In lou2 that isn't even part of their idea...every controversy decision made in lou1 is not really important...it's more about shocking you and tell stories about people i do not care about...Naughty dog has gone from masterpiece to an ok game 5\/10 if you don't know lou1... 2\/10 if you do...Too bad!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
