Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the haters. Yes\\, are there some things you'll shake your head at a bit in this film. But then\\, 5 seconds later\\, you're rolling with them. There's an occasional clunker in the jokes. But seriously\\, this is a huge\\, sweeping story. Twists\\, turns\\, awesome battle scenes\\, heroes\\, villains\\, conflict.  It's easily in the top two of all the films\\, neck and neck with the other great 2nd of 3\\, ESB. And yes\\, I'm old. I've seen these all\\, lots of times\\, all the way back to the originals of my childhood. Just go see this. The audience score of 55% is nonsense. That's the bots talking\\, trying to let some juvenile punks screw it up for everyone. This film is awesome\\, and you need to see it on a big screen\\, not on your TV once you realize you missed it.","true":true}
