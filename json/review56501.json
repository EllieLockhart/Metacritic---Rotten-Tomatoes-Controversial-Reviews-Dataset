Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens was like an adrenaline shot to the heart from start to finish. The Last Jedi is a carefully built movie like layers of phyllo dough. Scene by scene story arc by story arc this movie builds death\\,  balance and substance to the characters we fell in love with in the force awakens but aren't quite sure why.\\n\\nWithout revealing any spoilers it's notable with the movie ends and what some might think of his anti-climatic but for those of us that remember The Empire Strikes Back we had a similar feeling that the story was as yet incomplete.\\n\\nThat would seem natural in a 3 movie Saga.\\n\\nThe characters have continued to develop both the characters we lovingly remember from the original trilogy and the new characters that we were introduced to in the force awakens.\\n\\nAt first blush I had a hard time seeing beloved characters in this newer more mature state. I have however reflected on it and come to the conclusion that the events that surrounded Luke Leia Han and the others through the original trilogy would surely have shaped the last 20 years of their lives and manifested in unique ways many of which are explored in this film as character seek to resolve a number of issues.\\n\\nFor the fan that is nervous this is an accessible film to the Casual movie fan as well as to the hardcore fan of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
