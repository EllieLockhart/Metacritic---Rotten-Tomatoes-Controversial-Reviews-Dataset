Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals are the only thing slightly redeemable in this film. A carbon copy of the originals in a corporate cash grab. Possibly the worst film in this trilogy of money grubbing sequels. The lazy writing\\, fan-bait\\, and political undertones (it's not subdued in the slightest) all combine to make a movie that can ruin an entire series. Well done Disney\\, you've manage to ruin millions of childhoods with 300 million dollars and corporate pandering.","true":true}
