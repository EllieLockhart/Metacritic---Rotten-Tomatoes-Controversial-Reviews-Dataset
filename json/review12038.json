Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely love this movie. I felt that Star Wars: The Last Jedi was beautifully written. I understand why people have disagreed with Rian Johnson's vision\\, however\\, I love the original story that he brought into the franchise. I'll admit\\, I was surprised to see the changes made by Johnson but\\, I think that a majority of the film flowed together with that same Star Wars spunk we all know and love. There was one storyline in the film that I found to drag slightly in the middle of the film. Other than that\\, I really don't have a problem with anything else in the movie. Growing up with Star Wars\\, I am really happy with the latest installment. In truth\\, I think that The Last Jedi should not be seen as\\, \\\"too different\\\" but as something that can continue to inspire us just like the original trilogy did.","true":true}
