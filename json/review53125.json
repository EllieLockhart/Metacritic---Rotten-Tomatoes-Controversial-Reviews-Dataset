Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A visual masterpiece with outstanding artistry and execution that unfortunately was not able to makes us feel this is a Star-wars Film. Extremely out of sync to the point that makes this movie seem out of place in the Star Wars universe and not complementary of the saga we all love.\\nThis movie can be emotionally engaging but the timing of its comedic\\, tragic and epic values are not articulated properly rendering it confusing and anticlimactic.","true":true}
