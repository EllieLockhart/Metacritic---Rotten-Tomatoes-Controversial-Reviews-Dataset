Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan (not a fanboy) of the SWU\\, the overall plot and structure of this story was a disappointment. It's possible the story of the resistance attempting an escape from their pursuers as well as the adventure of Finn and Rose could have been made in to an awesome in between book from episodes 7 & 8. It all felt so forced and so off balance that I walked away bummed. Oh well\\, win some lose some. Production value was top notch and that is always key for SW. So I'll give it that.","true":true}
