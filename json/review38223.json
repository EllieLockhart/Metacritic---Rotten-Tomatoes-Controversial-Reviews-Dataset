Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals and soundtrack are fantastic but the movie fails every obligation to the running series universe in spectacular fashion.  Bad writing\\, broken character arcs and plot holes plague the film along with universe shattering continuity breaks- one of which is on a catastrophic scale.  Viewers who are new to the franchise or have no investment in its universe and are willing to not think to hard will be pleased but the rest will feel extremely frustrated.","true":true}
