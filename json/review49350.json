Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie yet.  I never write reviews\\, but had to sign up for an account just because I disliked this movie so much.  I don't think the writer\/director is a Star Wars fan at all.  They obviously didn't know what would appeal to fans who actually grew up loving these movies.  Awful.","true":true}
