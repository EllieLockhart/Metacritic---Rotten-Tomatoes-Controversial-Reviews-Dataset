Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Lost Jedi is an abomination and outright insult to anything called star wars.\\nThe Lost Jedi makes no sense at all but instead focuses on shock over plot.\\nRian Johnsons take is shameful. My advice to Disney look at the story of Revenge of the Sith and The Empire Strikes Back. Both of those movies had compelling stories which made sense.\\n\\nBoooooooooo. Lame attempt","true":true}
