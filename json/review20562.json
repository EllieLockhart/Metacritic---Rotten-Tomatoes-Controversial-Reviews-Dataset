Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been so board During a star wars movie. I wouldn't say it's as bad as Clone Wars\\, but I'd put it at Phantom Menace level of awfulness. There are some cool part\/scenes but most of the movie is running around (and not in the good way like rogue one) with some really weird \\\"choices\\\". There were multiple times when I laughed out loud during serious parts. Especially when characters fly through space. Also they throw away some of the most interesting\/mysterious characters from the first movie and we learn nothing about them. It feels like this movie and plot should have been an animated\\, straight to DVD movie. I hope that when the hype dies down people will start realising that this movie is bad.
