Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie spits upon original themes and characters. Rubbish character development\\, terribly awful villains. Darth Vader was legendary. Nothing about the new franchise is legendary. Star Wars has died a sad death by bas sequels. RIP Childhood memories.","true":true}
