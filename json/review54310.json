Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to write a review for the first time ever. I\u2019ve been a Star Wars fan since a child. Disney\u2019s move to hire Rian Johnson was a huge mistake! If something works\\, don\u2019t fix it! He changed a classic into a try too hard\\, corny\\, one liner space ball mess. Really? Do you think after all this time\\, that we envision Princess Leia and Luke\u2019s reunion to be her saying.. \u201cI know I changed my hair\u201d!!? And the scene changes that was a trademark of SW ..all gone. Along with all the original characters now! And why? What was the point of Luke dying? And why did he just die? I mean Carrie is gone\\, you killed off Harrison\\, so why take Mark out of it? And Rey and Bens connection was a let down! Princess Leia floating through space just weird and like Snoke wouldn\u2019t realize that Kylo was about to kill him... wow! Powerful with the force he is! And the entire movie was built up on who Rays parents are.. and guess what? They\u2019re nobodies! Some exciting twist there! So SW is dead and full of new unfunny characters. Thanks Disney and thanks Rian for ruining a masterpiece!","true":true}
