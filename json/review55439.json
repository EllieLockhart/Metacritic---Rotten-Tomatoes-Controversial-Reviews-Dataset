Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mediocre. This movie took a bunch of risks and succeeded with some. I will put emphasis on the SOME though\\, because there were lots of risks they miserably failed at. As a Star Wars fan\\, this is a welcome twist for me\\, and there were a lot of surprising moments\\, but let me just say this now; **so many characters were wasted**\\, either through common method of death\\, or just not establishing them in the first place and just let them BE there\\, but not do ANYTHING that accelerates the plot. Even some of the characters I had such high hopes for elaboration went right out the window\\, with no consideration as to the hype and theories built up around them. \\nI will admit\\, it's humorous\\, and definitely something that a Star Wars movie can somewhat have\\, but there are too many wasted opportunities and too many unnecessary twists that make me feel like it's lacking in a bit too much.","true":true}
