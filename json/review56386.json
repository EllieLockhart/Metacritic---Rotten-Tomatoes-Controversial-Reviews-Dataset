Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly\\, terribly bad movie. I don't blame the actors really. Especially the main cast. The only one's to blame are Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy. Plot points\\, dropped. Continuity\\, what is that? Useless dialogue and screen time for redundant content\\, yup. Destroying the childhood of millions of fans\\, yup. Major disappointment\\, yup. I'd spend more time bashing this movie but I've done it too many times before. My money was wasted on this movie and I wish I could get it back and unsee what I witnessed when I watched this horrible movie but alas\\, both are impossible. In conclusion\\, don't waste your money on the dvd releases\\, nor your time watching it on t.v.\/online. Anything is better than this\\,","true":true}
