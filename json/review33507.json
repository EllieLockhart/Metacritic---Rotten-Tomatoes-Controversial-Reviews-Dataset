Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, disappointing\\, could have honoured carrie fisher but decided against\\, Mark hammill can't act and neither can daisy Ridley\\, star wars is ruined\\, can only hold on to sequels and HOPE they're not as much of a shambles as the last jedi\\, too many women added as well","true":true}
