Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"everything's wrong with the movie! Yes\\, the CGI are nice\\, but that's it. Every plotlines from Ep.7 was way too rushed or simply destroyed in a awfull way. And everything you know and loved from star wars is scrapped\\, it just doesn't feel like a Star wars\\, it feels like a bad interpretation of the star wars universe. \\n\\nYes\\, I understand that they wanted to make something different\\, but changing a good story to a badly made one wasn't a good trade. And they had the chance to finish the story of Leia since Carry sadly left this world last year\\, instead they converted her in Mary Poppins.\\nThis movie was a huge dissapointment and it will be hard to do something for Ep.9 with that as a base.","true":true}
