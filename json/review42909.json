{"101487":186971,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-01","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so disappointing in so many ways.  I loved the original trilogy and I was really impressed with The Force Awakens and Rogue One.  While the prequels weren't my favorite\\, they look like masterpieces compared to this movie.\\n\\nI did not like the attempts at humor in this movie.  They are not on par with Star Wars humor.  I don't like the Superman Leia bit\\, I wondered if it was one of the movie's corny jokes\\, it was that hard to take it seriously.\\n\\nI don't like how Luke was portrayed.  In The Force Awakens we learn that he is training a new generation of Jedi.  In TLJ we find out that he tried to kill his nephew in his sleep.  Nothing about how Luke acts in this movie is in line with the Luke from the originals.  He was a hero and master Jedi\\, now he is crank and coward.\\n\\nI wished to have seen more backstory with Rey and Kylo Ren.  I still believe there is more to her than drunk parents.  Is she really a Skywalker?  Her training is minimal and incomplete and Kylo Ren\\, after killing Snoke\\, takes over as master villian of the 1st Order.  But\\, I don't put him on the same level with any other SW villian.  He has a ways to go there.\\n\\nI think Poe was supposed to have taken on a leadership role in the Resistance\\, but he comes off as just a mouthy rebel against his own people (but I think that was intentional\\, cuz you know\\, he's a man and therefore knows nothing).  Finn does not act like the soldier he was trained to be and is wasted in this movie.\\n\\nThere are 3 new characters introduced in TLJ.  Holdo is ok.  She takes over when Leia is incapacitated.  There wasn't much to her\\, just seems serious about her mission and putting Poe in his place.\\n\\nRose is a mechanic for the Resistance and goes to find a hacker with Finn.  They go to a casino and this was the worst part of the movie for me.  The scene is odd and they accomplish nothing.  And\\, I believe that we are supposed to think that Rose is plucky and fierce\\, but I really did not like this character at all.  She got on my nerves early on in the movie and unfortunately was in a large chunk of it.  She lectures Finn about class warfare and animal rights and then sets a bunch of race animals free.  It was really pointless and she made a bad movie worse for me.\\n\\nThe hacker they go to find was DJ.  I actually liked this character the most out of all the new ones.  He wasn't featured a lot\\, but seemed the most interesting.  He ends up double-crossing Finn and Rose\\, but he seems to have some redeeming qualities deep down\\, maybe?  He would be the only new character that I would like to see in the next SW film.\\n\\nI don't know what is left to work with after this movie butchered interesting characters...Snoke is dead\\, Phasma is dead\\, Rey is a nobody\\, Luke is dead\\, etc.  I like the actor that plays Kylo Ren and the actress that plays Rey.  I hope they are unleashed a little more in the next movie.  I'd like to see more of the Hacker\\, DJ too.  I found him interesting.  I hope Rose is not in the next one (I'm not sure if she died in this one or not).\\n\\nI'll likely see the next movie\\, but it depends on what characters are in it and who directs it.  I would not recommend The Last Jedi.  And\\, I am not a bot.","true":true}
