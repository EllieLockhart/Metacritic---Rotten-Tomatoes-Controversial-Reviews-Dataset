Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killing off Snoke is one the most waste of a bad ever same with Fin and rose nothing teach about them plus luke skywalker history is dead to me everything was dead  of plot holes not just that characters were all over the place in the movie there was meaning who was watch know the history of a character no lightsaber fights","true":true}
