Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure\\, the movie looks good. But the challenge of any speculative fiction narrative (fantasy or sci-fi) is elaborate world \/ universe creation. This includes creating mythos and rules that subsequent contributors to the universe must live by - if we want the narrative consumers to maintain interest. This is a Star Wars movie because there are lightsabers characters say 'may the force be with you'? Rian Johnson foolishly disrespected the universe in which these narratives are told - to his\\, and his overlords'\\, peril. You heard it here: this beautiful travesty is not going to have legs... \\n\\nThat's force sensitivity.","true":true}
