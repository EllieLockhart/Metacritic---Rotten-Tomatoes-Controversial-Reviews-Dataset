Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had to think about this one. I left the theater feeling upset but unable to articulate exactly why. Upon reflection\\, it comes to this: However much I might disagree with the way the film went\\, it would have been OK if it had been well-worn\\, but it is not. Well-known characters act radically different than they should\\, potholes abound\\, and payoffs from the previous film are dropped. Because of the doors Ep8 closed\\, I don't care enough about what remains to want to see Ep9.","true":true}
