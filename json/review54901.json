Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard for me get know how to rate this. The payoff for some of the risks was great. Overall the pacing was off and my biggest problem is with the direction taken with the character of Luke Skywalker. It's not consistent with the character from the original trilogy. Additionally set ups from the last movie were seemingly passed over. My perception of this show could change with the last installment but for now\\, it falls short.","true":true}
