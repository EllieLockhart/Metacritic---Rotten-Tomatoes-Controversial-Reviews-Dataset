Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not into writing a long review ...but that was a long drawn out movie.  I was kinda bummed when I left the theater... I am just a tad nerdly and not a movie critic per se but how on earth did it get such high critic ratings??!? All I can think of is that enough money greased some palms... Hahaha\\, when I got home I actually had to get back on RT to look again\\, now I see I am not alone in my liking of this movie.","true":true}
