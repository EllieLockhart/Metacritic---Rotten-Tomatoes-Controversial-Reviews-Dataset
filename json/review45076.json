Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming\\, confusing and disappointing\\, The Last Jedi is a comparable slap in the face to the far more coherent and interesting narrative of The Force Awakens. Despite being the longest Star Wars film\\, it felt like a lot of the scenes could have been cut\\, especially the big excursion which turned out to be a fruitless prank anyway - it wasn't fun or overly surprisingly. And the stuff with Luke? That tops it all. A film should be able to make sense\\, but I am still incredibly confused and diappointed in the end of the film. It really is a shame the franchise has dipped so noticeably.","true":true}
