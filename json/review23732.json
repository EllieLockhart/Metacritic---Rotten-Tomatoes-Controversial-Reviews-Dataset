Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke's Death was sooooo bad lol. Mary Sue got character development in one line from Kylo. Snoke of course was the most interesting character because I imagined all the cool things they could of done with him and didn't. All Old Star Wars male human characters now dead but Carry Fisher can survive being blown out into space cuz...the force. LAZY WRITING! I have actually been more entertained by youtube vids about the old star wars EU than this movie. The world's longest chase scene with things happened so slowly. Oh and dont worry\\, no matter how bad things get for our heroes\\, unrealistic instant solutions present themselves.  Never did I want the ending of a star wars movie to come so fast and I suffered watching Jar Jar binks in theaters!","true":true}
