Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is entertaining and if you're not totally into Star Wars\\, it might be fun as a stand-alone movie.  But if you have followed the adventure from the beginning\\, this movie will disappoint and perhaps anger.  Forget the critics who must have some love fest with anything Disney\\, they are dead wrong calling this a classic.","true":true}
