Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a fan of Star Wars for over 35 years and I don't know how the critics can call The Last Jedi \\\"fresh\\\". It is a rehash of the Empire Strikes Back and honestly way too long along with the characters that just don't matter. My wife asked if i wanted to see it again with her and I told her that it's not worth it and we can watch it when it comes as a rental. ( I won't be buying this movie)","true":true}
