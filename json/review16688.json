Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never have comented on any fourm in my life\\, but as a life-long Star wars fan I felt insulted and offended by this film. I will never support my once beloved franchise again. \\n\\nThis film is complete shite. It's is all about political activists attempting to use the star wars franchise to move feminist agendas and not star wars. On top that\\, it is laughably full of plot holes\\, poorly casted and seems to undermine anything the previous film built.","true":true}
