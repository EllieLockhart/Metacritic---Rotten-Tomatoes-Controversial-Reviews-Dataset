Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was terrible. So many dumb\\, out of place\\, comic breaks\\, there should have been a laugh track. VII was awesome\\, this movie ruined Luke Skywalker. I might be done with Star Wars.","true":true}
