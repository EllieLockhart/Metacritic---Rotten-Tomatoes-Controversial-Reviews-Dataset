Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed - too long. Too many characters. Sub plots there to give them something to do. Not all bad but first SW film that didn't tempt me back to watch again.","true":true}
