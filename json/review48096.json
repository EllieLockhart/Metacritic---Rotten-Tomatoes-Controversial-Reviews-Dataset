Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Last Jedi wasn't what I was expecting\\, I did enjoy it and thought it was a really good movie. It was a little different than most other Star Wars movies but to me that just makes unique. That doesn't take away from the enjoyment of watching it. There are some questions that I would have liked to have seen answered. They might answer them in the next one if possible. Only time will tell.","true":true}
