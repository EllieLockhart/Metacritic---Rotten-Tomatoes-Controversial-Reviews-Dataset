Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like I'm watching my favorite film franchise of all time being turned into a nothing more than a money making machine. I can't even enjoy the end of Return of the Jedi\\, knowing that this is where the story goes from here. The Last Jedi is full of cringeworthy attempts at humor\\, bad acting\\, plot holes\\, characters you really don't care about\\, and a mishandling of the ones that you did care about. The Force Awakens wasn't very good in my book\\, but it at least left the door open for some interesting stories to be told in The Last Jedi. Any character development or backstory revelations you were hoping for are nonexistent. At this point\\, I'm hoping JJ Abrams finds some way to just salvage the trilogy. After seeing this\\, I'm not very excited that Rian Johnson will be creating a whole new trilogy in the years to come. DISAPPOINTED.","true":true}
