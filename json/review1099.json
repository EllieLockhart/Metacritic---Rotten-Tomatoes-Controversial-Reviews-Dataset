Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unfortunate disappointment. There are some excellent action sequences\\, though they are limited in number\\, and the movie itself is beautiful\\, but the story is where the problems reside. The movie felt like it was around 30 minutes too long\\, which was exacerbated by the fact that many characters were completely wasted and entire subplots were unnecessary. A missed opportunity to build off of the momentum of TFA","true":true}
