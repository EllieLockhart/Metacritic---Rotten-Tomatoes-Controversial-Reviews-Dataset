Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ha destruido mis ilusiones con Los Ultimos Jedi\\, tenia muchas espectativas pero me ha defraudado\\, lo que han hecho con Luke es miserable. La trama de los padres de Rey basura. La muerte tonta de Snoke ( quien es de donde procede ...) en fin espero que JJ lo arregle con el episodio IX","true":false}
