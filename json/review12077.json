Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with many of the negative reviews and won't repeat the many reasons that others have elaborated upon\\, instead\\, I want to address the elephant in the room here... I've seen page after page of 1\/2 star and 1 stat audience reviews\\, yet the audience score sits at 49%. How is this possible? I've heard that half stars don't count and if that is true\\, it is very dishonest and manipulative on the part of RT. Many in the media have suggested that the negative audience reviews were \\\"review bombed\\\" by disgruntled fans but I see the opposite. I see many well written\\, well thought out critiques of this movie and it's story telling choices and an audience score that in no way reflects that until you dig in and read the reviews. So I guess this experience has left me with two big takeaways. \\n1. I no longer trust Disney's handling of Star Wars. They are more interested in quick profit and political\/social lecturing as opposed to telling good stories and offering imagination and escapism. \\n2. I no longer trust Rotten Tomatoes for being an impartial barometer of the audience response to a movie.","true":true}
