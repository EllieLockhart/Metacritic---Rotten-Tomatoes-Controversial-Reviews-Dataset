Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS!! (how cares anyway...)\\nVisuals and music are strong on this one (that's my 1 star)... but apart of that? the script is bad\\, the jokes are placed forced... phone call prank?! REALLY?!! there is no respect for a single thing... physics is a science fiction element on this science fiction movie... bombs dropping on zero gravity\\, breathing out of space... (I don't even know how the hell Kilo turn around the ship after shooting inside the big ship hangar!) Finn wasted\\, same as Phasma\\, IDIOTIC characters (yes.. I'm talking about Rose) with idiotic motivations... a pile of shit over Luke!... a newbie with less than a week with a lightsaber in her hands winning over guys with entire lives training!! is like going into Mike Tison's house and asking him to be your teacher... he say no\\, so you start punching a damn pillow... even if his retired and old as shit\\, he's gonna take the crap out of you!!!\\n\\nDON'T LOOSE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!! The Phantom Menace is better!! and I'm not kidding... have a better plot\\, better structure\\, damn!! even the editing looks more like a Star Wars film!!","true":true}
