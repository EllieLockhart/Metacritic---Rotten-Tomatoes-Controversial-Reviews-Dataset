Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a decent enough movie. The performances were solid. Adam Driver was a standout with his portrayal of Kylo Ren. John Williams DID IT AGAIN! That score was brilliant! Unfortunately\\, though the movie has some huge flaws in crucial areas. Some storytelling decisions made no logical sense and at times seemed like it was INTENTIONALLY trying to aggravate Star Wars fans. Some storylines went absolutely nowhere and other characters were absolutely disregarded with their lack of screen time. I LOOOOOVE Star Wars and I really wanted to enjoy this movie but the mistakes of this movie had me saying things like \u201cReally?\u201d and \u201cWTF?\u201d and not in a good way. Unfortunately\\, this movie just isn\u2019t good.","true":true}
