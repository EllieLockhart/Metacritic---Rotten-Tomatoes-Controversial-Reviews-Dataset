Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Listen\\, none of the story arcs introduced in this movie got a resolution. None of the ones that should have gotten a resolution gotba resolution. Characters were added and then immediately discarded. Many of the things the director promised for this movie didn't happen. So many of the characters had really backtracked their progression from the last movie including Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rey. Like was a disgrace to what we know of his character in the original movies. Overall it just seemed like sloppy stories and sloppy characterization and I really hope JJ fixes it when he does the next movie.","true":true}
