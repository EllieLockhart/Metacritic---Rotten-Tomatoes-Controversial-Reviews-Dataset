Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst Star War movies to date. \\nCharacters are all over the place\\, pointless side stories\\, Luke character wasn't well written. Princess Leia character didn't make any sense. Too many characters. Awful misplaced humour \\, Snoke was just the most poorly thought villain who has so much potential. Rey is far to OP\\, if you go back to old SW movies you will see Jedi require training. Kylo Ren seems like a teenager with bipolar issues. Rey can just get around everywhere without explanation. They also go to Las Vegas. lol\\n\\nI can go on.","true":true}
