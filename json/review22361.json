Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Laughingly boring story line\\, no character development\\, terrible decision making from the characters. Contrived rubbish. Massive star wars fan but can't wait this trilogy to end now\\, so try can actually start doing some original movies.","true":true}
