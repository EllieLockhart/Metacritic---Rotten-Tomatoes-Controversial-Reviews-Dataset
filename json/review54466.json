Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it... to the point where I've been totally distracted at work thinking about it.  I like the direction things are going and disagree with folks that think that it's too much of a departure from the original trilogy and the vision of George Lucas.  I think that it continues a lot of the original themes of light\\, dark\\, love\\, hate\\, forgiveness and flawed human character.  I also think that it ties in to Episodes 1-3 (which I hated) in interesting ways.  As for the people whining about not getting their closure from Episode 7...  they're building more to come.  Just because you have some formulaic approach to how movies should be made doesn't mean it always works out that way.  I think this was a great episode and gives the Star Wars universe more depth.","true":true}
