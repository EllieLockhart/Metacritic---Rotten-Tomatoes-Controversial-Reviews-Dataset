Did Abby kill anyone's dad or are all her victims without children?\rThe game is waaaaay too long and maybe I could've been ok with it ending at the theater or maybe even after saving Abby. I would still have preferred killing her but hey\\, it's still a stupid ending. But then you fight her and still let her go?? I can enjoy games and movies with non happy endings but this is just insanely stupid and it makes our favorite characters look like incredibly unlucky ** while the bodybuilding psychopath gets her revenge (killing the main character we all loved) and still gets away with everything.\r\rBtw Joel also saved the world by not letting the fireflies develop a vaccine that would've made them the most powerful faction in a world of criminals so yeah... You're welcome!\rAnd my vote is even without considering the SJW propaganda you try to force down our throats.\rInsanely idiotic storyline and SJW culture everywhere. You want to make a game about lesbian love? Sure go for it. A game about a bodybuilding woman? Hey I think she's still hot enough and would definitely nail her\\, so sure. A game about a trans preteen running from the fanatic family? I guess. Big broomhilde (from Robinhood men in fights) hammer wielding tank class? Ooooookay. Female deity for the fanatics? Fine. Another female guard saying \\\"I'm gonna be on a shift with my girlfriend later ;)\\\"... Isn't that a little too much to shove into one game? Just a huuuuuge coincidence right?\rThis is my first review on a non YouTube video.. that's how much I'm disgusted by the story of this game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
