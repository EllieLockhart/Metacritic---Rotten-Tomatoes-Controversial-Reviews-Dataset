Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars. This systematic deconstruction is a sneering middle finger to everyone who ever found meaning in Star Wars. Nihilist Rian Johnson and GloboCorp hack Kathleen Kennedy decided to vandalize Star Wars because believers of meaningful things terrify and confuse their small souls. \\n\\nThe film goes far\\, far out of its way to render anything and everything in it utterly pointless and mock the idea of any alternative. This is explicitly personified by the shocking \\\"lightsaber toss\\,\\\" an attempt to shatter the audience's sense of symbolic meaning\\, as the iconic Skywalker weapon and climax of the previous film is carelessly thrown away. The pointed character assassination of the hero Luke Skywalker speaks for itself. Mark Hamill was sadly run over by this machine. \\n\\nCharacters\\, plot\\, backstory\\, mythology - all were subject to needless nihilism. There was no transcendence from the past\\, Johnson's pretentious half-rationalization\\, for he has only led us to a void of meaning\\, reflective of his capabilities. Simply put\\, those responsible did a mean\\, hurtful thing because they could. No amount of obvious corporate manipulation will make normal people support this pointed attack on the things they love.","true":true}
