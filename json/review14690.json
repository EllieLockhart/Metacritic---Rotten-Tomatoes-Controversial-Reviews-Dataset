Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never considered leaving a review till now.\\n\\nGlad to see I'm not the only one.\\n\\nSnoke goes out like Boba Fett (ie a bitch) Rey turns out to be nobody\\, and about a half hour of wasted time that was passed off as comedic relief.\\n\\nSeriously the movie could have been a half hour shorter.\\n\\nThere were some great scenes\\, but far too many poor moments that eclipse them entirely.\\n\\nWhat a disappointment. J J Abrams did it right\\, despite reliving a new hope. \\n\\nLast Jedi... The name is right. It'll be the last Jedi movie I see in theaters\\, that's for sure.","true":true}
