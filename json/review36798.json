Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie sucked completely.  I already saw the battle on ice planet Hoth and the O.J. Simpson slow speed chase.  I wanted to like the movie but am past the point of pretending a movie was good when it really was lousy out of a sense of loyalty to a particular franchise.  I am advising everyone I know that hasn't seen it yet to wait until it is on ABC so that they do not have to waste their money.  I am a lifelong Star Wars fan since the beginning\\, but this was a piece of crap.  I gave it 1\/2 star for the fight sequence in Snokes throne room.","true":true}
