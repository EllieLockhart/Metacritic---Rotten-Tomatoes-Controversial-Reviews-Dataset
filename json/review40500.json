Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is the movie that killed star wars. the protagonist is a flawless perfect Mary sue who after growing up alone on a desert planet can suddenly\\, without training or effort defeat a trained sith lord in a lightsabre dual\\, challenge this trained\\, experienced force user in jedi mind powers\\, fly the millennium falcon better then han sole\\, repair it better then chewie\\, and litterally do anything else the story requires with ZERO training\\, she has not even read how to be a jedi for dummies and is doing things anikin took years to learn. on top of this\\, the antagonist is a spoiled brat you can't even really hate him\\, you just want to whip his bum and send him to his room without supper. the last to movies spent so much time building up the mystery and suspense around these characters and then poof\\, nothing comes of it. she's not special she's just dirt poor average nobody snoke is dead so who carred who he was etc","true":true}
