Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to give atleast 2 stars because it\u2019s a starwars movie. Aside from a few scenes that made true starwars fans happy the movie felt like it was rushed\\, uncomfortable\\, and full of forced laughs... the story was non existent. It left you with no desire to see the next one\\, and also no clue with that it\u2019ll be about! Very sad that I wasted 2 years being excited to see this movie only to be let completely down.
