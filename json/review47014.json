Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment.  I am a HUUGE Star Wars fan and had so much hope for this after seeing the critics rating.  After all\\, it is usually the critics that tend to be harsher on movies.  This flick never took off\\, went on wild trips that had nothing to do with the plot or overall theme\\, and it killed off some of the best people.  Completely ruined it when the main bad dude was killed.  Rian went a complete different direction than what fans were asking for.  If you are not a Star Wars fan\\, then it wasn't a bad movie.  Below is my rating for Star Wars movies from best to worst:  1) Empire Strikes Back 2) Return of the Jedi 3) Star Wars 4) The Force Awakens 5)Revenge of the Sith 6) The Last Jedi (barely above the last two).  7) Phantom Menace 8) Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
