Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People love to talk about how daring this film was with its subverting of expectations. What they fail to mention is how every time they had the opportunity to take the movie in a meaningful direction (Leia's death\\, Fin's sacrifice\\, Rey joining Kylo) they end up pulling their punches last minute. What did we end up with? The most cliched\\, overused Star Wars narrative: Small rag tag band of Rebels vs Massive Empire. So innovative and daring\\, can't wait to see Rey fight Kylo for the third time. Snoke? No we don't need to know about him\\, or the origins of the First Order and how they came to be so powerful with near infinite resources.","true":true}
