Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty much everything is an ESB rehash with some ROTJ thrown in to try throw you off the fact that it's a rehash. It's more a marvel movie than A Star Wars movie\\, Luke and Kylo are the only good things in this film but even they quip every 2 seconds. See this if you are a Luke fan otherwise skip it. \\n\\n2 stars\\, it's beautifully shot and Mark Hamill steals the show\\, pretty much everything else from pink haired admirals to Rey being the worst \\\"Jedi\\\" ever is terrible.","true":true}
