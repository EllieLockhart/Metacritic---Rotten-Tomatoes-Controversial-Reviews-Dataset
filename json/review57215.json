Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie clearly shows the ineptitude with which Disney has handled the Star Wars franchise. They seemingly wish to do injustice to the classic trilogy characters by giving them meaningless\/mysterious deaths and in the case of the beloved Droids\\, resign them to the background. The new characters who appeared to have promise in The Force Awakens (with the exception of Poe) saw little to no growth or development which is in itself a shameful in occurrence. The mishandling of Luke Skywalker (hinted at in interviews with Mark Hamill) was worse than one could have imagined. In retrospect\\, the original trilogy characters should have not been utilized by Disney for the sequels\\, rather they should have been utilized in The Force Awakens in order to hand over the proverbial torch before any damage could be done to their legacy and subsequent disappeared without a trace. The promises made by the creators that not only would Leia receive a nice \\\"send off\\\" and that Rey's parentage would be satisfying was an outright phallacy. One has to wonder what will be done with Leia in the next installment and fans must face the fact that Rey's parents are two dead alcoholic scavengers who sold her for beer money. Shame on you Disney. This franchise had unlimited potential\\, yet you have squandered it completeley.","true":true}
