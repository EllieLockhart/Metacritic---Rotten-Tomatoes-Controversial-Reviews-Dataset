Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Interesting to see how divisive this movie is.  For me\\, it was very reminiscent of the prequels (and\\, to be clear\\, I don't hate the prequels.  I enjoy them well enough).  \\n\\nIt was so much fun to be back in the Star Wars universe\\, but I found myself repeatedly thinking \\\"Really?  You decided to go in THAT direction?\\\"  It is well made\\, beautiful to look at\\, with some great Star Wars scenes.  It's also a bit all-over-the-place\\, has some terribly developed characters\\, and has a central story-line that's paper thin (and a bit nonsensical).  After The Force Awakens reminded everybody of what they loved about the series\\, this served to remind me of prequels.  Just with better acting.\\n\\nOf the nine main Star Wars movies released\\, I put this one in the bottom three.","true":true}
