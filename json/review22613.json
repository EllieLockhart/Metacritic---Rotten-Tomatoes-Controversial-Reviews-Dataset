Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lifelong Star Wars fan here...I thought this movie was excellent\\, maybe 4th best behind ESB\\, ANH\\, and Jedi with Rogue 1 close behind.  Like ESB\\, TLJ dramatically expands the scope of the Star Wars universe--this is in direct contrast to what I thought was the play-it-safe recasting of ANH that was TFA.  I love how it re-democratizes the series: you don't have to be in the Skywalker family to use the force or to lead a rebellion.  I also love how it didn't try to shoehorn every character and their backstory in to the film no matter how silly it made their origin story (lookin' at you 3PO).  And the last Holdo scene...wow.  I have never heard so many audible gasps from an audience (including me) as I did when that occurred.  And then it happened again when we learn how Luke had tricked Kylo!  Yes\\, there are some plot holes\\, and yes\\, the whole Canto Bight foray was probably unnecessary.  But I find those to be weak arguments against what is otherwise a fantastic film.  An easy 5 stars!","true":true}
