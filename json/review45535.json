Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed with TLJ! As a huge Star Wars fan this was my most anticipated movie of the year and it did not live up to the hype. I'll put it like this\\, one of my favorite directors is Quentin Tarantino but I wouldn't want him to direct a Star Wars movie because it would be his style and not Star Wars\\, that's what happened with this movie. It definitely did not feel like a Star Wars movie\\, ruined the greatest hero in a galaxy far\\, far away\\, and I can only hope JJ will be able to salvage episode IX.","true":true}
