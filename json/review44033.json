Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ as an individual entity is a fine movie but as a part of bigger franchise that this movie failed to deliver the purpose of connect with past and setup for the future. Considering that the movie's real time is about 20+ hours but the movie is 2.5 hrs long lots of themes are unnecessary.","true":true}
