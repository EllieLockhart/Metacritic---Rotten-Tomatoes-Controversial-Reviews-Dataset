Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched this on Blu-ray and oh boy\\, it gets worse with each viewing. I get that it's 2018 and people are SOOO politically correct these days but when you sacrifice good story telling for the sake of SJWs\\, you end up with the 47% score that you see here. \\n\\nTho i have to give massive credit to the team of animators\\, composers who did a brilliant job to make TLJ look and sound visually amazing. \\n\\nBut ulitmately\\, I think RJ and KK just single handedly (watch the behind the scenes features and you'll see how RJ wants things to be done HIS way and HIS way only) destroyed this new Star Wars trilogy and I can only hope that JJ Abrams can salvage this \\\"SJW\\\" bullshit somehow.","true":true}
