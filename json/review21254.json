Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in the theater after my brother told me it was good \\, however I thought it was terrible and left the theater after the holdo hyperjump. I wanted my brother to give me money back based on how bad my experience was but he didn't ( it was worth a try) and told how the film ended which made me dislike it more when he was trying to convince me. I never paying for another one of these films.","true":true}
