Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was barely entertaining. Not quite a snoozefest as you want to watch the train crash. It's really too bad to see a metaphorical castration of Luke on screen. His impotency and subsequent departure is\\, however\\, very fitting for the direction this film wanted to portray. Kylo Ren was the best part of this film. I like his character\\, and is the only one really who showed much emotion\\, and depth. Graphics were solid. Sound was excellent. Just didn't do much to redeem the film as a whole though. If you were looking for answers which were asked in EP7\\, be prepared to get only a few\\, methodical explanations. There's no more mystery in the SW universe. It's fitting that most of this film took place is space\\, as the film is just as empty.","true":true}
