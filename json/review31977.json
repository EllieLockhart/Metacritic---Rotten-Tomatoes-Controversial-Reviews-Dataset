Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**Spoilers ahead***\\n\\nHaving watched the premiere of the latest installment of the new Star Wars trilogy\\, this movie has incredible conflicting tones. The Last Jedi is a beautifully crafted film with amazing music and incredible set pieces\\, held back only by what appears to be poor plot choices and very strange pacing. The Finn\/Rose subplot is one of the most boring and unnecessary storylines I have ever witnessed in a Star Wars franchise\\, it can literally be completely cut from the movie and it would make no difference to the overall story at all.\\nThe actors themselves are really good however\\, Hamill is again amazing as Luke Skywalker. Daisy Ridley is equally great as Rey\\, while the late Carrie Fisher deserves every piece of credit for an amazing performance as princess Leia once again.","true":true}
