Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't care what anyone says\\, this a great movie. The relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren is what really drove this movie for me. Also\\, despite what people say I enjoyed Luke in this movie. The only people who truly hate this movie are the over obsessed Star Wars fanboys who want everything to stay the same and get the super obvious reveals like if Luke was Rey's father. Too bad.","true":true}
