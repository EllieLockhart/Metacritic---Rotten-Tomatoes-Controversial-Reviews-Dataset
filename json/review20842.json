Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to start out by saying I\u2019m not a die hard Star Wars fan. I don\u2019t know the canon\\, and I don\u2019t care if they change the Star Wars universe. What I do care about is a good story. With that being said\\, I won\u2019t give away any spoilers. I\u2019ll just say that the movie was a disappointment. I went in with no expectations\\, and left with a huge \u201cmeh\u201d. The first half of the movie felt campy\\, and the second half felt rushed. I left with the distinct impression that Disney just sort of popped this one out\\, without much care to it. I regret to say that this is best left to video.","true":true}
