Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Worst Episode in the Franchise hands down. I don\u2019t know how others even thought this movie was even decent. I honestly couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the theater\\, which is sad since I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fan. I will never watch this episode again\\, and i even sat TFA twice and bought the Blu-ray. Thanks Disney!","true":true}
