Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before I went into the movie\\, I saw that it was above 90 % on RT and they were saying how it's the best since Empire (Which is an insane thing for them to say regardless) So when I went in I was thinking it was going to be epic. Then the film started with a marvel joke\\, but I was like\\, \\\"It's okay\\, this movie will pick up...\\\" Then space Leia and I was like\\, \\\"That was odd\\, oh well\\, things will pick up...\\\" Then Luke tosses the light saber and i'm like\\, \\\"Again! when is this going to get good?\\\" Then the slow speed chase that reminded me of OJ Simpson for some reason\\, and i was like\\, \\\"What the hell\\, oh\\, wait\\, 90% RT score\\, it must be one epic ending with Luke kicking ass...\\\" Nope\\, he ended up fading away much like the Star Wars franchise. I left the movies feeling empty and not really pump for the next film. As the days went by I tried to like this film\\, but the more I thought about it\\, the more I failed. It's all SJW! Rey is good at everything\\, The bad guys are goofy and not scary\\, and what is there for the next film? Yet the critics love this film? Did they watch this film in a Parallel universe?","true":true}
