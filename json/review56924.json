Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars prequels have an amazing story\\, with terrible execution\\, and so far the sequels have amazing execution\\, with terrible story.  The story is so bad now I have doubts I'll see the next Star Wars movie in theatres.  George Lucas is a master storyteller and his absence from these stories has been deeply felt.  Despite the polished CGI\\, acting and dialogue I can't help but feel Disney doesn't understand that to make a great star wars movie you can't just rehash elements of the original trilogy (minimizing their importance in doing so) and feed the audience cheap fan service moments. We've been seeing rehashes of the original trilogy since it defined the science-fantasy genre!  \\n\\nStorywise\\, it's too late for this trilogy now but assuming Disney continues to make pseudo-annual $tar War$ movies\\, I hope they can come up with something fresh.  There's lots of great ideas in the Star Wars expanded universe.  Perhaps adapt the KOTOR story for some movies.  That game's cutscenes with their crappy character models told a more compelling story than this batch of Disney $tar War$ Bantha fodder.\\n\\nBut look at the box office numbers....they can probably exploit our nostalgia forever.   #TooStarWarsToFail","true":true}
