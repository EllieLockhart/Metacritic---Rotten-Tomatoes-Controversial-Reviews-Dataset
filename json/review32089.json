Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\nSPOILERS\\nSPOILERS\\nSPOILERS!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuke died a unhappy virgin who tried to kill his 2 best friends son(kylo ren) while he was still a child. Rey is powerful because we have a SJW agenda to push. I mean who needs training right?! Girl power!!! Leia can fly through space like superman\\, fuck that's sexist. I mean superwoman! Oh and Snoke the big baddy from TFA that everyone drew theories for was never explained. He just gets killed by kylo since kylo wants sweet sweet rey booty. Overall shit movie that had no idea where it wanted to take this but it tried. Enjoy you .5 rating micky mouse","true":true}
