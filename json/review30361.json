Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seemed very poorly written with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Entire side quests that have no pay off. Additionally\\, the actions of characters made were completely illogical. Not worth seeing.","true":true}
