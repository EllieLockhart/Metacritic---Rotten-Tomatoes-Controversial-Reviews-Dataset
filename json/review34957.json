Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film moved slow at several points. \\n\\nThere were a couple scenes where I rolled my eyes and muttered to myself\\, \\\"This ain't Star Wars.\\\" Also\\, there was a scene where I thought of \\\"Return of the Jedi\\,\\\" and muttered\\, \\\"Are we doing this again? Really?\\\" \\n\\nThe fight scenes and space battles were good.  But overall\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a C movie that gets a B-minus at absolute best if we're grading on a curve.","true":true}
