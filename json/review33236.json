Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such incredible potential that was absolutely squandered by the director!!  The ONLY category this movie did well in was in visual effects.  Truly bad storytelling!!  just wow","true":true}
