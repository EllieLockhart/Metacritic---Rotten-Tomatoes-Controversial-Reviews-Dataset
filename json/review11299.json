Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly up there with Episodes V and VI. I thought Force Awakens was far too slavish in its worship of the original trilogy. The Last Jedi demolishes much of the nostalgic trappings that have hampered Star Wars since Luke and Vader first showed up. If you want an adult's version of Star Wars where the good guys don't always win\\, things don't always work out\\, and grizzled veterans can finally make peace with their past\\, this is the movie for you.","true":true}
