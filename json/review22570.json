Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lifelong Star Wars fan\\, and I genuinely enjoyed The Last Jedi! There are a few nit picky issues I have\\, but overall the story was awesome. It had me thinking back on previous movies including the Clone Wars animated series. I left feeling ready for episode 9. It made me nostalgic and ready for the future all at once. My advice\\, go in without any set ideas on how you believe it should go\\, sit back\\, and enjoy.","true":true}
