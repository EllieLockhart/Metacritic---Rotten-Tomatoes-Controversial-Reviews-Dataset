Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here Lies the Body of Star Wars  \\n1977 - 2017\\n\\nDied aged 40.\\nHacked to Death by Professional Hack\\, Rian Johnson.\\n\\nRIP\\, Forever in Our Hearts.\\n\\n\\\"The Dream That Began in 1977 is Over.\\\"","true":true}
