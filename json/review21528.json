Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would really give it 4 stars\\, but this movie is getting too much hate for stupid reasons. Star Wars \u00e2??fans\u00e2?? only like two movies. Those are \u00e2??a new hope\u00e2??\\, and \u00e2??empire strikes back\u00e2??. They hate everything else. You can\u00e2??t please these people at all. This movie was fun\\, exciting\\, sad\\, and unpredictable. Great combination to have for a Sci-if movie. Definitely will go see it again!","true":true}
