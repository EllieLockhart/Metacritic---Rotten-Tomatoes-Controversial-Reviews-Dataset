{"101487":184165,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie in my opinion is a disappointment on so many levels. The Director straight up trolls the force awakens and destroys any story that movie had potential. Finn & Rose's story is garbage and had no point. Luke's Character was thrown away and a shame. (ask Mark Hamil if he liked the direction of this movie took)  The Rebels have like what 20 people left in the resistance? Oh they have the Kid who moved the Broom lets wait 15 years for him to grown up. Humor was out of place and missed a lot. Phasma had no impact (again) why not put some scenes of her actually taking the rebels out so you can be more into her character.  RIP Snoke\\, what a waste of a character\\, no backstory for him at all\\, how is he so powerful?  Hummmm... Is DJ anyones favorite Star Wars character now?  LOL (i'm sure you'll have to look up who that actually is will prove was pointless he was to this story)   Rey's Parents are nobody so how is she so powerful? And why didn't Leia take over that ship that went into lightspeed and go out like a boss instead of Purple Hair Lady who we didn't care about. Missed Opportunity again. So many Unanswered Questions or closed storylines done in a poor manner.   I honestly wanted to love this movie but the more I think about what it could have been is depressing.  The Last Jedi is a bold movie i'll give it that but honestly for the wrong reasons and I would think would be the majority of Star wars fans who love the lore and history will agree it took a giant step backward.","true":true}
