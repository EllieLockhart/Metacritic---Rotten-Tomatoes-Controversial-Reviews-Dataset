But this game single handily ruined the last of us franchise and spat on the gamers who loved the first one so much. We had to see Joel who was the main character we were all so emotionally invested in get beaten to death in the first 2 hours of the game and then play half of the game with the testosterone boosted Abby who killed him. This game tried way too hard to focus on female empowerment instead of giving the community what we wanted and that was a masterpiece like the first Last of Us game where the story telling was based on a strong \\, caring Joel and his growing relationship with this girl Ellie who he was meant to smuggle across the country to save the world but instead saves her when he realizes that the fireflies were going to kill her.
