Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was definitely my least favorite Star Wars movie.  (Pseudo spoilers follow) Unfortunately\\, the plot was weak\\, full of holes and litered with social agenda that I can watch any evening on the news.  Entire branches of the plot could be removed and it wouldn't make a difference by the end of the movie.  Then there was the fact that the many of the characters that solidified the franchise were flung aside without regard which was just disgraceful.  Even new characters to this trilogy lack backstory\\, meaning\\, and purpose.  Some people are saying the directors went in a brave new direction with this film\\, but I say they lost their way.","true":true}
