Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall it was solid. I could have done without the slapstick humor\\, Finn's side story\\, and a couple scenes with some frog nuns that made me question my own sobriety. There's also a very fine line for a director to walk when punctuating dramatic moments with comedy; sometimes it works in the Last Jedi and sometimes it doesn't. All of this is more than made up for with a relatively compelling story for the main protagonist\/antagonist\\, a couple of interesting twists near the end\\, and the most badass light saber battle in a Star Wars film to date.","true":true}
