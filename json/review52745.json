{"101487":101308,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost as bad as Phantom Menace. The scene with Snoke and Rey is to like the scene in Return of the jedi\\, with the emperor\\, luke and vader. The plot was all wrong. Rian just gave a \\\"big fuck you\\\" to the 7th\\, which created a good start for rey\\, snoke etc. I laughed only one time\\, all other jokes were shit. All other jokes were out of place etc. They almost like forced themselves to give the jokes. Just a bad fkn movie. I like finn but his and rose journey was shit and so fkn unnecessary. It felt like a fkn kid disney movie. The company felt like fuck yaa more toys to do with new characters from finns and rose journey. Fkn hell.","true":true}
