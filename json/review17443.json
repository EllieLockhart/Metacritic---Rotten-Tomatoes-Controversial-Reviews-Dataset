Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this in theaters and have to say that I was horribly disappointed. The Force Awakens was a three star movie\\, nothing special - but I was hoping that it was just the framing device they were going to use to explain all of the stuff they set up in the next installment. I was wrong.\\n\\nRey is good at everything no matter what and has had to sacrifice absolutely nothing in order to gain power (this is not how you write protagonists) and the \\\"rebels\/resistance\\\" are about as effective as a bowl of Jel-O.\\n\\nSomewhere along the way someone said \\\"its good because it subverts expectations\\,\\\" all I can say is that when I go out for Chinese Food and someone brings me Chicken Parmesan\\, my expectations have been subverted. These are supposed to be DIRECT SEQUELS to the original trilogy - not \\\"watch us kill everyone old off so we can push our marketing strategies with skin.\\\"\\n\\nI am all for women. I like women. I really do. But when you ham-fist in these characters who have no motivation\\, no reason to be\\, and no direction and call them \\\"strong\\\" I have to wonder if the writers KNOW what strength actually looks like. \\n\\nThe cute funny jokes and not taking things seriously in serious moments and all of that is not the Star Wars tone - this is not Parks and Recreation with Lightsabers. It just isn't. Or maybe it is. God knows that the continuity is about on par.","true":true}
