Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is certain to \\\"work\\\" for anyone not familiar with or fond of the Lucas Films series. However\\, it is far too Disney-like for those of us who value the depth of character\\, mirth\\, and flair that used to be the hallmark of the original cinematic Star Wars films. That is to say\\, that this film will serve you well if all that you care about is the in-the-moment feel of a film. While I certainly applaud many of actors' performances and the general coherence of the main plot\\, there are so many aspects of this film that are\\, well\\, simply uninspiring and bizarre. For example\\, it's pretty apparent that only Rey's character is truly valued. All others\\, whether old or new\\, seem to be just \\\"random\\\" waypoints along Rey's bizarre telepathic trajectory. The roles of Poe\\, Fin\\, Leia\\, Luke\\, and Maz Kanata are truly alien to anyone who was impressed with their prior roles -- not to mention how hollow the roles of General Hux and Supreme Leader Snoke are. And why is the CGI for Snokes throne room\\, the First Order ships\\, and Max Kanata so bland and blurry? Thus count me in as yet another disappointed Star Wars \\\"kid\\\"\\, who grew up watching all of the George Lucas classics in their heyday.","true":true}
