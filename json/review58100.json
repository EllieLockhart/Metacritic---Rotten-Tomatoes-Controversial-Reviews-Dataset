Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars moie ever made. All of JJ Abrahams work tossed out the window. Ruining of Luke Skywalker's character. Ruining of Rey's parentage. Killing off of Snoke without revealing any of his story. Destruction of the Franchise in general\\, how the hell could Rian Johnson think destroying Luke Skywalker's character to be a good thing.","true":true}
