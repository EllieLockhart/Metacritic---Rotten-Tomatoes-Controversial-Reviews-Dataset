Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though I do agree with many of the critiques\\, I do believe that this movie is worth so much more than a 57%. It has great humor\\, amazing fighting sequences\\, interesting character development\\, and unforgettable plot-twists. Sure\\, there are some unnecessary scenes and some weird characters *cough*cough*porgs*cough* but it was an enjoyable movie. I was on the edge of my seat. It's worth the watch. Mark gives an astounding performance and Carrie Fisher is a living legend in this movie. If for any other reason to see this movie\\, go because of Carrie and Mark.","true":true}
