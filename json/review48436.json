Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without a doubt\\, this was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. Don't believe the defenders. Everything that was set up in the Force Awakens is thrown out the window for the sake of subverting expectations. Luke is made to be a joke. The Canto Bight sequence was complete garbage and Rey is a legitimate Mary Sue. 1 year on and I am still mad about how poorly this movie turned out.","true":true}
