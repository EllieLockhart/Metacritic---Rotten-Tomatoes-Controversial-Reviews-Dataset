Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really loved this movie. Had a good plot to it and just loved how it played out. Lots of action sequences. I don\u2019t know why people are hating on the movie. I enjoyed it. ","true":true}
