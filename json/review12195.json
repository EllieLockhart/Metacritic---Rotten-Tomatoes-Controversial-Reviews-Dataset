Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a strong Star Wars fan and have been since the original movie. One of the problems I have with the latest movie is that if you know nothing of the previous movies\\, it won't make sense. It relies so heavily on knowledge of previous movies that it doesn't stand on its own very well. Overall I enjoyed the movie\\, even thru the slow parts. Not sure exactly why they had to drag some things out so much\\, but I did enjoy the movie.","true":true}
