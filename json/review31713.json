Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So sick and tired of all this SJW bullcrap\\, It's WAY to obvious and horrible. And for what purpose? This is the worst Star wars Movie so far\\, and I used to agree with the masses that 1-3 (the prequels) were utter s...t\\, But at least they were only awful\\, and not extremely filled with political bs\/sjw mentality and other ridiculous plots and all. Gawd\\, this is the only movie in my entire life where I didn't mind that it was ending soon\\, or where I actually hoped for it to end sooner then it did. But because I love Star wars from childhood\\, I just simply had to watch until the end... \\n\\nLeft the cinema with a very disappointed feel.","true":true}
