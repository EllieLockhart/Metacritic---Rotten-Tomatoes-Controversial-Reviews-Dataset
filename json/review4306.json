Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can be summed up by the moment an experienced military leader who has been fighting in guerrilla wars since she was a teenager explaining a military plan to what we are told is the best combat pilot in the galaxy using the words \\\"Big Ship\\\". \\nPuerile garbage with no respect for an audience which thinks a complete lack of cohesion and internal consistency qualifies as a twist.","true":true}
