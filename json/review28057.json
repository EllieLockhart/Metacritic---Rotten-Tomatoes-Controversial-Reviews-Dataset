Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"plot holes\\, stupid instant love story\\, snokes pointless death\\, rae is instantly a jedi\\, so many more reasons why this was terrible.  i do love all the critics with there 93% rating.  how about you guys grow a pair","true":true}
