Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The continuation of Disney ruining the franchise. Luke's character was missed used and wasted. George\\, hope the 4 billion was worth ruining your franchise!","true":true}
