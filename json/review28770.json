Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly one of the worst written films of all time. Writer\/Director Rian Johnson wanted the characters and set pieces all to be in specific places and didn't care about getting them into those places. Humour which destroys the tension of the entire scene and an absolute focus on being unpredictable no matter the damage to the story and world as a whole. Someone at LucasFilm in future desperately needs to make sure there is an overarching plan in place if they do more trilogies and make sure the director does not have absolute control over the script.","true":true}
