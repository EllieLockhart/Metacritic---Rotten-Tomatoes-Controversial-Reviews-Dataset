Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never posted a review on Rotten Tomatoes or felt the need to create an account to do so until viewing this movie.  I feel like even George Lucas would be rolling over in the grave we all wish he was in after Phantom Menace.  Kudos to the special effects people in this movie and the decent character development of Kylo Ren...that is where my positive feelings end. Outside of the terrible story line which ends up being a worse chase in space than even the Speed series could have produced\\, the forced arch type Luke's character is pushed into could only be explained by the type of \\\"Force\\\" only a large evil corporation could exert. \\n Just to be clear I mean Disney and not the First order.  I can understand how the two can sometimes seem indistinguishable.  Lastly\\, he movie also adds to the feeling of being in outer-space by offering so many plot holes it bends the space time continuum itself.  The result is a black hole that slows time to a crawl while you wonder what happened to the $15 you just spent on a ticket.","true":true}
