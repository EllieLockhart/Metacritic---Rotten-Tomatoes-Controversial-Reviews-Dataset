Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few flaws here and there\\, it's not perfect. But I enjoyed the crap out of this. I mean... I loved it. So many twists\\, nothing went as I thought it would\\, and I love it when such a major story with so much speculation swirling around it can surprise and buck the expected narrative. I could have done without some side plots\\, a few new characters here and there\\, but it's basically a 9\/10 despite that\\, for me. Good laughs\\, however uncharacteristic of the franchise thus far they were in nature\\, but it largely was serious when it needed to be. I have some questions\\, and I feel like there may be some inconsistencies\\, but I'm hoping they'll be made more clear in the next film. Loved it!","true":true}
