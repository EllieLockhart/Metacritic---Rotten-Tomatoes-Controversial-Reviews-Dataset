Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I realized that I was being too hard on this movie. I was judging it based off of my expectations instead of what it actually was. And for that\\, I raise my rating an entire one star. I won't say much\\, but I realized that I did enjoy this movie and have seen what Rian Johnson envisioned. I love parts of it\\, but other parts are bad (Canto Bight). I have nothing to say that you haven't already heard. I liked the movie overall\\, but parts of it were bad.","true":true}
