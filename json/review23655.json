Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love the twists. People are interpreting them too narrowly. Snoke will be back\\, as will Luke. Both are powerful beyond physical form. \\n\\nBrilliant job overall\\, Rian. Cut Rose\/Finn tedious plot and it's almost in Empire's rarified air.","true":true}
