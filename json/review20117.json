Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IT WASN'T A BAD MOVIE. Yes they did some things I really didn't like and it didn't really feel like a star wars movie. It was a solid movie in itself but just not a solid starwars movie. They really screwed us over in parts but it is still a good movie","true":true}
