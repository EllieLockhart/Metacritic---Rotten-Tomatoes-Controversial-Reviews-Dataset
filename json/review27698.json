Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are being hypercritical because they did not get the nostalgia experience as they did with The Force Awakens and to a lesser extent Rogue One. JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson were given the same box of toys. JJ did what he pretty much always does: go for the nostalgia....and he did it really really well and should be praised for it.  Johnson\\, however\\, took these same toys that he loved and made a film that deals with universal themes: loss\\, regret\\, guilt\\, the value of failure\\, learning from mistakes....only Empire has come close to this level of screenwriting\\, and through only the Luke and Yoda story.  Rian Johnson has made a Star Wars film that is better at being a film. It also is better at being Star Wars insofar that it redefines what Star Wars is\\, or at least teaches us the value of not rigidly defining what is Star Wars and what isn't.","true":true}
