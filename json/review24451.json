Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More plot holes than actual plot in the movie\\, no character development and overall just a bland movie. It seemed like they tried their best to fit in a diverse cast and then strung a bunch of random action sequences together and threw cgi on it to try and make it look pretty. Didn't even feel like a star wars movie which was pretty much the only reason I went to see it in the first place.","true":true}
