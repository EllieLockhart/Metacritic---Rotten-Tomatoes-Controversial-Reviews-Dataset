Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up watching Star Wars after being introduced to it by my dad\\, Luke was a childhood hero of mine. This movie destroyed that\\, this among other reasons has left me completely uninterested in watching episode 9\\, or any stand alone. God help the Obi-Wan trilogy...\\n\\nThe good: visually impressive\\, and John Williams score was fantastic as always\\n\\nThe bad: jeez... Where do I start?\\n\\nThe pacing: It reached a point where I was looking at my watch to see how long was left. I was initially excited for a 2.5 hour Star Wars film\\, that changed\\, I was uninterested and disengaged.\\n\\nThey mishandled Luke\\, and the Force. Everyone else has said it.\\n\\nHoldo was unnecessary\\, her role should have been given to Admiral Ackbar.\\n\\nSpace Leia...\\n\\nThe SJW\\, PC subplot that was Canto Bight\\, and Rose deeming the mission a success because they freed some space horses that will literally be recaptured in a week.\\n\\nRey's nobody parents culminating in her almost mastery of the force.\\n\\nI've never felt the need to review a movie before. The Last Jedi got so many things wrong that I'm still angry about it a week after seeing it and I felt the need to put it in writing.","true":true}
