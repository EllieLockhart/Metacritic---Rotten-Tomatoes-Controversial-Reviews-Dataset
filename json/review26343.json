Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I expected\\, but so much better actually.  So many people are going to moan and complain and whine about it not happening like they thought in their own minds\\, but this was just great.  I can't wait until Episode 9 man\\, and kinda wish Rian would just finish the series off\\, but J.J....your up\\, for now!","true":true}
