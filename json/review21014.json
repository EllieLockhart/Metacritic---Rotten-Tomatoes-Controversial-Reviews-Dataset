Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't planning on seeing this in the theaters after all the negative vibes i received from others who did see it\\, I'm glad I changed my mind. Was it as bad as everyone said? Absolutely not. Was it as good as I had hoped? Not at all.At the very least it was an original story\\, which was my biggest complaint with \\\"Force Awakens\\\" Should you see it on the big screen? Sure although you could wait until it lands in a cinema pub or discount theater( so long as no one you know will spoil it for you)","true":true}
