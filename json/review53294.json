Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Computer says no.. This movie just spat in the face of the known SW canon and especially of Luke's importance and character. He was able to turn Darth Vader to the light side of the force who is recognized as the most powerful Jedi\\, yet he had a complete nervous breakdown when his grandson had darkside inclinations.. The conversion of Kylo should have been a walk in the park for Luke\\, Dont get me started on Mary Sue! I mean Rei's all powerful\\, all knowing\\, never in danger with no flaws character who is seemingly able to use the force without any training whatsoever.. Why not send out a squadron of Tie bombers to blow the resistance to hell instead of the slowest chase scene ever? This movie was stupid on so many levels..","true":true}
