Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw The Last Jedi opening night and it didn't disappoint. I don't think it's as good as Empire Strikes Back\\, but it's up there-- high up there-- in terms of being one of the best Star Wars movies yet. It's a film that almost can't be reviewed without revealing spoilers\\, so apologies for the lack of specifics. See it you must\\, enjoy it you will.","true":true}
