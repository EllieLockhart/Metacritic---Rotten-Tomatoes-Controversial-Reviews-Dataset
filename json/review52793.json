Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Along with its weak plot points\\, TLJ gives too many reminders of the world we are living in with white men in control of buttons and war and blah blah blah...Its Star Wars\\, give me aliens and fun not feminism .I live in this shitty world i dont need to be reminded of it watching a film about space aliens. Way too much reality for me. \\nAnd if your game is to introduce ideas and theories that influence its viewers to care about its importance and then shove them aside with no explanation...then you have lost my money for episode 9.","true":true}
