Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked in to the theatre expecting to see star wars. I left with an odd amount of slapstick comedy\\, 2 1\/2 hours but still no character progression\\, and effects that mirror a children's super hero movie. As I walked out of the theatre I overheard a woman say \\\"well that was unnecessary\\\". About sums it up. Big fat rotten tomato this one.","true":true}
