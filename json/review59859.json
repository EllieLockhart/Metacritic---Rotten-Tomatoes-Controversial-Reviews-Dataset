We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Just Ended! It is Masterpiece!Im from Russia\\, so sorry me for my English\\, im only listen and read English\\, never talk or write. And i never wrote on this site and never rate this.All game\\, every part it is something that everybody who loves game industry should try. All part of this game is Masterpiece\\, and only part which is debatable it is story. For me story work great. I have opinion that LGBT theme is redundant\\, but im waiting more propaganda about it\\, but in game it almost doesn't matter. Story great take us to the revenge theme\\, then show us other side of conflict which after Ellie path looks more like HUMAN being\\, then push it together in conflict. And all it by master storytelling. Moment when main character fighting im wanted to throw game pad away just for stop this\\, i even trying to miss QTE. I cant explain all my feeling in english\\, but its have so many moment when i have thinking about this game\\, about revenge\\, friends\\, enemies\\, life at all. I think this is great story with great directing.And if somebody dont like story\\, its really mean 0 as rate this game? all this animation\\, locations\\, sounds\\, gameplay\\, voice acting doesnt mean nothing? im so confusing by all this hate. I can understand rate 5-6\\, okay 4\\, but lower its insane for me.Often people hear talk about part I\\, im a big fan of TLOU part I\\, this is first game that affect on my by so special way. And for me story at first game more simple\\, more \\\"one-sided\\\"\\, and more \\\"straightforward\\\". So im also cant understand people who talk about first story like it something unique\\, but this is poor **** whats wrong with you? What are you waiting? New journey Ellie and Joel? for this play part I\\, this is new experience in this awesome universe.While Im playing i was not 100% deal with story\\, and fell some disappoint too\\, but after end scene and little time with thoughts about it im understand that story is such as it should be.10\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
