Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as some of the die hards suggested.  I actually liked the arc or the plot for Luke and Leia.  Lots of fluff for the younger\/newer Star Wars fans.  Only real complaint was that there were some obvious USC film school moments where the dialogue explained the action - instead of just doing it!  I think Kylo Ren won a lot of bad guy points in this one and really outshines the horrible pre-qual Annakin Skywalker super weenie stuff.  Go see it!","true":true}
