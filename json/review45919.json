Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visual effects are good\\, the story is a massive underwhelming disappointment. So terrible I regretted the time wasted on it more than the money. ALso the top critics obviously are not trustworthy in their opinions. Nobody who has a basic understanding of what a good plot is would give this movie a rating above average.","true":true}
