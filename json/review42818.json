Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not Star Wars. If there was an option to give it zero stars\\, I would. I think that Rian Johnson tried to make this movie more like a Marvel movie by adding all of that humor but it doesn't work in Star Wars like it does in Marvel movies. They also ruined Luke's character by making super whiny and just not like he was in the original movies. Luke was meant to be a wise Jedi Master NOT an unreasonable uncle who tried to kill his nephew in his sleep. There were also so many unanswered questions in this movie. I get that Rian Johnson tried to make Star Wars different but as the saying goes \\\"if it ain't broke don't fix it.\\\"","true":true}
