Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was an epic fail.  The parts that I liked were vastly outweighed by the parts I hated.  \\n\\nThe good: \\n* Music and visuals\\n* Performances by Luke\\, Leia\\, Ren\\, Rey\\, Finn an Poe\\n* Snoke chamber room scene\\n* Porgs - I actually found them cute\\n\\nThe piss poor:\\n* Rose\\, OMG Rose....she was AWFUL!!\\n* Luke does not act like Luke at all\\n* Leia is too stiff and it's probably because even she knew how ridiculous her flying scene was\\n* No explanation of who Snoke is\/was\\n* Yoda burning ancient books reminded me of ISIS or Nazis\\n* The Marvelesque humor\\n* Not enough Chewie\\, R2 and C3PO\\n* Rey is a no one\\n* Bombs falling in space\\n* SJW\\, SJW and more SJW \\n\\nSave your money if you haven't already scene this mess.  I will not go to see Solo (no one can replace Harrison Ford and I'm not interested in seeing the attempt)\\, and out of spite for the massive disappointment I'm still feeling\\, I refuse to see episode 9 when it comes out.","true":true}
