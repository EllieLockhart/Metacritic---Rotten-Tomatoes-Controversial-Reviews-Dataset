Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't let the blind hatred this movie is getting for some scenes fool you\\, this is spectacular and amazing movie\\, well shot\\, well directed and with a fantastic story. It subverts audience expectations in an extraordinary way while contributing to the STAR WARS mythos and honoring the saga's past (as is expected of the 8th film of a story).\\n\\nRight now\\, it seems you have 2 options: either you make movies that play it safe when it comes to STAR WARS (like Rogue One and TFA)\\, or you make an original film that still honors the things that came before (which is what Star Wars the last jedi is).\\n\\nIf you're expecting a by-the-books STAR WARS movie you won't find it here\\, what you will find is something that will be controversial to a tee\\, but if you embrace it will destroy your expectations about where the story is going.\\n\\nPS: Your theories suck.","true":true}
