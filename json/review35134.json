Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens took me back to my 11-year-old self\\, watching A New Hope in my hometown's one-sceen theater and thinking it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen.  The Last Jedi made me remember that theater is now a parking lot for an abandoned Wal-Mart.","true":true}
