Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked this one even more than a force awakens. I think it's a great continuation in this trilogy set. I definitely was let down on some aspects of the story (spoiler: the fact that they let me down on Rey's parents and Snoke's backstory\\, kinda made me sad). But still\\, I see Rian's vision and I am good with it. Overall a great main story line. Liked it enough that I will see it once more in the theater and will pre order the blu-ray. ","true":true}
