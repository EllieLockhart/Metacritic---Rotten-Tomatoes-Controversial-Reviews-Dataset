Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why people are having such a bad reaction to this movie. Its got great laughs\\, amazing fight scenes\\, and a lot of heartwarming bits and pieces that make it better. I loved every second of this movie\\, regardless of how it made me sob.","true":true}
