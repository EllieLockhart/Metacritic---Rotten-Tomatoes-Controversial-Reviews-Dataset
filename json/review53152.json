Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful.  Try making a movie that appeals to your fanbase.  Rian Johnson ruined this film.  Very little continuity from the previous film.  Highly inappropriate \\\"humor\\\" moments. JJ Abrams did a pretty good job setting this film up for a great story to be told (Why is Luke hiding\\, who is Rey\\, what's up with Snoke\\, the Knights of Ren\\, etc.).  It's unbelievable how the director could completely disregard everything and make this flop.  There were some nice visuals\\, but that's pretty much to be expected with a movie of this franchise.  I've been watching Star Wars movies for about 35 years.  You guys totally lost me on this stinking pile of putrescence.","true":true}
