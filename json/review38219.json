Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visual effects are bomb\\, and the acting was a great improvement over the childishness of the previous installment\\, however this is very much a Disney Star Wars movie and not a true Star Wars movie. There is nothing to see here\\, it is simply a space opera.","true":true}
