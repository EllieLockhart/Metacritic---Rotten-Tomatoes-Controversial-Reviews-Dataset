{"101487":169382,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\nI would like to start out by saying\\, I am not a die hard Star Wars fan\\, and I did not think this movie was the worst thing I have ever seen.  For one thing\\, the technical aspects of the  movie's visuals were extraordinary.  What really made me create and post a comment is the fact that critics have given this movie an outrageously high review\\, despite the movies plot that is less rock solid than Pacific Rim. (I liked Pacific Rim\\, and I use this as an example to show how easy going I am when it comes to a movie being cool over having a comprehensive storyline and characters) The Last Jedi\\, as you can tell from every other comment\\, is filled with so many plot holes that it is astounding that a movie of such prestige and of immense wealth could create such garbage. I decided to make this comment section to summarize the plot holes and things that just leave you scratching your head. I won't be saying anything about  how I miss old developed characters because like I said before I am not a die hard Star Wars fan. Also\\, if you have seen the movie it will make a lot more sense\\, because sometimes its hard to right down exactly what I am saying. I don't know everyones name either.\\n\\n1\\, Leia dies and float backs through outer space\\, and lives. You can say this is because of the force but it really makes no sense\\, and many people thought it was comical.\\n2. When Leia initially died\\, and the next chick took over why did she not disclose the aspects of her escape plan to Poe. This leads to Poe trying to take matters into his own hands which leads to several problems later on.\\n3. The side quest Poe is able to mastermind with Flynn and Rose has no impact on the actual storyline. It is an hour side quest that has no agenda\\, but to push certain political and social issues like Casinos\\, Weapon Dealing\\, Poverty\\, and animal cruelty.  \\n4. Rose is not a likable character in any regard\\, but some of her bizarre actions add to my dislike of her.  Notably she saves Flynn from saving everyone else\\, for a chance to kiss him? Also when they are entering that final battle against the giant cannon\\, Rose is one of the 12 most qualified fighers the rebellion has even though the movie shows tons of rebells still left fighting in the trenches behind them.\\n5. Rey is just instantly a better Jedi than Kylo\\, which makes zero sense because he trained with Luke then with Snoke. Furthermore\\, she is able to best Kylo in the force at one point\\, and move a shit ton of rocks\\, all without any training at all.  Also her parents are not from a prestigious background\\, which I like the concept that anyone can be a Jedi\\, but in this scenario you also don't have to work for anything.  Anyone can\\, with no experience\\, be a better Jedi than Kylo \\n6. Kylo is a terrible villain\\, one thing that made the original trilogy so great was the ultra powerful villain of Vader. Kylo can't even beat someone who has zero training in fighting\\, how am I supposed to fear him?\\n7. Where is the first order getting all their wealth and power? When force awakens ended there was a huge victory for the rebels something that would logically have some swing of power into rebels hands.  Instead the first order is back with giant ass ships\\, and the rebels are back with smaller ships.\\n8. The main story of the ship being chased is built on the idea that the first order ships can't catch up to the rebels ship\\, despite being able to go the speed of light\\, and being built by same manufactures. (Something confirmed by Rose and Fin plot)\\n9. Benecio del Toro\\, was just sitting in jail\\, even though he could have broken out at any moment.\\n10. BB8 is unbelievable at fighting. Why did he have so many coins? He could have funded his own rebel fleet. Also towards the end he starts tearing apart the inside of the ship and saves Rose and Fin even though before he was noticed instantly walking around in a disguise.\\n11. Humor was misplaced and not funny.\\n12. Storm trooper lady and Snoke are underdeveloped and both die\\, making me wonder who they were? Why we cared about them? and if JJ Abrams and Rain Johnson talked once. \\n13. They destroy the first order mother ship by traveling light speed.  This means the rebels could have sacrificed one fo their ships every time the first order built some crazy super weapon. For example\\, the death start could have been destroyed by ramming a ship at light speed in the center of it.  In this movie the rebels could have launched one of their ships into snokes ship instead of just waiting for every ship to run out of fuel. Ships should be ruining into shit all them time. \\n14. Wtf yoda?\\n15. Luke Skywalker is underdeveloped and his reason for joining is stupid.  R2D2 still has power. The Jedi's ability to transfer matter makes zero sense.  Earlier when Rey does that with Kylo\\, Kylo is literally touching water.  When Luke does it he is able to give Leia golden Die\\, but when Kylo puts a lightsaber through Luke that is when they can't exchange matter? \\n16. One bomber takes out dreadnought\\, and have the bombers are destroyed by a domino effect which you think after decades of fighting would be something the rebels would understand.  Don't put your ships right next to each other\\, cause one will destroy all of them. \\n18. There is a bunch of dropped shit from the force awakens\\, for example the henchmen with Kylo are revealed to be other Jedi students under Luke\\, but that is it. \\n19. Luke is cranky old man\\, who reveals he never wanted to be found.  He goes to planet that has map to it\\, so that when the time comes he can be found.  That time comes and he is pissed about being found? \\n20. Chewy serves no point in movie.\\n\\nIm sure I could keep going but these are main ones.  Sorry for any grammar or name mistakes I wrote this pretty fast.","true":true}
