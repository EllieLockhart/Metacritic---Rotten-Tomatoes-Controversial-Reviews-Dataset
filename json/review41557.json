Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is exceptional with some of the best dialogue\\, action scenes\\, and emotion in the entire series. I get why people left the theatre with mixed emotions\\, but to those people I would say embrace what is new. People have been so hung up over fan theories for the past two years that they can\u2019t appreciate what has been done here. This move is amazing\\, do not let the reddit trolls let you think otherwise. ","true":true}
