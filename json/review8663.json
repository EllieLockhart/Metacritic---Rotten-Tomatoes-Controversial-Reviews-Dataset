{"101487":121467,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First watch 3\/5. Second watch 4\/5. All the \u201cbad\u201d parts kinda dilute the good\/amazing parts. Second watch is recomendable as you can ignore the bad aspects of this movie and enjoy the good parts more","true":true}
