Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found that many people's comments being about how it seemed that the movie subverted expectations didn't truly get what the movie was about.  It was about subverting expectations and letting go of the past to move on. It has it's flaws\\, but ultimately I think it was a solid movie and something new to the Star Wars series.","true":true}
