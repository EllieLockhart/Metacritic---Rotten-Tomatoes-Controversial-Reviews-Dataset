Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst of all Star Wars movies! Even Episode 1 is better. Was ready to walk out. Will not see the movie a second time\\, keep your Dvd and Blurays Disney. You have no idea what Star Wars is or I should say\\, was. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher didn't deserve such a lousy script. Characters ruined forever. I want George Lucas back! Screw you Disney for ruining the best Saga in history. Now that everybody is killed off no need to see another movie. Rogue one outperformed TFA and this movie  by far.","true":true}
