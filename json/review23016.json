Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of unlogical plot holes\\, irracional decisions and honestly bs political agenda\\, too much jokes\\, changing characters big time (which is not a terrible thing\\, but given that they changed so much for just the sake of changing it and surprising the audience) - when you develop story and characters\\, it is not just about doing it but about doing it RIGHT. Of course\\, humour was better than in phantom menace or attack of the clones\\, but again\\, the story and character development was imo very poor. It was emotional rollercoaster of and experience - in a pattern like this: suspense - dissapointment - expectations - dissapointment and this is not how you do an emotional rollercoaster in movies. I just find this movie really annoying and no\\, second watching did not help for me as it just has to be good on first viewing. 45% for me.","true":true}
