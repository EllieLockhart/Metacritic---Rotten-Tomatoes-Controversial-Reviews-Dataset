Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the product of bad management. Lucas\\, being the creator\\, owner\\, and singular man in charge\\, could create movies with the larger\\, multi-trilogy timeline in mind. \\n\\nThis disaster of a movie is evidence of when a large company hands creative control to one person for just one movie\\, who creates it within the context of their own ideas on the next 2. Then someone else comes in\\, full of confidence\\, and completely dismantles any of those ideas and drives the franchise nose first into the red dirt. Something terrible happened here\\, and like any bad business or creative decision\\, an apparent lack of basic market research doomed this movie. Most fans hearing even glimmers of this script would have said no two years ago.","true":true}
