Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is like opening a Christmas gift and getting socks or underwear\\,  usefull \\, yes but completely underwhelming and nothing to get excited about. To me its only better than TPM and AOTC but only because of some of the acting \\,the so called story is NOT better than any other Star Wars movie to date.  That is all","true":true}
