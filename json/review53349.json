Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite all of the hate for this film\\, it really expanded on the Star Wars universe (this is what the movies are supposed to do\\, and not a bad thing at all). Director Rian Johnson\\, executive producer J.J. Abrams\\, and the rest of the team made narrative decisions that have received a ton of push back because many fans had stubborn expectations for how the film should play out. The hipocracy is clear: super fans hated The Force Awakens\\, as it was too similar to the old films\\, particularly A New Hope. Then\\, they hated The Last Jedi\\, because it was too different\\, and challenged what we think about Star Wars. In the end\\, there is no way to please everyone\\, and there will never be a \\\"perfect\\\" Star Wars film in the eyes of a fan who goes into the theater with an already closed mind. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan\\, and I didn't care for any of the thousands of fan theories before the film came out. Everyone was ranting about\\, \\\"Who's Snoke?\\\" \\\"Is Rey going to the dark side?\\\" \\\"Is Kylo going to the light?\\\" \\\"What's Luke going to be like?\\\" \\\"What about Leia?\\\" and I chose to ignore it all\\, so I could go into the film and have enjoyable movie experience without a ton of expectations that would just end up disappointing me. The movie was beautiful\\, and it portrayed it's characters in a way that made them human and relatable because\\, yes\\, they had FLAWS (even the mighty Luke Skywalker). I just can't wait to see how Episode IX further expands on the Star Wars universe. Until then\\, I'm going to avoid the hate for this film and fan theories for the next so I can continue to keep an open mind\\, and continue to love Star Wars as I do. Go see The Last Jedi if you haven't. Ignore the hate.","true":true}
