Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot is questionable at best. I'll give it credit for being somewhat original but no nearly as dark as it should have been and poor character devolpment continues. The is anything but a continuation of the original franchise. it is an embarrassment to the franchise and the legacy Lucas created.","true":true}
