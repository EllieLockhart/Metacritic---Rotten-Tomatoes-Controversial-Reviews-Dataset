We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"7 years of waiting. And now such disappointments.\rExcellent technical solutions. The game uses all the resources of the PS4 to the full. The graphics are almost perfect. If you don't look closely. Cyclical movement of grass\\, cyclical ripples. But still\\, the PS4 imposes a restriction\\, so this is excusable.\rThe gameplay remains the same\\, new mechanics make it more exciting\\, but it is still the same as in the first part. The gameplay was not the most important in this game\\, but the main story and characters. That's where the problems start.\rThe whole message of the game is so superficial\\, so petty\\, that it does not cause emotions\\, sympathy or empathy for these single-celled heroes. In the first game\\, you empathize with Joel and Ellie. They develop\\, find common ground\\, become close. In the second part\\, this completely disappears. Their experiences just start to irritate with their idiocy. The only thing that causes emotion is Joel's stupid death. Then the meaning is simply lost in these petty experiences\\, faceless and flat characters. The end of the game... I should have tried to think of something dumber. It is clear that any killer has feelings\\, life... So let's forgive EVERYONE now. What kind of limited morality?!\rI don't understand why there are so many AI dithyrambs? He's terribly stupid. Locations where there are hostile people\\, pass sitting in one corner\\, killing one\\, the rest resort to it. And you take turns shooting them in the head. Very interesting\\, that's sarcasm. It's cool of course that they react with screams to the death of their partners\\, but it doesn't touch. Since after 2 seconds\\, the one who is grieving also dies from a shot in the head.\rIf the plot was interesting\\, it could be forgiven... But the game has outdated gameplay and no interesting story. This is not what we expected. Perhaps if you do not pass for 3 days before the release of the second part of the first\\, it is not so striking\\, but this is a weak excuse for the game that was waiting for 7 years. Complete disappointment.\rI think the game is adequate to the assessment of 6\/10. This is very sad as was expecting a masterpiece and got podelco.\rI apologize for my bad English ))\u2026 Expand","true":true}
