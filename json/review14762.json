Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I haven't seen a character as dynamic and unpredictable as Kylo Ren. Adam Driver's performance is captivating\\, and every scene with him kept my eyes . Daisy and the others gave it their all as well\\, and Rian Johnson made some very interesting choices that may upset dogmatic fans while exciting others. Gorgeously shot and scored... A wonderful ride!","true":true}
