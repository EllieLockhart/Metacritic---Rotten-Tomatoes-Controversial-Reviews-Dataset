{"101487":188749,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the hype for this movie is undeniable It was a let down of epic proportions. The action sequences are the only minor facet of this movie that makes the rediculous 2 and a half our run time remotely worth it. Nothing against the actors here but the emotion in this movie seems so forced and way too dramatic. This movie could have benefited from cutting 30 minutes . I'll write a full review later.","true":true}
