Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cast is phenomenal\\, however\\, hackneyed writing paired with a forced love triangle has resulted in a dud of a film. Not to mention I don't think they were familiar with the character of Luke or the ways of the Jedi at all. Why Rian Johnson chose to completely disregard J.J. Abrams set up of Kylo Ren destroying the Jedi temple with the knights of Ren and having him just defending himself from Luke is beyond me. We all knew Disney was doing they're own thing and abandoning cannon\\, but when there's not consistency between your own new writing\\, it's just unprofessional. \\nIn their defense\\, they were trying just to mix it up after so many people claimed The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope. But this has backfired horribly.","true":true}
