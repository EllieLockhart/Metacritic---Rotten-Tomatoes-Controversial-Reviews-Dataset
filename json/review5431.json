Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some flaws\\, this is the most grown-up Star Wars movie of all. The characters are deep and flawed\\, and their actions drive the story. The action sequences are thrilling\\, with some true jaw-dropping\\, gasp-out-loud moments. I don't think the Finn and Rose storyline is completely successful\\, but to me\\, the chances Rian Johnson has taken pay off with satisfying oomph\\, and I can not wait to see where we get to go next.","true":true}
