Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were bits of this movie that worked well. Some parts of the core story were even great.\\n\\nBut the entire B plot was unnecessary and undermined the main story. Several major sequences were absolutely nonsensical and counter to common sense. The writing of several characters feels incredibly childish\\, especially the rebel crew. That furby knockoff tries to hog the camera during action scenes. And if you think Darth Maul was killed off too quickly\\, wait until you see how fast they drop Phasma and Snoke right as they get interesting.\\n\\nI honestly feel like the writing for most scenes outside of Rey\/Kylo\/Luke triangle was embarrassingly amateur. Downright made-for-TV Disney. Especially anything to cement the villains as bad and the heroes as good. Doesn't treat the audience with any respect.","true":true}
