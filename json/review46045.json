Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but looks aren't everything. One of the worstly written\\, at times comedic throw-away to the Star Wars saga. Shame on you George Lucas for letting it get to this. \\n\\nThis reels of this movie should be burnt\\, since it's now in the past we should let Episode 8 die\\, and it's quite ironic that for a movie about failure and everyone failing\\, no one failed more than the writer\/director Rian Johnson.","true":true}
