Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a basic problem: the lack of any dramatic moment! We have (mostly) action\\, some dialogue\\, some (a few) reflection moments (the one with Yoda being very good) but except for this last one there's no sense of drama in any of them: mostly because of misconcepted humour\\, the rest because of bad decision in building scenes by the director\\, bad dialogues\\, or inconsistent secondary characters. \\nFor the story\\, Luke becoming an hermit lost in the sadness of bygone days due to something he saw in Kylo was a poor decision\\, not coherent with the popular conception of the jedi as true warrior of Fait (the Force!) but also Leia plays a bad part with this newfound pacifism of her. But no character has a good part at all\\, in the end.","true":true}
