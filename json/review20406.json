Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand the reservations about The Last Jedi\\, and agree that it is a departure from the \\\"traditional\\\" Star Wars narrative. However\\, that's what makes this movie such a crowning achievement. Rian Johnson's brilliance is that he was able to take everything we know about the Star Wars universe\\, shatter it into a million pieces\\, and then put it back together again to create something new and beautiful.","true":true}
