Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was great in my opinion\\, I liked the characters\\, the plot even thought it might not be as flashy as other movies\\,  and the humor was great to ok depending on the scene\\, it broke expectations for me and all the twists through me around. It's fine to not like it\\, but I don't see why even after reading the bad reviews I just don't agree with them.","true":true}
