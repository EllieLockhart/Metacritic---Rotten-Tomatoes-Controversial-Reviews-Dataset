{"101487":184177,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a 5 or 6 out of 10\\, but I feel compelled to give it only half a star in order to make up for the ridiculously high critic ratings. It is abundantly clear that these critics have ulterior motives for their ratings (i.e. money) because this movie can be described as mediocre at best and infuriating at worst to anyone with half a brain. In one movie that is an hour longer than it should be\\, Rian Johnson manages to destroy the characters of Luke\\, Snoke\\, BB-8\\, Leia\\, Yoda and Po in such a thorough manner that it is as if that's what he set out to do. All the while more and more cutesy\\, prequelesque CGI throwaway creatures are shoved into the frame with no purpose whatsoever except to sell toys. Characters behave in ways that make no sense\\, and says things completely out of character. There horrible side story simply to give one of the characters something to do in the movie. It has no impact on anything and could and should have simply been completely removed in editing. Slather on a generous helping of eye-roll inducing social justice warrior bullshit that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever\\, and you have The Last Jedi.","true":true}
