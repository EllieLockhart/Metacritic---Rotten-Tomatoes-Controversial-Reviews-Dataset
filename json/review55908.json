Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson achieves the feat of bringing us the fantastic Star Wars actions scenes we all love as well as establishing a meaningful and intelligent intellectual conflict within our main characters. The high points of this movie were fantastic\\, as we were able to see some incredible fight scenes-- both in space and on the ground-- as well as settling down for a few moments to go into a character's psyche. Johnson did a great job of showing the audience how each character's thought process works\\, and takes us away from the hi-tech flashiness to show us some raw emotions. Although the movie had some fantastic moments\\, it heavily lacked in other areas. These lacking areas most prominently stem from filler scenes\/filler characters. These were evidently placed in the movie simply to add on a third story as well as give some more action. While this will satisfy young members of the audience\\, it is quite disappointing if you're like to watch a consistently interesting and engaging movie. The low points of this film really took me out of it for the entire scene\\, but I quickly reentered as the plot got back on track.\\n\\nIn the end\\, it's a Star Wars film! They're always fantastic and I applaud Rian Johnson's courageous take on the story. While the movie has its flaws\\, its overall story telling and engagement was fantastic.","true":true}
