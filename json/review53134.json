Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie! It's very unique from other Star War movies while still being a movie strong in the force. I'm seeing some reviewers complain about Finn and Rose's adventure\\, but I loved it. I was disappointed in Poe and Holdo storyline. Themes of hope were heavy in this movie\\, they could have been more subtle with it. But the themes and story lines all connect in a satisfying way that make a complete and enjoyable movie all on it's own\\, but still exciting to view as part of a saga. The action scenes are among the best in any movie and I love the dialogue. I'm excited to see Star Wars 9 and can't wait to see Rian Johnson's new trilogy.","true":true}
