Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay so this movie is so freakin polarizing it\u2019s insane. In my book\\, this movie has questionable moments. They killed off snoke way too easily\\, without explaining who the hell he was. I understand that the emperor had the same issue\\, but at least the emperor\u2019s death was palpable and we knew he was a Sith Lord. Also the CGI to make snoke looked noticeably fake\\, even if it was good by CGI standards. I wish they had done what they did with the emperor and just used a human and then put prosthetics. Also the janitor Asian girl is annoying to say the least\\, and when she stopped Finn from killing himself\\, she didn\u2019t actually do anything\\, as not only did she allow the empire to continue attacking the base\\, but she also might have died too. Also Luke\u2019s death was so unnecessary\\, if the whole point of the hologram was to make him not get struck down by Kylo like Vader struck down Ben Kenobi\\, then it was rendered pointless when he ended up dying anyway. And since Carrie fisher died\\, no original characters remain for the next movie. Wonderful. Now I have no reason to watch the next movie. ","true":true}
