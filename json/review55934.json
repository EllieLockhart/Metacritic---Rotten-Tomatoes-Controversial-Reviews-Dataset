Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is not George RR Martin.  His goal of \\\"subverting expectations\\\" drove the franchise into a ditch.  The eternal optimist Luke Skywalker is completely gutted in this movie and completely non-linear the all of the character development up to this point.  Also\\, the new characters just don't stand on their own.  Rey is a Mary Sue...point blank.  She knows everything\\, does everything and even defeats a Jedi Master who has trained all his life.  Whereas Luke lost his hand in his first outing with Vader\\, Rey easily defeats her enemies who have been training with the force\\, some longer than she has even been alive.  Don't get me started with Space Leia...ugh!!!!  Knowing that Carrie Fisher died in real life they had the opportunity to give the character a fitting death in the saga.  Instead they choose to have her flying through space like Mary Poppins.  It is very disconcerting to see such a high critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  I'm trying to figure out what movie they were watching.","true":true}
