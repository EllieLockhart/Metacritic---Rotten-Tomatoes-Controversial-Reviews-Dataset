Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it does have pacing issues and one noticeably unnecessary subplot\\, The Last Jedi is a strong\\, complex entry in the Star Wars franchise that successfully develops its layered characters\\, both new and old\\, without sacrificing its exhilarating action. All while bringing along a few surprising and effective twists.","true":true}
