The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I actually find it annoying that this game was bombed with negative reviews within hours of its release. As someone who has played the entire game I can confidently say that it is amazing\\, I do not believe it is better than the first one however it doesn't come too far off. The fact that people are giving the entire game 0 out of 10 reviews is a shame before even playing it because they're pressed about the death of Joel. Regardless I never thought of that to be a problem when it came to gameplay or visuals\\, people are saying the entire game is trash due to the fact that they're butthurt about one thing which truly is unfair to people who wanted to play the game as they get a misconstrued idea of what the game actually is. I had no problem with any of the gameplay\\, in fact I believe the gameplay aspect was better than the first. The biggest criticism of the game is the storyline\\, I agree it is worse than the first game but as a whole it really isn't even a quarter as bad as people make it out to be. The only thing I didn't like about it was the ending sequence between Ellie and Abby\\, I understand peoples frustration how she didn't even end up getting killed because trust me\\, I was just as annoyed. However\\, people don't appreciate the cutscenes we got between Ellie and Joel which to me provided more meaning to their relationship and ended the game in almost a perfect manner. I didn't care who I controlled\\, as long as I got a good game and I certainly did. Though as the player we are tasked with the impossible challenge to feel sympathetic toward Abby\\, we at least are provided with an explanation to her motives and know what her revenge story is as the game isn't completely about Ellie\\, and the gameplay we are given whilst controlling Abby is some of the best in the game (such as the hotel and hospital sequences).  If you are a salty 14 year old kid who can't deal with the fact that the main character isn't playable in this game\\, you need to grow up\\, Naughty Dog took a bold move and still made one of the best games to play without him. Its not like we saw nothing of Joel the whole way through\\, in fact the cutscenes we got were probably more meaningful than any gameplay we could have had with Joel\\, so I advise people to actually play the game - yes the story isn't as good but the game is incredible\u2026 Expand","true":true}
