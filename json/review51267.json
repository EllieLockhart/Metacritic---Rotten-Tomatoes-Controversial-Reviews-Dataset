Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely stunning\\, it is the best in the series. Incredible action and gorgeous imagery. The cast is impeccable (bar maybe Benicio Del Toro's DJ\\, who doesn't quite work) and the central narrative between Kylo Ren and Rey has some of the absolute best scenes ever from Star Wars. I don't know who these people are that saying it's the worst ever. It's the best.","true":true}
