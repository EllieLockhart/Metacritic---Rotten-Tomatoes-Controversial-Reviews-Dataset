We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Visually beautiful\\, beyond AAA quality\\, unfortunately that's the only thing good about The Last of Us 2.\r\rNaughty Dog took everything that was beloved about the 1st game and threw it all away. The father-daughter hard-earned relationship built up between Joel and Ellie? Gone. The caring\\, \\\"I would do anything to save you (Ellie)\\\"\\, love that Joel had to protect Ellie? Gone.\r\rJoel *is* one of the main characters of The Last of Us (and my favorite) and ND kills him off in a lazy cutscene that is so ridiculous and unbelievable you wonder how lazy Neil Druckmann got. Joel (and Ellie) have taken down hundreds of Infected and encountered disturbed Humans (like the Cannibals) in Part 1. Joel and Tommy (his brother) have seen all manner of corrupted people\\, so there's ZERO chance Joel would just roll into the WLF facility\\, unguarded and let himself get captured (and then killed in a cutscene). Awful.\r\rThe worst part is that he dies by the hand of basically the child of a random NPC you kill in Part 1. Just a grunt. But they try and make Abby's story \\\"meaningful\\\"\\, except NO ONE asked or cared about wanting to play the daughter of a random Firefly NPC. Abby's story and the WLF's feels like filler \/ junk\\, and you're *forced* to spend hours (a good 40% of the game?) playing this terrible side character.\r\rThen you're forced as the player to try and fight and kill Ellie (the other main character)\\, as Abby. WTH?! Sure it sounds \\\"novel\\\" but as a player and longtime fan of Part 1\\, disregarding your main 2 characters Joel and Ellie\\, and trying to play through this game as Abby (part of the enemies in this universe) is disappointing and I hated every second of it.\r\rAgain\\, *no one* wanted this.\r\rAnd in the end\\, this was just a story about Hate\\, Anger and Revenge. And when it failed\\, try revenge again\\, and again\\, and again.\r\rThe Last of Us Part 2 has no soul\\, no heart. Beautiful and brutal\\, but a terrible story and disappointing character development for the main characters that everyone cared about in part 1. Avoid at all costs.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
