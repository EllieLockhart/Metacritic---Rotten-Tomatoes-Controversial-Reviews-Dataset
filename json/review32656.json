Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last Jedi is my favorite star wars movie ever it's Soo good the writting is amazing all the characters are at there best it's much better than any of the prequels the score stakes and scope are all fantastic then ending is great as well. And Luke skywalker has a great arc in this movie and it's just the best editing is pretty good as well","true":true}
