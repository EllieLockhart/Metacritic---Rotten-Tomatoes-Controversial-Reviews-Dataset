Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the movie and have been twice already within 4 days - both times a 3D showing\\, which never happens with me!  There's so much to consider in this movie!  I haven't been this emotional about a Star Wars movie in years.  There are parts that didn't land well with me\\, but more that I was either delighted by or shocked and amazed. I haven't had the urge to discuss what I've seen in a Star Wars movie in a long time\\, but I want to talk to everyone I know about The Last Jedi\\, to see what they think.  I enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, but I didn't have this 'need to discuss' reaction with that film.  I highly recommend not only seeing the film\\, but seeing it more than once because to take it all in.","true":true}
