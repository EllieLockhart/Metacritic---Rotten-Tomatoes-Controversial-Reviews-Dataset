Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor was Space Balls level (which was a great show by itself) but doesn't belong here. If you like Jar Jar level humor\\, and often\\, then sure. I loved TFA and the originals. They missed so many opportunities and threw them away at every turn for a terrible and cheap laugh they just forgot the seriousness or anything. Also Canto Bight\\, Rose\\, Phasma\\, and Fin are useless in this movie and everything they do is proven irrelevant and a waste of time in the film. Cut out their part and literally nothing changes. Well\\, except maybe the last shot of the film which was pretty ok. It will definitely stop below episode 3 on my rankings. If not for John Williams this would drop below Epsiode 2.","true":true}
