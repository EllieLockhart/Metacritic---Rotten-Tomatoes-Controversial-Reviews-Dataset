Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it today. Left the cinema feeling very strange! It was a film of two halves. Second half far better than the first. Overall I'm disappointed though. Rubbish Ill timed humour\\, disjointed and inconsistent story arcs. Given the build up from force awakens\\, I was left very flat that certain evil characters won't be back in the final episode! I think it's finally happened\\, after 30 years\\, I've got Star Wars fatigue. Disney will milk this until eventually the enthusiasm wains and they finally decide to stop making star wars movies. I'm not sure I have the stomach for Han Solo or any others! Thanks to G Lucas for the original 3\\, I'll only ever watch these from now on!","true":true}
