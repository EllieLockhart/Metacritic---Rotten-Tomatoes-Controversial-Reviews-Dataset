Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say thats not already been said.  If this didn't have the name \\\"Star Wars\\\" attached\\, this would've totally bombed at the box-office.\\nAs for the critical reception\\, I find it unfathomable.","true":true}
