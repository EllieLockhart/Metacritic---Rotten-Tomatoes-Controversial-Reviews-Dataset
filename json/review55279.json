Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leave the past behind-- shhhh**** I wish I could leave The Last Jedi behind.\\n\\nI get they are trying to make another generation of movies. Call it something else. Don't call it Star Wars. We already saw the hermit Jedi master(Yoda). Why couldn't they make Luke a bad ass Jedi master. After all\\, 6 movies revolve around his character.\\n\\nEven Mark Hamil didn't like the way Luke was headed. Check out the vanity fair article.\\n\\nNow that Luke is dead\\, Hamil can really tell us how he feels. Which I think he will eventually.\\n\\nMary Poppins act was lame. \\nCasino scenes were not necessary.\\nPurple hair commander vs Poe was lame. Poe went from hero to crazy guy. Why? \\n\\nI should have realized this was bad when Rian Johnson said he was a big fan of the prequels.\\n\\nMost famous line: \\\" I got a bad feeling about this\\\" was missing. No wonder\\, the director didn't want any actors to say it. It would be used in EVERY review.\\n\\nAll I hope now is Disney (Fox purchase) doesn't screw up Avatar\\, but lucky for us avatar may be too far along to have any major changes.","true":true}
