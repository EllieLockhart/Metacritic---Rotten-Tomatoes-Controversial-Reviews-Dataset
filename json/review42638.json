Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was comically bad on so many levels it is difficult to know where to begin. \\n\\nHorrible dialogue\\, retread story lines\\, ridiculous scenes (like Princess Leah floating in space\\, Luke dusting off his shoulders\\, and an absurd and unnecessary detour to a casino planet) all but rendered this film unwatchable.\\n\\nAfter Rouge One\\, the spirts of die hard life long Star Wars fans were lifted\\, but the Last Jedi has all but destroyed any hope of the franchise correcting for the mistakes of the past and instead embracing them.
