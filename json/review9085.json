Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of plot holes\\, dismantles - does not build on - The Force Awakens\\, ruins Luke Skywalker and mis-writes other pre-established characters\\, pushes political ideology\\, revolves around the central theme of letting go of the good vs evil norms that the series is known for but then chickens out and reverts back to good vs evil at the end of the film\\, leaves the story in a \\\"why should I care what comes next?\\\" situation. I walked out of the theater in shock. This movie is a mess and will be known as the film that made star wars episodes \\\"just another movie.\\\" At least it was fun to watch\\, simply for the spectacle of the original trilogy being disrespected to such a degree.","true":true}
