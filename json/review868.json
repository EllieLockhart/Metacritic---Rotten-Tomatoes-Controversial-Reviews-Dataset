Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A nice departure from the retread of The Force Awakens into new territory with an amazing score (as per usual)\\, amazing choreography\\, amazing cinematography\\, and an amazing cast\\, among other things. Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver give standout performances. The subplot with Finn\\, Rose\\, and the new shifty character DJ leave a bit to be desired but an amazing Star Wars entry none the less.","true":true}
