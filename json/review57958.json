Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What... was this movie about?  What were the themes?  What was the character progression?  Why is the most beloved Star Wars character of all time turned into a coward?  Why is he afraid of this emo kid?  Who thought that completely destroying all of our favorite characters and attempting the replace them with vapid and undeveloped paper dolls?  It looked pretty.  I thought the sound was great.  This is the first piece of Star Wars I will not spend another dime on.  Do you hear me Disney?  This is not how you get my money.","true":true}
