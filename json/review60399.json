There\u2019s a clear lack of objectivity by tens of thousands of people leaving a review here\\, and clearly a fair few of those haven\u2019t even touched the game.Spectacular graphics\\, refined gameplay and an emotionally driven story that makes this yet another fantastic addition to Naughty Dogs now growing list of classics.The two issues I have story-wise do relate to some of the decisions made. For me\\, what makes The Last of Us different from usual survival horror\/apocalypse type games is that relationship between Joel and Ellie. The Last of Us IS that relationship more than the world itself and is at the very core of what makes the first game special. If you remove one of those elements then you risk falling back in to just another game\\, albeit a high level one.The second issue is the trope of revenge. While naturally you would expect the people closest to Joel to want redemption\\, the game prides itself on being grounded and it would be hard to accept that in real life\\, in such a horrendous world\\, you would leave the sanctity of Jackson to travel hundreds of miles in to an absolute fortress to try and find one person. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker but it does take away from that grounded atmosphere it tries to create.That being said\\, I\u2019m more than happy to be an observer of Druckmann\u2019s story\\, given that he is the creator\\, much like I would he reading any novel. I admire the fact that they didn\u2019t rest on their laurels and pay loads of fan service to the game\\, purely to please the (seemingly aggressive) dedicated fan base to this franchise. I want to play a linear story game to be told a story\\, not to cross off a checklist of things I wanted to see in the game. Generation defining game\\, not quite at the level of the first game\\, but the expectations for this sequel were so high that was always going to be a challenge.It\u2019s a shame that there is an ever present immature streak among a lot of gamers that can\u2019t be objective enough to form an opinion on this game without jumping on a bandwagon.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
