One thing to note is I praise naughty dog for its gameplay in this title\\, it feels much more of a game than the first Last of Us but that does affect pacing\\, sometimes it felt like a grind to go through some parts of the game but this was rare. Gameplay wise\\, it\u2019s done very well\\, it\u2019s one of the reasons why I want to replay it as it was satisfying to play through\\, graphics on a PS4 Pro were incredible too. Soundtrack is also a massive W. This game focuses on its world building and gameplay a lot which I quite like\\, the story won\u2019t be for everyone as I explained earlier but the gameplay and satisfaction will keep you hooked.
