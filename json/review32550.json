Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"star wars the last jedi es una pel\u00edcula incre\u00edble con momentos de acci\u00f3n\\,humor \\,etc. tiene sus puntos positivos y negativos pero aun asi me gusto la pel\u00edcula.","true":false}
