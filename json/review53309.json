Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cool special effects and music.  Terrible story and plot holes.  Luke was not the Luke he should have been.  Luke the Redeemer is going to kill his nephew because he thinks he is going to the dark side. WTF Anyways terrible except for a few bright spots.  Rey is cool and kylo and snoke are terrible and not in the good way.","true":true}
