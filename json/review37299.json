Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot holes consumed the film. I cringed through the whole movie thinking \\\"no!\\\" over and over again. I have been a huge star wars fans since I was a little kid and I never been more unsatisfied and excruciatingly disappointed with a movie. 1\/2 star is far too much.","true":true}
