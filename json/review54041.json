{"101487":130192,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider myself a casual SW fan\\, and I found The Last Jedi to be extremely lackluster. When you look at the big picture\\, yes\\, the production value is there. But nowadays high quality sound and visuals is something you need to take for granted.\\n\\nSadly\\, I cannot judge TLJ for its production values. I think the story is really bad. It mocks not only The Force Awakens set up but also the whole SW universe. Nothing is what it seems\\, there is no villain (literally\\, there is NO single villain in this movie\\, not even one you can symphatize with)\\, the protagonists do nothing remarkable\\, the new characters are completely unnecessary\\, etc. Especially Luke's fate is really painful in the way Johnson treated his character. You can see how Mark Hamill was genuinely disappointed and disagreed in the new direction of this character. I understand \\\"the torch must be passed\\\" to new generations\\, but sadly\\, this movie fails miserably in making you care for these \\\"new characters\\\" or \\\"new hope\\\".\\n\\nI will not talk about the SJW load and the failed jokes in this movie as it is not worth mentioning. Suffice to say it was completely unnecessary and it was definitely the \\\"magic hand\\\" of Disney.\\n\\nNow Jar Jar Abrams will need to fix this complete mess Johnson did for the 9th movie\\, for which I have nothing to expect as there is nothing to speculate anymore\\, as every interesting character was killed by Disney in this movie.\\n\\n#NotMyLuke","true":true}
