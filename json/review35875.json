Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi plot is trash don't believe the hype. Still haven't forgiven Disney for disregarding almost everything from the EU as \\\"Legends\\\" just so they could make room for their own shitty story and characters. The prequels may have had bad acting (mainly anakin) but at least they were ambitious and built upon the Star Wars Mythos instead of whatever the fuck the The Last Jedi is working towards story wise. Also you had a perfect setup from the EU with Darth Plagueis that would have connected all 3 trilogy with the Skywalkers together but nope no backstory at all....","true":true}
