Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie because\\, well\\, it is a Star Wars movie after all. However\\, I feel really let down by the portrayal of Luke as comic relief and not much more.  I am not satisfied with Rey's backstory and the lack of Snoke's.  I don't hate the movie\\, but I feel as if Disney has abandoned the \\\"old\\\" fans to make way for the \\\"new\\\" fans. Just my opinion and you know what they say about those.","true":true}
