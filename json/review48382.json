Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all due respect\\, The Last Jedi has an interesting plot that does tire most. The film spends too much time with exploring the unneeded truth than exploring with its action sequences that end up bad\\, boring and cliche. The Last Jedi\\, will not be the film hooking you into the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
