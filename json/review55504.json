Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No question\\, this film is a visually stunning extravaganza\\, but the actions of nearly every character are fragmented\\, disjointed and unmotivated. The newest characters seem to serve no purpose\\, and with regard to the Skywalker saga\\, we're no further along at the end of this film than we were in The Force Awakens. Honestly\\, I wanted so badly to love this movie\\, but as a fan\\, I simply can't accept the choices Johnson has made with regard to Luke's character. His actions felt completely contrary to the honorable Jedi George Lucas gave us 34 years ago. I walked in elated with the anticipation of the return of the galaxy's ultimate Jedi and left frustrated and saddened at what Johnson has turned him into. Many may love it\\, but in my opinion\\, this is not the film for die hard fans of the characters we've come to love.","true":true}
