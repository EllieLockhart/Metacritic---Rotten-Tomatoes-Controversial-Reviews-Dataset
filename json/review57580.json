Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though it was visually stunning\\, it felt more like a Marvel movie than a Star Wars film. Plot lines from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" like Rey's Lineage and Snoke's backstory were dropped carelessly. The villains (other than Kylo who received tons of character development) were wasted. adding Rose served no purpose\\, and she and Finn had 0 chemistry. The whole segment where they go to find the code breaker was wasted time. I hated how they handled Po Dameron. If the leadership had just told him the plan instead of making him think they were doomed\\, nothing bad would have happened. All these issues said\\, I enjoyed the chemistry between Rey and Kylo\/the force linking. Loved Luke's force projection scene. Not sure where they're going to go with Episode 9\\, but hopefully it's better.","true":true}
