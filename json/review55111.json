Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was expecting something dynamic but it really just destroyed what \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" created.  Characters acted out of character\\, or were just plain thrown away before we had a chance to learn who they were.  There was way to much humor too so it was misleading in the previews. I thought this was a serious chapter going into it.  Overall it was a great Disney movie but a not so great Star Wars movie like \\\"Rogue One\\\" turned out to be.  Maybe they can get those guys to write the next and last in this trilogy. One last note\\,  where are all the familiar aliens like twi'leks\\, and Rodians? Why can't we have some alien heroes in the mix\\,  like a twi'lek scoundrel?  Instead we got gerbil pikachu's lol.  There were also a ton of unnecessary scenes like Luke milking an alien\\,  and the guy tasting the ground and saying it was salt. I think that was our clue that the writers were trolling the fan base.","true":true}
