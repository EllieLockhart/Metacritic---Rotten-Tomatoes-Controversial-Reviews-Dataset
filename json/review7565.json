Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every scene is so rushed that i cant figure out how they made the movie as long as it is.  No tension can be built because everyone has to break the serious moment with an out of place joke.  To anyone that has seen the movie\\, describe a character that died in the movie without using physical characteristics or saying they are good or bad\\, you cant.  A bunch of set dressing dies in this movie and its impossible to care.","true":true}
