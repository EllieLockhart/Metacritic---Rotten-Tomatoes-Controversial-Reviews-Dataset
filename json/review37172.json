Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing I loved about this was Adam Driver's character. Kylo Ren is tearing himself apart over his internal conflict and Driver does a great way of portraying it.\\nOtherwise\\, there is not a whole lot to love. Some interesting concepts are touched upon\\, but it feels rather superficial. Characters are acting dumb\\, the reason for some kinds of internal conflict are dumb. There are some plotholes\\, but most of them can be excused\\, in my opinion. Johnson's whole shtick about not caring about the the franchise up until now\\, its established rules and plot set up by Abrams ranges from making me feel condescended to to head-shaking confusion. Especially after watching Ep. 9\\, you notice that this is the movie that turns the trilogy into a clusterf***.\\nI don't believe history will be kind to this movie.","true":true}
