Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally someone did what had to be done: to do something new. Hardcore fans are wrong. Forty-something year olds\\, we all have to understand this is Star Wars for a new generation. For that same reason\\, the new producers cannot and should not give us more of the same. That is why this episode is the best thing to happen to SW in a long time.","true":true}
