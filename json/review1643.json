Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a massive star wars geek\\, I truly don't know what the naysayers are going on about. I was entertained throughout\\, and contented with all the usual SW stuff. I thought the Last Jedi was true to the series by holding on to glimmers of hope\\, yet successful in not pulling off a weird rebel victory as well. It actually makes me more interested in the series overall. All other rebel victories kind of felt symbolic..\\n\\nI think Luke was well portrayed\\, and kicked enough butt in the end to make me feel like I was watching Yoda own count Dooku again. His actions were totally in line with previous Jedi\\, but he achieved great things in the end.\\n\\nIt's probably more of a four star movie for me\\, but desserving of the extra star to offset the horrible reviews it's getting.","true":true}
