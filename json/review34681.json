Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critic reviews on this movie are extremely suspect. This movie\\, in my opinion\\, was the worst Star Wars movie in the franchises history and an insult to every original Star Wars fan out there. They killed the heart and soul of what made Star Wars iconic. If it weren't for Rogue One\\, this movie would have ruined every ounce of hope I had for the series going forward.","true":true}
