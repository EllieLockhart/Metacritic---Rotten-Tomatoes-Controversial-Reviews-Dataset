Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed the movie. It wasn't a fan service nostalgia trip like Force Awakens was (I liked Force Awakens too\\, but in a different way) .  Last Jedi certainly has a darker overall tone than its predecessor\\, but it does have it's lighter moments. Sure\\, there are parts that should be ridiculed (Mary Poppins Leia)\\, but I honestly think that most of the complaining about this movie is done by people who are upset that their predictions were wrong\\, as well as the disney haters.  Is it the best Star Wars movie? I don't think so. It has its flaws\\, but what movie doesn't?","true":true}
