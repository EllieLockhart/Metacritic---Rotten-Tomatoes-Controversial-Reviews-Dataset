Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How do i begin? It ruined star wars for life.. \\n\\nDon't see this turd they claim to be a movie. waste of time. Literally.. \\nI really hope this is just a bad dream. I was gonna go on a huge rant about how bad it is\\, \\nbut I think at this point everyone knows how bad the movie is. Even the hope that they'll  give us a real star wars movie in episode 9 is gone.. \\n\\nIf you feel as bad as I do\\, watching Guardians of the Galaxy 2 reminds you how to make a great movie and somehow eases the pain\\, if only for few a minutes.  Still worst star wars movie ever made. #notmystarwars","true":true}
