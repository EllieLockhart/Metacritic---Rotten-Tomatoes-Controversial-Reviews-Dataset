Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to defy expectations and do something new that's great but don't forget you still have to earn it. It looked beautiful but storywise it was all lazy\\, cheap\\, or stupid. Every character in it is staggeringly incompetent. They managed to make the longest star wars yet and make it feel like a bad filler episode from the clone wars. In short wasted potential.","true":true}
