Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! I tried going in with zero spoilers. There were so many great action sequences and a lot of fun moments. Laughed\\, cried. Carrie Fisher as Mary Poppins! I wish there were more linear focus. It seems scattered at times where is telling too many stories at once. But what do I care\\, it was FUN! This movie is all about hope. Very Disney. GOING TO SEE THIS ONE AGAIN AND AGAIN ","true":true}
