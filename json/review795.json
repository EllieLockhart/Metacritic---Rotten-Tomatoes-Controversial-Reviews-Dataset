Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Newer Hope - This movie has finally given me hope that the force of magic and juiciness in the franchise is back. Coming from someone who's seen every Star Wars movie in the theater\\, this one gave me the satisfaction at the level of The Empire Strikes Back. Take away the incredible fight scenes\\, clever writing\\, and witty humor; it was finally nice to see that the battle between good and evil isn't absolute. Some of the greatest heroes show a dark side and some of the most wicked villains show a bright side. Revealing the human spectrum inwardly instead of outwardly is a refreshing and welcome move on the franchise's part. Many people might not get this or be ready for it. But time will tell\\, and this movie will be remembered as possibly the best Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
