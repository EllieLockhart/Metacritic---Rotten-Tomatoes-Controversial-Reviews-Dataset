Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a really cool movie\\, but I enjoyed more the second time I watched it.  The first time I was thrown by some things (a certain Mary Poppins event springs to mind).  The second time through I could sit back and enjoy the solid movie-making.  Also\\, I total love Daisy Ridley character & love watching her in every screen.","true":true}
