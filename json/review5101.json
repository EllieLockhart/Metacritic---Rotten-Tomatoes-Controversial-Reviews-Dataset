Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"critics are so biased it's incredible They are way to disconnected with the audience\\, but remember we are the ones buying the movie tickets. This is just an ok movie made for profits not for the real fans","true":true}
