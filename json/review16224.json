Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m no die hard Star Wars fanatic\\, but I\u2019ve seen them all more than once. That said\\, I was very disappointed with this movie\\, and seriously almost fell asleep once or twice. They tried to inject humor a lot of places and most of them weren\u2019t funny at all. The new villains came across like cartoon characters\\, and acting \/ directing also came out awkward many times. This is by far my least favorite movie in the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
