Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been ambivalent about the Disney-era Star Wars films for a while\\, not because I think Disney is a corporate overlord unfit to handle them\\, but because they bought the rights only several years ago and have pushed these movies out so fast. There was no way\\, I thought\\, that there could be an actual vision or well-thought out story under these circumstances\\, and that seems to have been how it's played out. \\nI simply do not understand how a poorly-written\\, thin\\, and at times incomprehensible film can attract mostly positive reviews. There are so many small things to gripe about\\, which would be fine if the story was well-written and engaging\\, but it isn't. The only highlights for me were some of the smaller things like the Porgs and those rabbit-horses on Canto Bight\\, because otherwise I felt lingering confusion and disapppointment throughout the film.\\nJust a few things: 1. Why the over-the-top trick to save Leia\\, when it would have been such an obvious choice to axe her character in this movie rather than Luke? 2. I guess we never get to know jack about Snoke because he dies before he's even fully established (also why is the successor to Palpatine almost a carbon-copy of him? Is he a clone?) 3. Giving a romantic interest (Rose) to the least developed character in the movie (Finn) falls flat - what qualities are there to attract her to him? None! 4. Why doesn't Holdo let Poe in on her plan\\, even at the risk of mutiny? There's no reason to keep it a secret\\, and the way they explain it afterwards seems like a cheap way to further this weirdly under-thought thene of valuing survival over confrontation.\\n\\nNitpicking\\, sure\\, as I guess all critical commentary can be described. But if a grand vision or sense of magic is lacking\\, it's the details that then stand out.","true":true}
