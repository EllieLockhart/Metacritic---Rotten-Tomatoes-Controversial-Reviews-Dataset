Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (don't worry\\, no spoilers) is a two hour and thirty minute cringe compilation that manages to make the shameless and creatively bankrupt nostalgia(TM) product \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" look good by comparison.\\n\\nIt's unfortunate that the few well-executed and memorable scenes that have any real impact are in service of a resurrection of a resurrection of a rebellion (#theresistance) - one that was created artificially to avoid the political complexities that would have emerged after Return of the Jedi\\, and is staffed by a bunch of irredeemable losers (and not enough aliens dammit\\, where are the aliens?)\\n\\nEarly reviews suggested that this movie would\\, rather than opening the corresponding original trilogy script in a new Word document and using the Find & Replace tool\\, subvert the expectations laid out by The Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nIf they were referring to The Last Jedi's comically underdeveloped characters\\, abysmal pacing\\, abhorrent CGI monstrosities\\, insulting attempts at humor\\, caricatured villains\\, and trope-riddled carcinogenic dialogue\\, then yeah\\, I'd call that subversion a success.","true":true}
