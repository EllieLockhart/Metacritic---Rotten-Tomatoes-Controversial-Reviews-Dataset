Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok. First of all\\, I wish that people would stop framing Rian Johnson\u2019s work on this film as \u201cbold choices\u201d. That\u2019s like peeing on us and telling us that it\u2019s only rain. The harsh truth is that it is a bad movie. There\u2019s really no other way to say it. How do I know this? Because half the fans hate it. Because it totally disrespected what came before it. Because\\, for the first time in my life\\, I left a Star Wars product (film\\, tv show\\, or book) with a bad (negative) feeling about it. Having said that\\, I look forward to JJ Abrams return to the helm for episode IX. JJ understands and respects the Star Wars legacy. Help us JJ. You are our only hope.","true":true}
