Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a freakin' GENIUS and you butt-hurt fanboys are pathetic losers!!\\n\\nI created a Masterpiece thats too SUBTLE and too COMPLICATED for your tiny fanboy brains to comprehend!\\n\\nYou're all BIGOTS and FASCISTS who HATE DIVERSITY!! Arrrghhhhh!!!\\nYour TOXIC WHITE MASCULINITY can't handle strong women schooling men! You ain't WOKE! \\n\\nI've already written a draft for Episode 9: Luke comes back and converts to lSLAM.
