Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If these new trilogy movies show us anything\\, it's that the Chosen One hero isn't the solution. In the original trilogy\\, the Rebel Alliance wins through Luke's personal victory in defeating the Emperor and turning his father back to the Light Side and through Leia's leadership in destroying two Death Stars.\\n\\nHowever\\, their victory is short-lived. Luke tries to reform the original Jedi Order and fails. The New Republic is fraught with dishonesty and bickering\\, forcing Leia to form The Resistance in secret and witness her democratic republic literally crumble into space dust.\\n\\nInstead\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" shows us that true heroes aren't just one person chosen to hold the power or prestige to succeed\\, but are made up of a group of people. It's people like Rose Tico\\, who represent the hundreds with The Resistance\\, that have a real stake in fighting The First Order. And it's people like Finn and Rey\\, who have only glimpsed at a world bigger than themselves and are willing to fight to keep it and find their place in it.","true":true}
