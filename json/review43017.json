Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was too long and tremendously boring.  I consider myself a fanatic and it wrecks me that I hated this installment.\\n\\nSo many questions remain.  Who was Snoke?  Where are the Knights of Ren?  Why did Luke try to kill Kylo?  Who are Rey's parents?  Why did Yoda torch the Jedi texts?  Why did Luke have a map if he didn't want to be found?  Why did Luke lightsaber call to Rey?\\n\\nSo many irritating things about this movie exist.  Rose is worse than Jar Jar Binks.  Luke throws his \\\"Lazer Sword\\\" over his shoulder.  Luke is slightly unhinged.  Luke milks a elephant\/walrus\/cow.  Rey is automatically great at everything.  Leia can fly.  Chewie is a vegetarian.  And on and on.\\n\\nIf you haven't already\\, don't spend one dime on this.  I will not go see Solo and I will likely not go see episode 9.  What Disney did to Star Wars is unforgiveable.","true":true}
