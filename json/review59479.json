It plays with the concept of perspective in the characters\\, to develop certain empathy but also necessary distance. And in the end you understand all the motivations behind it all because the script fits perfectly into its 4 acts. It really moved me much more than the first one\\, apart from being much more plausible and spun. For example\\, here I find more convincing reasons to kill an enemy than I had in the first game. I really feel like this universe is built in a more adult way. Even in certain issues like the characters looking away when we try to get close to them with the camera is a sign that their lives belong to them\\, like for example in Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\\, where we are one of the voices handling Senua and he looks away from our excessive control. Their lives are theirs. And that's why at certain times the decisions are feared by them and not by us. The Last of Us 2 is probably the best video game I've ever played.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
