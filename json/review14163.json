Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you went into the movie with emotional ties to fan theories\\, and ideas of what this SHOULD be\\, you will be disappointed. However\\, as a Star Wars film it's incredibly unique\\, and well made. It's not perfect\\, but no film is. It improves upon a second viewing after expectations have been beaten.","true":true}
