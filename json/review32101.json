Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers. Sloppy and disappointing. What happened to the knights of Ren\\, snook\u2019s origin\\, Rey\u2019s origin\\, captain phasma? Bad bad storyline for Luke. Watched it twice coz I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw the first time. Had to watch it again to make sure i wasn\u2019t stupid to have missed all those stories that were set up in force awakens and unceremoniously dropped in this one. Where the heck is the lore master for these films? ","true":true}
