The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a gem\\, it is a game that is super well made and looks like a movie. In fact\\, this criticism did not play the game\\, it goes towards those **** crappy subsectors\\, human spoils that defend CD projekt Red because they are sectarians of that company and defend cyberpunk 2077 and the Witcher 3 as if they were his parents or as if his life depended on it when in fact their lives are insignificant and everyone's dick is sweating what he's doing and nobody pays attention to them and that's why they do that. How pathetic your life\\, and on the other hand what they do is attack the last of us 2 because they put minorities and put characters that are lesbian and (supposedly) the game has a political agenda\\, say some subnormal when they don't even know what that means. I'm going to ask you one thing\\, **** what the hell do you care if minority or LGBT characters have gotten involved when in fact this is better for the industry because that way the public is wider and on top of that you have not created the game and surely you attack them without having a clue and without having tried it in the slightest and something else\\, if the developers get the hang of putting those things in\\, they do it because it's their game **** go with the **** Poles\\, bone your CD projekt **** network and when you have a law or political science degree you talk to me about what political agenda means and those political terms that you don't have you have no idea that they are worth **** **** that you talk about without a **** idea because a youtuber called saselandia brainwashes you that he does not have and also toxic video game youtubers say bull**** and you eat it with potatoes because you are **** I'm sick ok? In conclusion\\, I give the game a 10\/10 I liked it a lot and I played it not like other characters\\, oh and postscript there is one thing that I have not said this goes for all those who have not started the game: Joel dies at the beginning\\, ok? they put a shotgun in his knee and they put him in a box with a golf club and he died come they give you in the ass\\, a spoiler as a gift\\, for touching your cock.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
