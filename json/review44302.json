Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many inconsistencies. The Force Awakens had a few\\, but this carries it to new heights. As a hardcore fan of Star Wars\\, I'm not someone who is hard to please. I want to like anything with the brand name. This one\\, I can;t.\\n\\nFirst\\, Rose is on the same level as Jar Jar Binks. Not the actresses fault\\, just a poorly written story. The entire Fin & Rose arc was TERRIBLE. Fin was somewhat redeemable at the end when he attempts to sacrifice himself\\, which then gets foiled by Rose.\\n\\nThe bombers in this movie are pathetic. Y-Wings would have been far better for the bombing run at the start. All the villains feel incompetent instead of clever. Not to mention\\, supposedly the First Order has been in the shadows moving so as to not attract attention\\, then in this movie they are apparently the unstoppable war machine.\\n\\nRey is still a Mary Sue. Luke is a sissy. And talk about a slap to the face\\, we don't even get to see Luke mourn for his best friend Han Solo. Additionally\\, Luke isn't even Luke. You know\\, Luke\\, who risked all to save his father. In this movie\\, he tries to kill his nephew on a whim.\\n\\nWhat was that last battle? Sure\\, we'll throw the EU out. Then in Rogue One we show that Star Destroyers have the ability to hover above a city. But in this movie\\, the Star Destroyers can't enter the planet's atmosphere? One Star Destroyer could've destroyed the entire base at the end no problem.\\n\\nNope\\, instead lets land a full mile away and slowly walk an attack force up to the door.\\n\\nThis movie was pathetic. It wasn't even enjoyable. I'm not digging into EU concepts because Disney said they don't matter. Fine. At least make a movie that makes sense. This one didn't even fit with any of the past movies. And to make it worse\\, I came out only having enjoyed one scene\\, and that was the Kylo Ren fight. (Snoke's death was also as pathetic as the rest of the movie)","true":true}
