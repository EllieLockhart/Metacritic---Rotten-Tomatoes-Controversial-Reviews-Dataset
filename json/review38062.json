Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story is one big long chase scene which makes no sense. Sub plots are created for no point. Physics doesn't seem to exist in this movie. Luke's character acts complete opposite to how Luke is throughout the original trilogy. It's almost as if the writer made this as a fan fiction and never watched a star wars movie before. Easily the worst star wars ever and it's killed the star wars franchise.","true":true}
