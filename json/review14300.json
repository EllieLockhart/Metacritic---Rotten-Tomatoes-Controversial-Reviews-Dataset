Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I got the chance to watch he last Jedi with my parents and I have to say it was a awesome time\\, i enjoyed\\, it\\, personally I don't understand the hate I see online\\, I look in the comments on pretty much anything and all I see is people bashing just about every aspect of the movie. Personally I thought it was good\\, I enjoyed it more then I did episode 1 and 2 that's for sure","true":true}
