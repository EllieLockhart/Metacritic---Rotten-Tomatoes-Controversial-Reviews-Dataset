Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it!  Some bad special effects choices and a few random scenes and characters that don't serve any real purpose do distract from the story at times\\, but in terms of plot it was solid\\, surprising\\, fresh\\, and sets up this trilogy for and ending with a different character dynamic and a new kind of conflict we haven't seen before.  I am especially pleased with Luke's character arc.  Mark Hamill's performance was fantastic\\, maybe the best of his career\\, and Luke Skywalker is now a fully developed person instead of just a stoic hero figure.  If you can watch this film without too many preconceived notions of what it should be or what you want it to be and just take it in as it is\\, it is a great chapter in this saga.","true":true}
