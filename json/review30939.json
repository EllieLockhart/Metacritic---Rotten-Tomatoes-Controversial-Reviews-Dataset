Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed.\\n1) Snoke turns out to be nobody - after all the buildup???\\n2) Luke is a hermit ... timid ... and... dies???\\n3) Carrie Fisher or Admiral Ackbar should have been the hero kamikaze.\\n\\nThey ruined the characters\\, all because Rian Johnson and the writers wanted to be \\\"unpredictable\\\"....  I get that originality is important. But this movie is embarrassing - like a hipster who tries to be original and unpredictable by dressing and acting like every other hipster....\\n\\nWorst Star Wars since episode 1... and it had the potential to be the best since episode 5.","true":true}
