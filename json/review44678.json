Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total waste of time. All logic has to be suspended. Now we have to think that there is gravity in space to make bombs \u201cfall\u201c in space And there is no decompression apparently when spaceships get cut in half or bombay doors open. The movie was entirely fiction; there was no science to it.","true":true}
