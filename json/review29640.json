Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's inability to put himself in the mind of the reoccurring characters\\, and to understand the physics and nature of the force\\, have resulted in a film that lacks any cohesion to many precedents. It is as if he has disregarded the majority of the previous 6 films\\, and done has he pleased. Which is the equivalent of a writer with Alzheimer's. Storytelling is the most important aspect of Star Wars\\, and for someone to so fragrantly cast aside so many precedents\\, has thus made a joke of the series; very unfortunate.","true":true}
