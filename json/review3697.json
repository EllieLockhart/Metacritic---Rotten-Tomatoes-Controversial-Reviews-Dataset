Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than episode 7. I think the direction they're going is fantastic and I'm looking forward to episode 9. One critical note: I think Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) keeps turning out to be a whiny wanna be. He's no Vader but he definitely keep be worse.","true":true}
