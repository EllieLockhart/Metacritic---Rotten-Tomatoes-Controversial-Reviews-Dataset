Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a travesty of a film.  Disney has allowed a cult classic to be taken down even further than the prequels could have done.  I was okay with new direction\\, new characters and new plots. This movie\\, though\\, was horribly contrived.\\n\\n**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**\\nCharacter development was poorly done and now we won't even have the chance to see how some characters came about.  We still don't have much backstory about the two main protagonists and the slight lunge at backstory for one was a complete letdown.\\n\\nThe plot has holes all in it and undervalues both sides\\, and at times completely overvalues the First Order.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe is with Luke's character.  We miss so much of the real story to what he did in between Return of the Jedi and now.  Even when we do hear some\\, it's a he said thing version of stories.  And the end......I guess Rian Johnson thought it might somehow make Luke seem really powerful\\, but it just comes off as cheapening actually.  Most wanted to see Luke in an involved fight - to see just how strong and capable he had become in the force\\, but no\\, we get a cheap looking parlor trick to be his end.\\n\\nIn hindsight\\, it was an entertaining film\\, but not a good Star Wars movie.  The Star Wars universe was always about the characters\\, but Last Jedi drops the ball here.\\n\\n- Thanks for nothing\\, Disney.","true":true}
