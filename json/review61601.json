We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Just finished playing the gameAll I can say is I hate itGraphics : 10\/10 the graphics is at best for a console video gameFighting mechanics : 3\/10 nothing new\\, only few animations which was implemented in fighting and of course now you can stealth prone... which was introduced in gaming maybe over 15 years ago in metal gear solid. Story : 0 \/10And of course\\, the STORY is garbage. In a story driven video game the story is what matters.In this game the characters make stupid choices.One example is the first game game Joel\\, he just give his name to a group of strangers with guns. Knowing that there are people looking for him after the choice he made in the first game.And of course there is Abby\\, which will kill Joel in a brutal way at the very first 2 hours of the game.Then you\u2019ll be forced to play as this character who killed the best thing about the first game for almost 11 hours.  In this game they kill Joel and make you play as the character who killed him\\, then try to make you sympathize with Abby. Which is almost impossible after what she did. The rest of the story feels boring\\, thanks to the bad writing.And what makes the game worse is the forced agenda with meaningless charactersDefinitely a Zero from me as a fan of the original game.And maybe it might get 5 or 6\/10 from a non-biased revier\u2026 Expand","true":true}
