Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a massive star wars fan my entire life but this is the first time i have left the theater feeling like im cool if this is the last one i watch.so many plot holes created in this movie i cant list them all in one post . From the space chase that the first order could have ended by jumping ahead of the resistance with a couple of ships and trapped them to the complete lack of any mention of why luke left a map to find him when he says he just wants to die on ach to.the plot holes could even be ignored if anything in this movie had any sort of pay off. Ill save anyone who is thinking of watching this there money if ur hoping for answers to ur questions or any character growth\\, just wait to years and prey that jj can fix this mess because for a 2 30 hour movie u get non of that. Truly disappointing because ep7 wasn't great but at least it leaves u with wonder and excitement for the future which this movie does nothing even close. Also rose is just unnecessary don't waist your money","true":true}
