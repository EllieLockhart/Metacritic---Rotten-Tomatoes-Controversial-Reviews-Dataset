Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most bizarre addition to a film series I've ever seen.  The First Order is reduced to a slap stick routine straight out of Space Balls\\, Yoda (one of the wisest characters in film history) is a bumbling idiot\\, and 'the force' now allows for abilities like self holo-projection from light years away as well as flying through space.  The plot centers around the longest and slowest space chase in sci-fi history (maybe the writers watched too much Battlestar Galactica?).  So many missteps\\, it's difficult to count them all.  The only thing that makes this film watchable is the technical mastery and the gratuitously heaped on and often misplaced comedy bits.  Considering the film would get two stars automatically because it is a high budget Star Wars movie\\, the critics should be ashamed for their propping this thing up.  By the way\\, I have watched every Stars Wars movie\\, collected the toys and played the games and considered myself very open to wherever they wanted to take the series.  Consider my mind now closed.","true":true}
