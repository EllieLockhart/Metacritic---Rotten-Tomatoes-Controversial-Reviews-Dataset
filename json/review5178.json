Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Critics\\, \\n\\nClearly Disney has strong-armed you into providing a 93% review rating.  I have no other logical explanation as to how any of you could consider giving this embarrassment more than two stars.  Not commenting on the bad humor\\, bad acting\\, bad writing and too many subplots is bad enough.  But to dismiss commenting on Luke Skywalker being a whiny\\, selfish\\, bafoon makes it clear that Disney owns you and your ratings.","true":true}
