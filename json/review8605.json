Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off the bad things: Rose is an awful character and brings the film down a level\\, the whole casino planet sequence was terrible except from DJ\\, and there are some really dumb\/irritating moments.\\n\\nHowever\\, these points aside it is a very enjoyable\\, entertaining film that dares do to go where no Star Wars has gone before and has some of the most memorable scenes in the sagas history.\\nIf you didn't like it first time\\, like me\\, watch it again and it is 10x better.\\n\\nIt doesn't deserve this amount of hate.","true":true}
