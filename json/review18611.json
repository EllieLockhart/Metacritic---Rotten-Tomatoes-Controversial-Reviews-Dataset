Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It made no it was a mistake horrible side plot and plots and characters that go nowhere it tried so hard to be different that it failed to deliver a good story same parts were good and the porgs were far less annoying then I thought they would be but still.","true":true}
