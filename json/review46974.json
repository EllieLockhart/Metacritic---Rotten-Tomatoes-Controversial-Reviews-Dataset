Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a bunch of shills and paid reviewers these 'professional critics' are. Kudos to all the actors and actresses in this film - you did a fine job with what you had to work with\\, and should be proud.\\n\\nWhat a miserable\\, lame portrayal of Luke Skywalker though - from ROTJ hero to Last Jedi wet blanket. Completely unbelievable transformation\\, and a miserable and unbelievable demise to his character. While TFA set the stage for this with \\\"Luke Skywalker has vanished\\\"\\, etc. there was a golden opportunity to turn this around from the onset of TLJ when Rey found him.\\n\\nLet's hope the wonderful and beloved Mark Hamill lives long enough to see and star in a remake of this travesty.","true":true}
