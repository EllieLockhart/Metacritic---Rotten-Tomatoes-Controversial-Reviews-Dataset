Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"since I'm a positive person\\, I'll start with the good things about this movie. it is a beautiful movie\\, well shot with very cinematic scenes. it has great characters to work with. It deals with the relationship between Rey and kylo in a very interesting and poignant way. If all you want is a good movie then this film will suit you well. now for the bad that would be everything else. the main plot revolves around a Scooby Doo chase. Luke has given up. Finn is sent on a meaningless mission because they didn't know what to do with him. Poe is given a story arc that\\, in truth\\, does work\\, but that should have been avoided by Haldo just telling him the plan. it didn't need to be a secret. at all. The first order has a HUGE friggin navy\\, while the new republic has nothing. The thought of a disarming doesn't make sense because this movie shows a bunch of weapons dealers who are dealing to both sides. in other words\\, the new republic would have known that there was a huge navy about to attack them. chewie is all of the sudden remorseful about eating meat?. snoke dies with zero explanation of who he was... etc. etc. etc. this is a good movie. it is a terrible star wats movie.
