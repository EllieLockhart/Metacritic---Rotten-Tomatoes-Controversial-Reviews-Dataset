Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Me encanto el cambio de toda la trama\\, y no que fuera una copia del imperio contra ataca\\, PARA M\u00cd\\, es fenomenal y una expansi\u00f3n nueva para este un universo","true":false}
