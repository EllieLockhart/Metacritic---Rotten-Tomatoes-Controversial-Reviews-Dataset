Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Lifelong star wars fanatic who loved the evolution of this series with this movie and the awesome light saber battles. I'm excited that we see real growth and conflict in all the characters and that I have no idea what will happen next. I also shed a year at Leia's first appearance. ","true":true}
