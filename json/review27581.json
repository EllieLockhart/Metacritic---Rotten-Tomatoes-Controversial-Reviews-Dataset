Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall - thought it was pretty good. Johnson took the film on many directions that I didn't expect or that I had imagined they would have gone during the 2 year wait...and that's not a bad thing. Sure - it's not a perfect film. It's too long\\, one or two scenes were totally unnecessary and only serves to give characters something to do that would have otherwise been sitting around. Did I expect more or different answers to questions left unanswered from TFA? Definitely - but perhaps better answers will come in future films. If not - who cares. It's just a movie and I was entertained.\\n\\nI've been trying to understand the low ratings and all I can figure is that folks didn't get the movie they had made in their heads over the past two years. Perhaps when they get the chance to write and direct a Star Wars movie - then they can do what they want -  it Rian Johnson made this his own\\, sending the story off in new directions and I for one am excited to see where JK Abraham's takes it in Episode IX.","true":true}
