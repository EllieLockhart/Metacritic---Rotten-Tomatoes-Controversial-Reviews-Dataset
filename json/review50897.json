Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute disregard for anyone who grew up loving Star Wars. I have never felt so utterly shattered by a movie before and never thought I'd loose all interest in this franchise that has been so close to my heart... but here we are. So much potential to be one of the greatest achievements in cinema history just wasted. Decades of character development amount to NOTHING!!!","true":true}
