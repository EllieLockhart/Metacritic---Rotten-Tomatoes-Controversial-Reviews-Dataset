Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a real fan of Starwars since I am young (I saw many many times Episode IV\\, V\\, VI).\\nEpisode I\\, II\\, III\\, are not very good\\, but it respect the Starwars universe...\\nThis Episode VIII is the worst Starwars I ever seen\\, it don't respect the Starwars universe\\, it don't respect Luke Skywalker character\\, and don't respect at all the Starwars fans.\\nIt's really a shame to have done a movie like this.
