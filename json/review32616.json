Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is a phenomenal movie! It adds depth to the new characters of the sequels as well as breathes life into the old. The world expands as characters traverse throughout the galaxy showing off new and interesting worlds. The plot is solid with twist and turns that keep the whole audience full engaged and interested.","true":true}
