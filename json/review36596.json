Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie has useless scenes\\, useless jokes as the awful animals all the time being forced cute close to Chewbacca. The black BB8 only was shown as merchandising\\, it is not necessary\\, BB8 save the day magically. The boss is beat easily\\, Rey does not have a good performance\\, even the character is poor and fearful about her power which means as far as I know the dark side of the force. The arguments in the star wars universe are not consistent according to this movie. this is boring and without a sense","true":true}
