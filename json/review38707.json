Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writers clearly didn't know the workings of the universe. Y-wing bombers are replaced by ww2 style gravity carpet bombing in space. A senior admiral doesn't know how to lead her troops\\, dead people come back to life etc. For those who like their sci-fi with some consistent internal mechanics this is a major disappointment. To name another blatant break in established lore: lasers are fired like long range artillery\\, with the shells arching to the target.","true":true}
