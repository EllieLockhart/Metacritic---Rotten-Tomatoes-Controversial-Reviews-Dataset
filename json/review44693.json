Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Toxic Femininity in a Nutshell A Complete Mockery To Star Wars and Offensive too a True Fan\\,  Left me Feeling Bored & Bitter.This Film Had The Stage Set too be a Masterpiece but Spit on the Characters I Love .. now I know how it feels too be Triggered like a Feminazi. Well Done This Trash Red Pilled me and I Can see a New Hope Spreading Through Out the World.","true":true}
