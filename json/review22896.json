Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look I have loved all the star wars movies. This is not worth watching as the story telling is less about the actual story and more about the ideas the people in charge want you to know. I only give it one star for the Porgs.","true":true}
