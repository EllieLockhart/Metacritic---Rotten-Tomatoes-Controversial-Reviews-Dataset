Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely beautiful. This movie is so much more substantial than The Force Awakens. Very philosophical\\, and provides an insightful development of each of the characters that is very satisfying. If all you want out of Star Wars is battles and explosions\\, maybe this isn't for you\\, but if you want a space opera that as charming as the originals with the strong thematic material of the prequels\\, this movie is incredibly satisfying.","true":true}
