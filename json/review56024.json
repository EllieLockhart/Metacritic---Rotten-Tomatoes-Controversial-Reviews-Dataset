Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Since it's a Disney movie I will begin with: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious seeing Leia fly through space is really quite attrocious.\\n\\nThe movie looks good from a visual standpiint but the story is filled with plot holes and actually does something I've never seen before in a sequel. It actually manages to turn the entire plot of the Force Awakens into a giant plot hole. Spoilers ahead\\, you've been warned: So Luke has shut himself off from the force and went to Achto to be alone and die. However\\, the entire plot of the previous movie was about transporting a map only Luke could have left behind to find him? The other problem is Artoo re-activated in the Force Awakens because it was assumed Luke did it as that is the only thing that made sense. But alas no\\, Artoo woke up and just happened to have the rest of the map after years of being powered down just at the right time because\\, well\\, osmosis I guess (plot hole).\\n\\nThe movie is a plot hole filled story of OJ Simpsons white bronco chase in space that squanders every opportunity left by it's predecessor by answering all your questions with either nothing or no one. It's unimaginative\\, terribly long and slow\\, and throws out everything the previous movies set up to make Star Wars\\, Star Wars. Kylo is apparently the first emo Skywalker\\, I was waiting for him to bust out a skateboard and start listening to the Cure. As for Rey\\, the movie manages to make the Mary Sue criticism even more apparent as by the end of the movie she's supposedly the most powerful Jedi of all after 1 lesson (though Luke promised three).\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest problem was what they did to Luke. After 35 years of waiting to see Luke Skywalker they chose to neuter him. One of the most iconic\\, beloved\\, and anticipated figures in cinematic history and this movie actually destroys his character. Its a travesty on multiple levels but this movie should be avoided as in the end your left with Emo Skywalker vs Mary Sue going into 9 and the big problem is nobody cares about the fate of either. Ones a tantrum filled emo brat while the other is too perfect amd powerful to be believable. It's not that the movie is disappointing\\, it just drags and spends most of it's time destroying all that came before it. My only wish is that I could unsee this movie. Rian Johnson should never be allowed near a Star Wars movie EVER again.","true":true}
