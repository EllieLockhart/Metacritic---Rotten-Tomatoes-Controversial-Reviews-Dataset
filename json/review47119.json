Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a let down.  Everything interesting that JJ set up in The Force Awakens was promptly tossed away by Rian Johnson.  This was a bigger disappointment than Star trek V The Final Frontier.  What they did to Luke was unforgivable.  A low speed chase...not very exciting.  Lucasfilm had better find better writers... people who understand the mythological and anthropological roots of SW.","true":true}
