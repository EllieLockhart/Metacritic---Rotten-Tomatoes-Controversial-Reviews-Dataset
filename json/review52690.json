{"101487":101225,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the hate on this movie made me sign up just to refute it. The fact that the audience score for The Phantom Menace is higher than The Last Jedi leaves no doubt in my mind that something is amiss in the reviews being left. I love Star Wars\\, and nothing in TLJ was remotely as terrible as Jar Jar or some of the most god-awful CGI effects in cinema history which were seen in TPM\\, (which probably contributed to the use of puppet and not CGI Yoda in this film). \\nSo first off\\, if your issues stem from any sort of \\\"feminist agenda\\\" in this movie\\, or you're upset that \\\"every white male is a bad guy\\,\\\" just GTFO. We get it\\, the fact that you aren't seen as superior to all simply based on being a white man is tough\\, but seriously\\, maybe if you weren't such a shitty person\\, you wouldn't be so deeply personally offended at not having your ego stroked by TLJ. You are just showing that your own insecurities and fragile masculinity are more important than the storytelling at work in TLJ\\, and reflects the issues that cause your deep personal unhappiness much more present in your life than the time spent watching and bitching about this movie.   \\nNow for the movie itself. The first time I watched it in IMAX 3D\\, though the visuals will stand on their own in any modern theater. There were moments that had me rolling my eyes\\, and which lost a star for my rating. The Force Awakens provided a good setup for Rey\\, and so the lack of character development in this movie wasn't a drawback. I actually preferred the focus on Ben\/Kylo's struggle\\, and the relationship and connection between he and Rey. \\nI would have liked to seen a few more risks taken cinematically\\, but I think that this movie captures the human element of the rebellion better than any other SW\\, and while there is no definitive moment of victory like the Death Star exploding\\, there is enough of a conclusion to keep one satiated until the next installment. \\nLuke's storyline made absolute sense to me\\, and while Mark Hamill may not agree\\, loving a character often makes it far-too-easy to want to give them a fairytale ending. The problem with a film such as this is that you can tell a story just to please the fans\\, or you can tell a story that rings true\\, but often these two don't totally overlap\\, and in this case I think the right choice was made. The essential character traits of Luke that were introduced in the original trilogy laid the logical groundwork for where he is at in TLJ. Any psych 101 student could see Luke has gone through Erikson's stage of stagnation and is now in despair. Really\\, I think that this makes him the most relatable yet: a somewhat bitter old man whose life didn't turn out how he envisioned\\, who is angry about it\\, and who really just doesn't really want to care anymore. His efforts to topple the Empire failed\\, and rather than keep at it like his sister\\, he went to pout about it for a few decades on an island. It may not be how fans wish to see their idealized and relatable Skywalker\\, but in life\\, our heros often fall short of what we see in our minds eye. In the end\\, he came through\\, and once again provided a breath of hope to the rebellion. \\nOverall\\, I enjoyed this movie\\, and while Rian Johnson didn't nail it\\, he also easily topped episodes 1-3. As a huge J.J. Abrams fan\\, and having loved The Force Awakens\\, I am quite excited to see how the story is concluded\\, though I must admit that I'm more excited for Solo (quite possibly my favorite SW character) in the meantime.","true":true}
