Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson doesn't understand the Star Wars universe. Because of this the film was already doomed from the beginning. I expected this going in. Boy was I wrong. Not only does he not understand the star wars universe\\, he doesn't understand how to make a good sci fi movie. That's what happens when you get a rookie director and writer to do it.","true":true}
