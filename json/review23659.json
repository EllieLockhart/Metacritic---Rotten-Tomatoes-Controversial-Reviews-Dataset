Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love this movie!  Calls back to the days when Jim Henson was involved\\, but the characters are more complex and the graphics improved.  Rey's family line brings me hope.  My family enjoyed all of the new creatures\/worlds.  So happy I'm alive to experience this!","true":true}
