Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. Worst plot ever. Worst movie ever. Should be removed and Rian Johnson should be kicked out of Hollywood for murdering the most loved saga of all time. This is an abomination and an insult to Star Wars. It makes me sick","true":true}
