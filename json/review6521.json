Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissatisfying. Most of the movie just leaves you asking \\\"Why?\\\"\\, not out curiosity\\, but because there is literally no point to the events. It's like someone just picked out some cool concept art and strung it together without a purpose. But hey there was some cool lightsaber fights and the porgs were actually cute and funny. So 1\/2 star for that. Can't wait to see porgs with lightsabers in Johnson's new trilogy.","true":true}
