Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a casual fan\\, I am now more excited than ever about the future of Star Wars. In my opinion this is the very first good Star Wars. The others have all been fun to watch\\, but this was the first one that is actually a good movie. Its true that this movie is very diferent from the others\\, but that is a good thing\\, most Star Wars movies have been poorly written Space Operas. And I'm talking about the original trilogy as much as anything. I'm probably going to have to go back and see this one again in theaters. I haven't done that since The Lord of The Rings were in theater.","true":true}
