Of particular note is the different ways you can approach every single scenario\\, from stealth to the different weapons\\, or even melee (which is actually extremely fun).\r\rNow to get to the part that is apparently polarizing: the story. I personally find it a brave effort that is often profound. It's very visceral and made me empathize with characters in a way that I never thought they could do. Having said that\\, it is certainly not for everybody. It is full of pain\\, grief\\, and violence\\, and that can get exhausting for some. For those that are worried about the polarity in opinion\\, I think it is probably because the people that are upset wanted a continuation of the same story elements they saw in the first game\\, but were angry and confused when the game decided to take things in a new direction and explore different themes. My advice would be to relax and let the game tell you the story it wants to tell.\r\rMy 10\/10 score for the game is not to say that the game is perfect. No game is perfect. There are certainly problems with the pacing\\, and the skill trees and upgrades have not evolved enough\\, but these issues were never enough to detract from my experience with the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
