Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars anything since the Xmas special. Awful writing\\, awful  character development \\, terrible attempts at comedy\\, forced and preachy politics and a rehashed score that even the amazing (but inconsistent) light-speed scene cannot hide. Avoid.","true":true}
