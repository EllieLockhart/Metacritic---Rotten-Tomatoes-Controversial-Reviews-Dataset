Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all the peeps out there bashing\\, they need to get over the endorphin crash of waiting 2 years. This was a solid movie based in its timing. Ep 4 was 40 years ago! 40! I saw it in theaters. First movie I can remember. Star wars was always about the heroes\\, this one isn\u2019t. This one says it \u201c dead heroes\\, no leaders\u201d every episode was like some James Bond travesty where some hair brained idea saved the universe. This one follows more on rogue one. People really die\\, and not just heroes\\, everyone. Everyday heroes. Yes\\, we all chuckled when Porkins and his bucket of fried chicken gets shutout down. But does anyone chuckle during the bomber scene..... that scene drew me in and made me start watching seriously. This too had the hair brain plan\\, but it FAILS. the seemingly pointless one does.. not sure why she doesn\u2019t just tell Poe.... Leia flying... she\u2019s a damn Skywalker! It made me wanna cheer. If Vader can survive being melted\\, Leia can survive a few seconds in space.... and force pull her way to the ship... bottom line it was a good story\\, desperate\\, funny\\, jarring\\, and sad. Yes\\, we didn\u2019t have 10 hours to tell the story\\, Rey only got 3 lessons\\, ep 7 already made her a freakishly powerful warrior. We don\u2019t know how long she was there... weeks months... and don\u2019t worry about reading the massive canonical stories... the movies are we are supposed to know. Go see it. And yes\\, get ready for the endorphin crash... I was drained after seeing it. ","true":true}
