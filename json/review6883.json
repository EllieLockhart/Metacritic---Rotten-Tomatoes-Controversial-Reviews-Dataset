Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful. Thought it was going to be bad; it surprised me by being AWFUL.\\n\\nDumb-as-a-box-of-hammers plot\\, inopportune humor abound\\, old characters get offed unceremoniously and new ones are a whole new shade of bad. This isn't Star Wars. I'd say it was like Spaceballs II\\, but it wasn't even that funny.\\n\\nThumbs WAY down. Good jarb Disney. You did what nobody else could: you actually ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
