Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another subpar installment in the expanding Star Wars universe\\, boring first half and terrible storytelling...just stay out of range while nothing important or consequential takes place. Second half was much better but couldn't believe what I was seeing and not in a good way...sorry we doubted you George Lucas. I'll just have to convince myself this was non-canon and move on. Not at all excited for the Abrams finale\\, I'll see it but won't expect much. Think I'll go reread Dark Empire...","true":true}
