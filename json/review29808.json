Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right off the bat\\, this movie leads you on with disinformation; it's right in the title. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" makes this the only Star Wars film whose title lies to the viewer\\, and the rest of the film follows with as much respect for the audience. One of Luke's first lines continues in this now-established way of mindless and needless mediocrity: \\\"the Jedi religion.\\\" I may have missed where one converted to Jediism in the Star Wars universe...or did Rian Johnson actually think that the Jedi \\\"temple\\\" qualified the organization of a ubiquitous\\, non-faith-based entity (present a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away) to be a bona fide religion? I guess we'll never know\\, especially because this writer\/director doesn't have time to settle such questions as\\, \\\"who's that?\\\" and \\\"why did that happen?\\\" Such curiosities are the result\\, of course\\, of decades of Hollywood brainwashing\\, making people feel entitled to consistency and tastefulness. What Star Wars needed\\, after all these disposable years\\, wasn't further plunges into the depths of characters\\, unique concepts (e.g.\\, midichloreans)\\, political dynamics\\, or literally *anything* that may have existed or occurred \\\"back then\\\"; no\\, Star Wars instead needed anti-twists (i.e.\\, Rey's parents' identities and possible connection to shirtless Ben Solo)\\, utterly pointless and counter-intuitive side stories (e.g.\\, Finn and Rose's hapless and inconsequential adventure into the capital of the intergalactic fossil fuel and child porn trades)\\, and countless minutes of now-cliched space battles to distract the viewer from the fact that someone in the studio accidentally signed a blood oath to the cinema gods on the rough draft of the script for this mind-numbingly moronic and hollow Star Wars episode. It is awful not only because it is so disappointing; it is awful because it is also insulting to the intelligence. Don't watch this movie...or at least don't pay to watch it. $11 can take you somewhere much more gratifying\\, and just as out-there\\, with a trustworthy dealer.","true":true}
