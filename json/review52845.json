Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of the humor in the movie felt really out of place and the casino planet scenes were definitely the worst part. I did enjoy the Rey and Kylo scenes and didn't mind the ending with Luke. But the movie didn't feel as epic as I feel it should with a Star Wars movie. I feel more excitement now with the Marvel movies.","true":true}
