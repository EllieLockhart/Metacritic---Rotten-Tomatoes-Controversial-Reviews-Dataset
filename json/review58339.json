Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A different star wars film but for me at least it was both enjoyable and technically well executed. Some beautiful cinematography but also some out of place moments. It seems to me that many of the die hard star wars fans hate the film because it tries to push the saga forwards and tries to stop leaning on the characters and story of the original films and forge something new (which if you'll remember was exactly what Ep. 7 was criticised for not doing). \\n\\nRian Johnson is signed up to direct a whole new trilogy and I can see why Disney took such a liking to this film. Die hard fans are a big market for star wars films but so are kids and new audiences. Having all the new films lean on the old is not only makes for repetitive and boring story telling but also alienates new audiences that might not have seen the originals yet. And yes\\, you might say \\\"but you have to see the originals\\\" but there are plenty of kids out there that didn't grow up with them and maybe don't want to sit through 6 (now 9 or 10 depending on how many you class as canon) before watching\\, what is at heart\\, a Hollywood blockbuster. \\n\\nOverall\\, FOR ME\\, I watched the film once and was split at first but as it has sunk it and I've remembered the bits a loved and can't wait to see it again. Remember\\, transitions are hard but we'll live.","true":true}
