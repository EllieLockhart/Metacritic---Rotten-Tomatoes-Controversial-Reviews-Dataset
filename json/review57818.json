Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasn't impressed with the trailer.  Wasn't impressed with the movie either.  I went in hoping this would film would knock my socks off\\, but instead sat through 152 minutes of pure boredom\\, corny attempts at comedy relief\\, and diversity message shoving down your throat.  \\n\\nThe background stories were non-existant and the characters lacked any depth or connection to the audience.  How could Supreme Leader Snoke be so powerful\\, yet so weak as to not expect or detect the foul play arising in that god-awful scene.  Poe Dameron continues to remain uninteresting and General Hux was irritating and unconvincing of being a leader of the First Order.  He was more like a millenial given his rank so that he could have his fair turn being leader.  Don't get me wrong\\, I loved Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson in Ex Machina\\, but they have no place in the Star Wars movies.  \\n\\nI'd like to consider The Last Jedi as Star Wars 7.5.  Hopefully someone will reattempt Episode VIII properly...\\n\\nA 93% rating from the critics but a 57% score from the audience?  Smells like the critics were paid off....","true":true}
