Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The worst story I've ever seen in a video game. Destroyed what made part 1 great. ND set out in part 2 to force inclusion and alphabet identity politics upon fans of the 1st one. Gamers want to play games they don't care about that bs. Graphics are amazing though ND really lost what made the studio great when Amy and Bruce left. Druckmann and Gross need to be fired asap by Sony. Reviewer's are an even bigger joke\\, very few of them are unbiased when they're getting early copies and perks from studios. Check out skillups 25 minute review if u want an unbiased perspective of all that's wrong with this game.-----SPOILERS-----Writing an plot are kindergarten level. Joel saves the new ? Character Abby. Him and his brother then proceed to tell them their names and where they're staying lol.The new strong ? character brutally kills Joel then they force u to play as the new ? character for around 10 hours. Don't worry he or she has a fully stocked 24 hr fitness and bigger muscles than any of the males in the game.They then force to try to be sympathetic with Abby as u save children\/relive good memories of her crazy surgeon father that was wanting to dissect Ellie. I thought the decision to force players to play as the character that kills the most beloved character of the PS4 gen was the dumbest I'd seen\\, but it gets worse.There's a weird sex scene involving Abby and her boyfriend\\, which didn't need to be shown and afterwards I'm sure most players will be believe it's a man. There's Lev\\, played by real life trans person\\, that's trans in the game that kills her own mother lol. This game is all about forced inclusion and they wouldn't dare kill off any of the alphabet characters lol.I'll skip a bunch of garbage and get to the end. Ellie tracks down Abby to get revenge for Joel. She finds her\/him strung up and instead of killing her let's her down for a boss fight. Abby somehow managed to bite off two of Ellie's fingers. Yeah he or she is like the terminator with a Rottweiler jaw lol. Ellie then has her almost dead\\, but sees a flashback of Joel and let's her go lmao. So she kills hundreds of people to get revenge\\, pregnant women\\, probably kids too and let's the main villain go. ND should have a script at the end that says no trans or lesbian characters or people were killed during the making\/playing of this game. ND pulled one of the worst bait and switches in recent entertainment. They'll still a lot of copies the first month\\, hopefully word of mouth will kill it off. They sold around 20 million of part 1. This will be a standalone game with a patch on ps5\\, so they're gonna feel the lack of 2 sku sales. GameStop be ready because you're about to be flooded with trade ins of this garbage game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
