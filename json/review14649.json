Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have loved stars wars all my life\\, and I have seen and played bad movies\/shows\/games\\, but movie  is something else alltogether.
