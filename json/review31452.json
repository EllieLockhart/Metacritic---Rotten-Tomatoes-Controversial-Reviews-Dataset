Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some parts of the movie are very good and not like any star wars we've seen so far. We have some bold choices here .But some others are also the product of lazy writing and  left me a bit disappointed . Especially on the snoke part. What the point bringing a new big boss with tremendous dark powers in this universe just to end the story like this ?? The movie also suffers from severe cuts I believe. The light settings are sometimes really too much ( dark dim and red in first order ships in case you didn't get they are the bad guys )and sometimes beautiful. Some 3d effects are not what we would expect from the studios . \\nI still enjoyed the movie and I'm waiting for the next one to judge the thing as a whole.","true":true}
