Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever made\\, central premise of slow ship was garbage\\, if the central premise was bad\\, but the rest of the movie was fine it still could have been a reasonable movie.  But the rest of the movie isn't fine\\, when it's not arranging illogical space battles\\, it's besmirching historically beloved characters\\, add a sprinkle of poorly executed slap stick humor and you have a mess fit only for colleges teaching students what not to do in movies.","true":true}
