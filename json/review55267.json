Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is a good movie. But as a Star Wars fan it ruins the entire franchise for me it feels rushed And so many other so me other things but I\u00e2(TM)m to lazy to type it. Trust me there are still parts I like  for example  Yoda.\\n This is a good movie but not a good Star Wars Movie","true":true}
