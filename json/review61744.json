We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"tldr:  Terrible story\\, worse gameplay\\, hollow diversity\\, pretty graphics\\, do not buy.\r\rI'm writing this as the credits roll on the game\\, nor did I watch the spoilers leaked online.  If you enjoyed the first one\\, you will more than likely utterly despise this one.  Joel and Ellie are not the same characters; straight-shooting and hardened heroes no longer describe them.

If you enjoyed the first one\\, you will more than likely utterly despise this one.  Joel and Ellie are not the same characters; straight-shooting and hardened heroes no longer describe them.  What you are left with are similar but significantly altered shadows.  Like another man said below\\, I checked out 2 hours in\\, and never came back.\r\rThe rest of the story is just... bad.  There's an attempt to make you care about other characters in the game\\, but you end up not because of everything surrounding them.  You try to keep playing\\, and then you realize that you're not having fun.  You're just watching a train wreck that hit a bus while carrying a nuclear bomb that set off a volcano that froze the planet in endless winter destroying all life.  It's. That.  Bad.\r\rThe gameplay is worsened from the previous one.  There's an effort to make combat more combaty\\, but I remind you that this is a mostly a stealth game.  Stealth\\, depending on the difficulty\\, you may never use.  Listen mode is utterly useless now (unless they are right next to you).  Enemies will change patterns depending often you reset a point (this is more frustrating than enjoyable).  You have to continuously turn the camera to keep hitting the same enemy.  Your first skill tree is useless; the last 2 are your best.  The game will not let you turn off tutorials until you beat it and prepare for condescending 'hints' when you die.\r\rThe diversity in the game is paper thin and hollow.  And it feels more like checking off boxes saying\\, \\\"Look who we have in the game!\\\"  versus actually doing the work to weave their stories into a compelling narrative.  Diversity is not a bad thing.  Half-assing it is.   A black character is not just black\\, a lesbian is not just a lesbian\\, and a jewish person is not just that.  They are more and that should have been explored through the lens of that world.  You will see almost every race in here.  You will see almost every marginalized 'major' group in here.  None of which contributes well to the over all story.\r\rThe art and graphics are solid.  Game looks beautiful.\r\rDo not buy this game.  Borrow it from someone\\, or watch a Let's Play.  The ending is remarkably awful\\, and there is no satisfaction in finishing it.  The Last of Us Part II was an artsy attempt to change the first; it succeeded.  Neil Druckmann said that this game is about hate.  He is right about that; you end up hating the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
