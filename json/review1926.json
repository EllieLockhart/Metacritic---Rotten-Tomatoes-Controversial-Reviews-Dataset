Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As Kylo said \\\"Let the past die\\\" Most of the so called \\\"Experts\\\" are upset because practically everything old is put to rest. We've had nearly 40 years to enjoy the original trilogy. Its time for a new generation. New heroes\\, new rebels\\, new villains. For the first time ever\\, we're FREE from Lucas' story-telling by rhyming. For the first time in 40 years\\, no one but the director and writers will know whats going on. Im thankful for all the old adventures\\, and EXTREMELY excited for all the new ones to come.","true":true}
