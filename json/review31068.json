Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I wasn't a big fan of force awakens despite its great cast and stunning visuals it just felt very femiliar to me the last Jedi however does not and is in my opinion one of the rare sequels that is better than its original it's picks up right where force awakens left off it follows the rebellions ongoing war again the first order ray on an island asking for Luke's help and being trained and fin is of on a side mission with new character rose while kyloRen\/Ben is stil off trying to deustroy what remain of them rebellion the film has some unexspexted comedic value and in my opinion a great performance from Hamil as well as some great twist in plot and the same brilliant visuals as it's predocseor over all it's fun well written and more original and in a way breaks away from Star Wars formiler providing us with something fun funny visual dazzling eye candy with a great story and cast","true":true}
