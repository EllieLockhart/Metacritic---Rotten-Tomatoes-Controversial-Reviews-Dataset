Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals but plot holes big enough to fly The Avenger through\\, nonsensical sub-plots\\, and characters acting (and dying) in improbable ways for the most part.  An exhausting film for the true Saga fan.","true":true}
