Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first movie review ever.  As a huge Star Wars fan who's seen every movie in theaters multiple times\\, I'm the guy who defends Phantom Menace.  All I can say is that when your twin 12 yr old boys\\, who are also huge fans and said they were more excited for this movie than XMas\\, leave the movie feeling (and it crushes me to say this word) \\\"disappointed\\\" that should tell you something.  And that's how I feel....disappointed.  \\nTLJ successfully takes every major theme that they built up and hyped and flushes them right down the toilet.  Tedious\\, pointless and flat out boring story lines (Finn and Rose's mission - good thing they kept that 30 minutes of stupidity in the movie because they couldn't have cut that or anything).  Not even a single light saber \\\"duel\\\" to help define it and keep our attention (first time in franchise history and that's with a 2.5 hour movie).  It's a constant buildup with no crescendo and when it tries too....it falls incredibly flat and does nothing for the story.  It's heartbreaking to say this about a Star Wars Movie.  So much potential\\, so many directions and things you could have done and you put out this....thing.  \\nWe left TFA excited and pumped for the next installment the minute we left the theater.  Needless to say\\, None of us have any renewed sense of anticipation for the next one.","true":true}
