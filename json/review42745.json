Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was honestly worse than The Force Awakens. The plot was confusing and had one or a couple holes in it. The movie was slow and it had almost no action in it. Luke Skywalker isn't what he used to be\\, but (!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!)\\nwhen it was revealed Luke wasn't actually there fighting with Kylo Ren and he was actually creating a copy of himself keeping Kylo Ren busy\\, that was cool. The movie had some cool parts\\, but it isn't enough to salvage the entire movie. Honestly\\, I am a bit dissapointed","true":true}
