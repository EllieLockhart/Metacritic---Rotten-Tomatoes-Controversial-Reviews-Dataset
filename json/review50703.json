Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"9.25\/10. Rian Johnson as writer\/director was the right choice for a franchise that has long struggled with taking risks. 'The Last Jedi' is the most creative and un-Star Wars like film you could hope to see\\, but is all the better for it. Johnson introduces a level of gravity to the saga by deviating from franchise formula\\, where the good guys beat the odds\\, save the day\\, and are relatively unscathed\\, and instead explores the folly of heroic recklessness. No victory achieved by the heroes is anything less than pyrrhic. The characters fly by the seat of their pants\\, as they often do in the Star Wars universe\\, but suffer grave - and fatal - consequences as their spontaneous rogue plans fall apart. The true heroes of this film are the characters who remain calm and steady\\, who realize the costs of slap-dash foolishness\\, and know when the time is right to make sacrifices. In this way Rian Johnson has weaved together a cautionary tale\\, one that brings the franchise to a darker\\, more mature\\, and necessary place.\\n\\nDespite this and other radical departures from the Star Wars formula\\, Johnson is able to retain the fun\\, humorous\\, visually dazzling spirit instilled by his predecessors. Mark Hamill's return as Luke Skywalker was a highlight in terms of his acting - hilarious\\, grizzled\\, and yet tortured - and of character development. In fact\\, Johnson nearly matches the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back in advancing interesting character arcs. Rey's training is reminiscent of what Luke faced in his youth\\, but carries a heavier emotional burden. Poe and Finn spend the film learning what true heroism is\\, and what crossing the line into hubris can bring to bear. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren may be the most consistently engrossing performer and character\\, as he is constantly facing internal battles that manifest in rage\\, but with desperation\\, fear\\, and longing percolating under the surface.\\n\\nThis is the most beautiful Star Wars film to date. We've come to expect great special effects from the franchise\\, but the cinematography has reached a high point for the series\\, offering homages to previous installments while seeking to leave it's own distinct mark. The scene with story's ultimate sacrifice is breathtaking\\, it's stark beauty serving to brilliantly reflect the greatness of the sacrifice that bore it. Additionally\\, the air and light saber battles are among the best in the series\\, expertly choreographed and framed. \\n\\n'The Last Jedi' is everything you could hope for in a Star Wars flick\\, ironically by throwing many of the characteristics we most identify with this franchise out the window. Johnson derailed the franchise from the safe\\, albeit entertaining\\, tracks J.J. Abrams intended\\, ultimately setting it on a course for daring and depth that Star Wars hasn't charted in decades. It's a shame that Star Wars fans are so toxic - they may very well cause studio executives to shift the course back\\, and perhaps rob us of an incredible finally. Only time will tell.","true":true}
