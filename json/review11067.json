Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's the long and the short of it\\, Mark Hamill\\, Carrie FIsher\\, Harrison Ford and others are still alive. They were alive in real life and in the movie\\, killing them off early in this and the last movie was a huge mistake by a terrible company\\, Disney. Nobody wanted that\\, and I felt it during the movie. Disney should be taken apart stick by stick until it's gone. Why would i go back to see the rest\\, i really don't care what happens next.","true":true}
