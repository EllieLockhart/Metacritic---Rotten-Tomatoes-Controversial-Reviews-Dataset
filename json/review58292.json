Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it! When I exited the theater I told my friend I felt like a kid again. No other star wars movie made me feel that way since I discovered the original trilogy in the early nineties. The story is just great\\, a fresh take on the SW universe. And yet everything that makes SW is there: politics\\, space battles\\, the Force\\, lightsabers... I'll keep spoilers to a minimum\\, the best scene in my opinion is when Ben and Rey battle the praetorian guards together. Clearly\\, until the conclusion of that battle the lines are blurred. Light side\/dark side are the Force and nothing is certain until the charachters consciously choose which path they will follow. SW VIII is truly epic and fittingly it gives us HOPE that the conclusion to the current trilogy will surpass this one.","true":true}
