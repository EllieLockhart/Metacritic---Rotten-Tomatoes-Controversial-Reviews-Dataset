Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have very mixed feelings about the Last Jedi. There were awesome moments and then some that were just bizarre and felt out of place. I did not care for any of the character arcs or the overall plot. Flashy effects were used to cover bad writing. The overall product is a poor story full of plot holes. I left the theater wondering if I had watched a spoof of Star Wars. ","true":true}
