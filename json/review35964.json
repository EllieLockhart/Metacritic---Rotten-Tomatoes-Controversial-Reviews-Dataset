Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi may have the highest highs of the franchise\\, but some of the lowest lows as well. Certain characters got moments to shine such as Rey and Kilo Ren with breathtaking cinematography and action sequences. However many other characters such as Finn\\, Rose\\, Captain Phasma and General Hux fade into the background and lose what fans loved about them in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, Finn and General Hux especially. Overall The Last Jedi is an enjoyable Star wars film with lots for fans to enjoy\\, with a bit of forgettable filler mixed in between the fun.","true":true}
