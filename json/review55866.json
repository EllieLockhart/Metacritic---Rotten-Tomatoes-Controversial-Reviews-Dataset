Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Racists and sexists aside\\, this is the most aesthetically perfect Star Wars film. The script is a master class in reversals\\, and the editing is so air tight\\, you could seal a breached hull with it (what?). It understands the implcations of the word \\\"balance\\\"\\, and doesn't mistake that for meaning \\\"light should always win.\\\" Yes\\, it stopped being a myth. It became complicated\\, and instead of seeing black and white\\, TLJ sees grey areas. It sees life. It was beautiful\\, emotional\\, raw\\, and exciting. There were a few choices that I don't necessarily agree with (you know the one). But the story is not yet complete. Give it time. On a personal level\\, I haven't been this obsessed with Star Wars since I was 13.\\n\\nStop telling this film what it needs to be or should have done. Accept it for what it is or write fan fiction if it didn't go exactly your way.","true":true}
