Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now that this franchise killed my last emotional attachment to it\\, I can stop giving Disney my money. TLJ entertains\\, but is basically a commentary on Star Wars as opposed to a Star Wars film. RIP SW.","true":true}
