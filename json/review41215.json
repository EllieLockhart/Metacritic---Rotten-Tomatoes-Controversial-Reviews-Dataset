Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"... This movie have so much wasted potential it make me mad \\nit could have become one of the best movie of the Franchise with a better story line\\nbut no..... they decided to just waste all the potential they were having\\ni dont want to give any spoilers but FFS i could have made a better story then this","true":true}
