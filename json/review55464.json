Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More Brainwashing and Propaganda from Hollywood\\n\\nHollywood abused and exploited a storied Star Wars franchise to pathetically attempt to brainwash society with its moronic\\, crude and blatantly obvious political undertones. Instead of staying true to the Star Wars roots\\, the creators of this film opportunistically infused this film with ridiculous\\, condescending and contradictory messages about female empowerment and multiculturalism. I came to watch this film to be entertained. Instead\\, I was nearly puking on the matriarchial messages that Hollywood has been spewing for the past few years now with other movies such as Rogue One\\, female Ghostbusters??\\, Wonder Woman\\, etc.\\n\\nTo give you a few examples - Admiral Holden(?) - Female - is lauded as a hero for sacrificing herself and going down with the ship. On the other hand\\, Finn and Poe are portrayed as dumb\\, reckless\\, douche-bag fools for willing to sacrifice themselves and scolded and slapped(!) (where are the outcries of physical abuse?) by female characters (whom I thought were absolute jokes). \\n\\nDespite Hollywood seeking to be \\\"progressive\\\" with its millennial\\, multi-cultural cast\\, it continues its racist streak of not casting any Asian men (save for Master Yoda of course). \\n\\nThis film was an absolute waste of money and time and I urge you all to not watch this movie because otherwise\\, you are just throwing more money into the racist\\, feminazi\\, hypocritical\\, decadent and greedy machine known as Hollywood.","true":true}
