Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was a great film. It was very different for a StarWars movie \\, but it was a good different.  I was pleased with the story line and the detail out into the film. I am a die hard Star Wars fan and think this film will attract a whole new generation of fans.","true":true}
