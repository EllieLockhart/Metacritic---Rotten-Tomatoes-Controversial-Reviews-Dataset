The first game delivered a story contained on itself.\rBut I think that its a nice and worth sequel that leads to many emotions to the player such as anger\\, sadness\\, joy and despair.\rI totally loved it and I hate it to have those low grades of people that haven\u00b4t played it at all.\rThe only thing that comforts me is the thought that public isn\u00b4t ready yet to such powerful and intense story which in a future I think will be far more appreciated\\,\u2026 Expand","true":true}
