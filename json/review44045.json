Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ felt more like Star Wars than TFA. It was more in tune with characters\\, explained a good deal of questions we were given by TFA and it had a lot of great character creation and development.\\nThere were a couple of irritating points where characters were surprisingly incompetent or situationally stupid\\, or stupid for the sake of comedy that was seemingly out of character\\, but these points were few and far between.\\nThis movie created a lot of good theories and hopes. One of my top five in Star Wars movies.","true":true}
