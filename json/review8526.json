Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First ever post or review!!!!\\nThis is was the last Star Wars movie I will ever watch.\\nI have read every book\\, old and new cannon. I have seen every movie and watched every cartoon. The Last Jedi made no sense! The story was horrible! The Force Awaken left storyline holes that the books and the Last Jedi never addressed. Made they should have kept one director for the whole trilogy. The directorial differences from each movie really shows. The new trilogy movies don't add to each other like you would think. \\nThe Last Jedi movie left characters undeveloped\\, added more hole to the story line from the Force Awaken in the new trilogy and even the CGI was weak at time.\\n\\nI don't know if the critics on rotten tomatoes got paid off to give this movie a 93% but fire them all\\, they either don't know star wars or have got paid to to give this movie good review!!!!","true":true}
