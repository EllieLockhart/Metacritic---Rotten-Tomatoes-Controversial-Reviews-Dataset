Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was such a badly written movie I think it destroyed the franchise. The pacing was terrible\\, intense scenes were ruined by slapstick comedy. Heroes weren't heroic to the point that this movie somehow made me dislike Leia.  The bad guys \\\"The First Order\\\" were ridiculously incompetent\\, with a massively oversized fleet being the only thing making them intimidating\\, like the Force Awakens never happened and there base of operations wasn't just destroyed.","true":true}
