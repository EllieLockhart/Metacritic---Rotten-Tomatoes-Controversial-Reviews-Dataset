Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie brings the characters in all new directions. Adds to the myth of the Force and even shows much more than we imagined can be done with the Force. Some amazing moments. The hate this movie is getting is from a group out to purposely hurt the review of the film. It's not bad. It's just disappointing to people who had their own theories about how things should go from them. ","true":true}
