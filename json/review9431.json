Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"God I hated this movie. Amazing acting and visually very good\\, but the plot is horrible\\, the storytelling is weak\\, and the characters seem incredibly inconsistent between movies. I feel like Rian Johnson put more effort into distancing himself from everything The Force Awakens set up than he did creating a plot line\\, characters development \\, and anything fans would care about.","true":true}
