Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bad movie and the first hour is great but if you enjoyed any of the questions proposed in The Force Awakens then be ready to be disappointed. Rian Johnson sees these as nuances to his movie and treats them like so. It didn't ruin my childhood or anything that dramatic. It did ruin the new movies and new trilogy. I honestly have no desire to see anymore new star wars movies. I Will! I'm not going to lie to you or myself but not excited in the least. I watched the movie 3x and waited 3 months before I realized I was just constantly making excuses for the movie and had Phantom Mencace syndrome. Luke Skywalker himself has even stated Rian Johnson made this movie for himself and not the fans. It shows!","true":true}
