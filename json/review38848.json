Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They have managed to ruin Star Wars. Congratulations Disney for making this the worst movie imaginable\\, one has to try really hard in order to reach such poor standards. Shame on you for ruining my all-time favourite saga.\\n\\nFans\\, please save your money and decency\\, this movie is not worth watching. I truly wish I hadn't  seen it.\\n\\nAnd also...I see a recurring theme in the reviews. The public give this movie very poor ratings and yet somehow official reviewers try the best to counter that. It seems that Disney can spend money to influence opinions but can't do a half decent job making a star wars movie :\/","true":true}
