Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this addition to the franchise. As a Star Wars fan of over 25 years\\, this was a really refreshing change. The movie was fun\\, engaging and I really loved all the characters. There were some moments that I'm not 100% sure about\\, but the movie had so much to offer I need a second helping to full digest it. It's very much a movie for a younger generation and it's about the NEW cast\\, for me that's wonderful as the old cast had their time in the sun and they are helping to world build and bring in these new ones in the best ways possible. Let go of your hate\\, and see this movie as soon as you can.","true":true}
