Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok. Nothing special. The scene with Leia waking up in space after being blown out of the command ship was farcical. To be honest I was disappointed.  Not a film I came out of the cinema buzzing about","true":true}
