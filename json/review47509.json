Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What kind of parody is this?\\n\\nWhen I went to the cinema\\, I was looking forward to watch a Star Wars movie\\, it was not necessary for the film to reinvent something\\, for me it was not necessary to see nostalgic moments\\, nor see things that I had seen\\, I only wanted\\, at least see a good Star Wars movie\\, I do not understand how they did it\\, but they wasted 2 hours and a half for this?\\n\\nAs a fan I have to give a rating to the film\\, of course\\, relating it to others in the saga\\, I think that with words I could not describe the great disappointment that I feel\\, I have never underestimated the work of the critics\\, It has always seemed to me that they do a serious job\\, except in some cases\\, but there is no way that this film has such a positive assessment\\, and fans are realizing that something is definitely not right\\, but in a planet far far away\\, certain mouse has already pulled the strings to make sure to squeeze every last dollar of faithful believers in a saga that certainly died when its creator turned its back.","true":true}
