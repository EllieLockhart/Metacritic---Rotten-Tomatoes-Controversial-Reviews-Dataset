Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy\\\" - you're f***ing kidding me? There was no honoring involed. It ruined Luke\\, it scrapped everything J.J. Abrams wanted to foreshadow for this movie. It has no continuity not even with it's own trilogy let alone the saga's legacy. TFA also scrapped what George Lucas wanted to do.. This movie has nothing to do with Star Wars and everything to do with what's popular in the politically correct world.","true":true}
