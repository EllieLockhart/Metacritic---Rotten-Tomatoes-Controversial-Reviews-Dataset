Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ set up so much for Rian to accomplish\\, and he just threw most of it away. Probably the most eventful and action packed Star Wars film\\, so it makes a bit of ground up there for me. Biggest disappointment is that it took Luke almost the entirety of a film to learn to become a Jedi and Rey learns to become one in 3 minutes. Also\\, the Finn and Rose arc didn\u2019t need to happen at all\\, and felt just forced upon us. Overall\\, I see it as better then the Prequels\\, but worse then the originals and Force Awakens by a decent margin","true":true}
