Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really\\, really wanted to like this movie.  As a very long term fan -- and VERY emotionally invested in the entire saga\\, I was incredibly disappointed.  Rian Johnson ruined one of the best characters in film history\\, and literally burned the entire story line to the ground.  (I get it\\, that was the whole symbolic point of the Yoda scene.)  It was a mistake.  And the move was riddled with one head-slapping\\, squirm inducing moment after another:  Super Leia\\, BB-8 piloting an AT-ST (whah?)\\, Luke throwing away the lightsaber that SOMEHOW found him after falling from Cloud City\\, Luke's projection can't be touched by a lightsaber\\, but somehow he could bring solid Falcon die to hand off to Leia (double whah?)\\, etc\\, etc\\, etc.  This movie was a mediocre film\\, and a really bad Star Wars film.","true":true}
