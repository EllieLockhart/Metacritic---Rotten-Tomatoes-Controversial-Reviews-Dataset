Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was vastly disappointed with this movie as a fan of the original trilogy this is not the way I wanted to see the storyline go. Major let downs with character story arcs and come on people are going to see Luke Skywalker do battle\\, not Rey or Kylo. With an audience score in the 60% range I see I'm not the only one.","true":true}
