Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had many friends tell me this movie was amazing. Although I had high hopes seeing the 91% review. I also saw many one star ratings even though it is at 46% for audience score. I just watched it and was amazed\\, how much this is a great Star Wars film. Looked at reviews again and can easily tell someone keeps making profiles to give it 1 stars. The critics were right to  give it 91%. I guess the 1 star reviews are people who hate good stories and have the imagination of a donut. The 1 star ratings could be a little more creative to hide there tracks? Sadly that will never change how great this movie was. I am happy to see what happened to the story of Star Wars.","true":true}
