Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars ever. Unforgivable what they did with Luke. Just made to sell toys and push SJW and feminist agendas. Just a bad story all together. Too many plot holes leaps in logic and common sense. And for everyone saying oh people are just mad because fan theories didn't come true are so off base. People are upset because the story they came up with is garbage. Didn't need to match the theories just needed to make sense and be a good movie that respects Star wars canon and lore. This movie spits in the face of real fans","true":true}
