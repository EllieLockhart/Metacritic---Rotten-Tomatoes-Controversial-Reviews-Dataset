Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tone was wrong and all over the place... Storylines abandoned from the previous film... The story itself was bloated and an insult to my intelligence... The lore was bastardized and now serves as cannon that is not only an insult to its beginnings as a franchise but an utter slap in the face to fans... This movie made me long for jar jar!!! Original characters are casually discarded and completely out of character... This movie was an insult to fans and if I could give it a negative rating I would... Lucasfilm needs to listen to its fans or this franchise will die... Another side note... Stop trying to make star wars the mcu.... You need a feige and he's booked...","true":true}
