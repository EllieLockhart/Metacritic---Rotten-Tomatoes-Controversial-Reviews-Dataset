Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give this film 0 stars\\, but the fight scene with Ren and Ray was pretty awesome. Also\\, one of the best intro scenes in a Star Wars film. Overall not a film this franchise should be proud of.","true":true}
