Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this were the first act to the trilogy\\, it would have been really interesting.  The problem is it isn't\\, its the second act. And rather than expanding on the plot from The Force Awakens or answer some of the questions we had\\, a lot of the build-ups are completely abandoned with new ones being created in its place. therefore\\, as a second act\\, it fails to act as a smooth transition to the final film. So in the end what we have plotwise is a second act that goes nowhere. This is why The Rise of Skywalker had to do The Last Jedi's job in the opening 3rd of the film.  And that is really unfortunate because The Rise of Skywalker is a good movie and would have been even better if it had a competent second act.\\n\\nWith that said\\, however\\, I did enjoy certain aspects of The Last Jedi. The visuals are absolutely stunning\\, the effects department have done a fabulous job mixing practical and digital effects to create an inhabitable world that is believable to the viewer.  I also enjoyed the performances\\, yes even the new characters were likable and enjoyable to watch\\, especially Poe.  But overall what we have is an ineffective second act which really drags down the rating\\, which is why I can't give it any higher than a 3\/5.","true":true}
