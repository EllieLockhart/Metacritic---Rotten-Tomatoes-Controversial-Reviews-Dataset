Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals including effects were good. That's it! Thematically\\, it flies in the face of the OG Star Wars\\, making his Luke's hero's story arc less meaningful.  The plot holes and bad subplots don't make sense. Bad writing and bad humor doesn't help. The supposed hero(Rey) has no hero character development from failure to success. You got a Mary Sue problem thus it's hard to identify with your main protagonist\\, making it hard to inspiring\\, much less captivated and entertained.","true":true}
