Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good guys are now stunning\\, slapping and treating each other like enemies. Luke was willing to burn books (like the Nazis!?!) that he ... didn't even read?\\nStar Wars used to have a wholesome and positive message about the value of friendship\\, dedication and assiduous practice among other things.\\nVery little in this movie makes sense.\\nThis is the third time I have tried to post a review.","true":true}
