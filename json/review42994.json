Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible - we were so excited as the Force Awakens - although similar to A New Hope - was excellent! The Last Jedi was such a mess - really a big fan of Rian Johnson and Looper that expectations were high. Not interested in the next one now as the Disney machine is in full \\\"force\\\".","true":true}
