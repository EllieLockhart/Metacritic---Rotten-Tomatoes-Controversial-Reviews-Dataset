Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars film ever. This is not a blind or paid review. I don't know how much money did Disney spend to receive a massive positive reactions to the movie when clearly is the worst piece of s**t SW movie ever.\\n\\nNo character development\\, easy and lazy storytelling\\, terrible and lazy writing\\, bad soundtrack\\, bad CGI\\, horrible dialogue and script\\, stupid jokes... Disney has ripped off the heart of this franchise and turned it into a Marvel-like empty shell action movie.\\n\\nSTAR WARS IS DEAD!","true":true}
