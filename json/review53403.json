Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Not at all what I expected after The Force Awakens. Poe's character was abrasive throughout the movie and Finn and Rose's scenes together felt. Dry forced. It's unfortunate that Finn took such a back seat to this addition to the franchise. So much action with very little progression in the plot and scarce character development besides Rey\\, Poe\\, and Kyle Ren. Most unfortunate.","true":true}
