Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gawd awful movie. Don't understand how critics are praising this. Star Wars aside\\, the movie is a mess. Overly long\\, filled with plot holes and unnecessary story directions. Lack of real character development. Emotionally uneven -- the humor was incredibly forced and ill-timed. B-movie-campy-bad in terms of humor.  And the story\\, being praised as new and different\\, was just a mashup of Empire and Return of the Jedi.  This film is a mess an\\, honestly\\, I don't know what they're going to do for episode 9.  The franchise isn't salvageable\\, at this point.","true":true}
