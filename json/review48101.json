Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie has some beautiful scenes\\, the writing and overall plot end up retroactively weakening episode 7 and leaving little hope for episode 9. Plot lines from 7 are subverted for the sake of being subverted\\, others are dropped entirely. Rather than replacing them with equally interesting plot\\, ep 8 replaces them with a boring grind of a storyline that moves at a snails pace. Ultimately nothing new is created\\, and everything old is destroyed leaving episode 9 to work with scraps. As a self-contained movie\\, episode 8 is riddled with plot holes\\, useless subplots\\, cringey dialogue and scenes\\, strange pacing\\, and writing that ends up creating moronic situations which any fool with half a brain cell could have solved. Rian Johnson has completely failed Star Wars fans and casuals alike.","true":true}
