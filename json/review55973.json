Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rubbish.\\n\\nFirst off\\, I'm not a bot\\, or a hack or a right-wing extremist\\, I'm a Star Wars fan that was sucked into Disney's 'big farewell' for Leia marketing tool and was expecting a dark\\, middle act that throws all hope into peril and leaves us wanting a thrilling victory in the final film. It doesn't do that.\\n\\nSo many elements of this film are wrong - what they did with Snoke\\, Luke and Leia were all wrong. Snoke was brilliant in this film\\, for the moments he was in it\\, and his end was unexpected and unwanted. The big villain killed so early might be 'brave' for critics\\, but it was actually stupid. The bad guys are now led by General Harold Lloyd and a petulant man-child.\\n\\nThe Imperial humour was so awkward and misplaced it made what should be clearly defined bad guys just things to laugh at. \\n\\nThe whole main plot point in the middle with the cruiser stranded\\, and being slowly followed by gigantic imperial ships was boring\\, and tactically and strategically flawed. The little adventure that Finn goes on to the gambling place was so dull and reminded me of the prequels. And here we have the clearest political statements of the film - not that I am against these views\\, but this is a sci-fi fantasy not a political drama. This is supposed to be escapism\\, and all these scenes here were just meh.\\n\\nAnd at the end\\, what is the point of another film? It was like we are left with a dozen or so resistance fighters\\, and maybe 50 first order\\, it's nothing more than a big pub brawl. We've now lost all the interesting charactors - the original trilogy stars\\, and Snoke\\, and are left with three rather boring new leads. \\n\\nOh and don't even get me started on Rey. With zero training she is already seemingly one of the greatest light-sabre fighters of all time.\\n\\nThe music was good though\\, and the special effects.","true":true}
