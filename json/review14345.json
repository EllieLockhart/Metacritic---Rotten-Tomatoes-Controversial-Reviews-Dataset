Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess I'm part of the problem; I went to see this the weekend it opened\\, taking my whole family.  Why?  Because it's a Star Wars\\, obviously.\\nThis will not happen again.\\n\\nWhy did i hate it?  Firstly\\, the humour; The scene with Hux and Poe completely undermined the menace of the first order\\, reducing Hux to a bumbling fool.  Second\\, the weird admonishment of Poe\\, a character we the audience (or certainly the male contingent) are invested in\\, for doing his job properly. I mean\\, what difference would withdrawing sooner have made?  There would just be more guns and Tie Fighters to destroy the \\\"Bombers\\\".  Third\\, the bombers themselves.  They moved stupidly slowly\\, they were a huge target\\, they bombed using gravity(!) (or magnets according to apologists\\, which begs the question why they couldn't be launched at the enemy from afar).  This was all within the first two minutes!\\n\\nWhat a waste of all the setups from episode 7; JJ's mystery boxes\\, neatly wrapped\\, waiting under the tree for Christmas Morning\\, eagerly opened only to reveal NOTHING OF VALUE INSIDE.  Rian Johnson thinks this is storytelling\\, creating a twist\\, but it's just a set-up for disappointment.\\n\\nThe list of problems is endless but the biggest travesty was weaponized hyperspacing\\, a tactic that could have destroyed both Death Stars or\\, worse still\\, been a more formidible weapon for the Empire than the Death Star's themselves!!!\\n \\nI hated Holdo most of all\\, she wasn't a \\\"strong woman\\\" in the least\\, she was written as AN INCOMPETANT LEADER who the movie itself tells us to mistrust\\, then we are suddenly supposed to like\/love without there being time for us to adjust; it's just jarring.\\n\\nI can only imagine that the quasi-unanimous critical acclaim is due to a combination of the critics pussyfooting around the fans\\, saying what they think the fans want to hear\\, and fear of The Mouse - i.e. negative reviews equals press-screening bans (this actually happened to the LA Times; Google it).\\n \\nAll this means is I no longer trust critics\\, which by extension also means Rotten Tomatoes\\, and I will never\\, ever\\, make the mistake of watching another Star Wars on opening weekend.\\n\\nBTW\\, the onslaught of sock-puppet reviews beginning June 11th hasn't done much to move the needle except incite the true fans to restate their case.  If Disney spent as much money on story-development as they did on gaslighting\\, we might actually have a great franchise.","true":true}
