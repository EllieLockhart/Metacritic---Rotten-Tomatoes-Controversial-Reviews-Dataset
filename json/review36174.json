Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was extremely boring\\, tedious and drawn out. Almost painfully so. It had some cool moments\\, and some good things about it...but it's just glacial in pace\\, and the villains aren't interesting enough to sustain it.\\nStar Wars is SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. This movie is NOT fun...it reminded me of the battle star galactica reboot\\, and I do not mean that as a compliment.\\nToo much Kurasawa\/Ford\\, not enough Flash Gordon\/Erol Flynn.\\nOh\\, and Vader is totally Luke's dad.","true":true}
