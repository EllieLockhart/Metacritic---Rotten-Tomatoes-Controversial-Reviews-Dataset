Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like a giant firework that you are so excited to light off and it turns out to be a fountain disguised as heavy artillery. I could not be more disappointed. At least I'm not hyped for 9 anymore. Thanks for nothing Disney","true":true}
