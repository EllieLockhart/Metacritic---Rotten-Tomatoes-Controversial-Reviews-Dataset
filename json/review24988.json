Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My one big and over riding failing with this film is that 50% of what happened did not need to happen. \\n\\nIe\\, if the admiral woman had just told po her plan\\, then the whole casino bit would not have happened then the whole betrail bit would not have happened and the bit on the planet and luke's death would not have happened\\, all i learnt form this film was the same as in any other film\\, just open your mouth and tell your allies your plan!\\n\\nThe story was weak and feeble\\, and i really did not like it\\, and why o why not use the your ship as a warp weapon in the 1st place\\, why let the two smaller ships die  why not jump them at light speed  into the enemy\\, never mind the stupid thing of falling away when they ran out of fuel\\, they would have just stopped accelerating its space\\, there is no inertia! \\n\\nin fact why aren't all wars\\, just people jumping engines in to each others fleet!","true":true}
