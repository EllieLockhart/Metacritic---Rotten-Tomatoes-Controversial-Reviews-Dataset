Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been reading a lot of the negative fan reviews\\, and I have to say that I am shocked so many people are having such a strong negative reaction to this film. I saw the original as a 1st grader in 1977 and fell in love with Star Wars.  I just saw the movie and LOVED it!\\nSo glad they went in a direction OTHER than some cookie cutter plot to mirror fan expectations of what a Star Wars movie should be.  I thought the direction they went with Luke was refreshing and that SO WHAT if Rey is a nobody!!  The Star Wars galaxy is so much bigger than just some chosen few Skywalkers!!  I hope they keep the plot twists and surprises coming in the future films in the franchise.","true":true}
