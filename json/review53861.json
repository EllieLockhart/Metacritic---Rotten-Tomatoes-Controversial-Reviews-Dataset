Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly after watching the film\\, I can say that much like The Ford Awakens was like New Hope version 2.0. The Last Jedi became as coherent as an old copy of Empire Strikes Back bound up in an old VHS player. Massive lacking of any story telling\\, we find the great Luke Skywalker son of Anakin Skywalker as self loathing hermit. Rey is become a Jedi master by basically fighting Kylo aka the universe's worst Sith with no help from Luke. The movie was clearly reshot because in the epic climax battle or lack of we see Mark Hammil dyed his beard and hair\\, while earlier it was grey. Yoda's cgi is very poorly executed as Disney still refuses to bend to the will of the fans in bringing back the puppet. The new Star Wars films are a funeral processing for the original characters. As Disney kills them off we find that we are going  enter not a galaxy far far away\\, but a storyline with all the makings of a Fast and Furious film in which we the audience wonder when is this going to end. The Last Jedi is a good Netflix date night movie. Only because at some people you will give up on this bad movie and focus on making out with your girlfriend.","true":true}
