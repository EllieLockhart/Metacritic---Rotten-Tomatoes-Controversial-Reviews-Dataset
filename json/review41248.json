Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolute garbage\\, enough said. I mean\\, for crying out loud the opening scene was literally a space version of a B-17 bombing run. Complete with the opening bomb bay doors (IN SPACE!!!!!) and the German opposing side. I feel cheated and disappointed that this was a Star Wars film.","true":true}
