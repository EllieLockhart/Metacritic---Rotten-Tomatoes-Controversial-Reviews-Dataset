Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly disappointing.  \\n\\nThe film either ignores or slams shut much of the interesting potential from Force Awakens while providing mostly tensionless action and irrelevant subplots.  The pacing is incredibly awkward; the movie feels like it lasts about half an hour longer than it should.  The ultimate effect is to feel tired and worn out leaving the theater.  I had never associated tedium with Star Wars before.  \\n\\nIt is a real shame because so many images and performances are so good\\, but the script and editing are just beyond hope.  I really wish I could have seen the movie the critics apparently got to\\, since it sounds like quite a good time.\\n\\nSadly\\, what I saw ends up better than Attack of the Clones\\, but only by a hair's breadth.  Phantom Menace and (especially) Revenge of the Sith are playing an entirely different ball game.","true":true}
