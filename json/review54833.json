Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a competently made movie\\, but the overall plot was terrible\\, it moved the series in a poor direction.  It also didn't follow the rules of the universe as previously established.  Basically  the quality of acting and production and what not\\, was fine.  But the story\/plot has GOT to be better for the amount invested in this skill.","true":true}
