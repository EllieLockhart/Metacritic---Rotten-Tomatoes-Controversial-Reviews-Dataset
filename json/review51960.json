Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh\\, interesting take at the Star Wars Universe with a message full of heart and import for our times. The film makes several important choices with character growth\\, plot revelations\\, and the nature of the Force that it will be interesting to see if Abrams continues or walks back in the final film. The film has some great \\\"wow\\\" visual moments throughout that help capture the essence of the space saga. Unfortunately\\, the Finn subplot falls short at certain moments\\, and greater visual creativity could reasonably be asked for in regards to some of the new worlds that we encounter. Do not listen to the lazy and somehow contradictory \\\"fan\\\" reviews that paint the film as A.) a simple remake of Empire Strikes Back or B.) ruining the Star Wars canon; see it for yourself with an open mind and make your own call!","true":true}
