Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No where near as good as the Empire Strikes Back\\, let\u2019s get that out of the way immediately. Snokes death was very anticlimactic and pointless\\, we deserve a better back ground and more character development in him. This was obviously Rian hating what JJ did in the previous film. Also\\, zero chance Ray came from \u201cnobody\u201d she\u2019s too strong with the force. Lineage has always meant a lot in Star Wars. With that being said this was an excellent Star Wars movie. Kylo Ren is probably the most well thought out villain in the Star Wars cannon. He is the first multi demential bad guy we\u2019ve ever had. ","true":true}
