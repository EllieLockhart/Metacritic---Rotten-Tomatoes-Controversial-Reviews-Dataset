Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many people have said that those who dislike this movie must have had an exact idea of how they wanted the plot to go... This was not the case. I loved Force Awakens and was beyond excited to see this movie. It was a poorly written story with weak character development. New characters were boring and felt out of place. Rey and Kylo's connection was the only enjoyable aspect in my opinion. Adam Driver does a great job. A few scenes looked strong cinematically but disappointed overall. The casino storyline was horrible and looked ridiculous. Leia's Mary Poppins moment made me cringe... Can't even begin to get into the plot holes and character inconsistencies. Very disappointing.","true":true}
