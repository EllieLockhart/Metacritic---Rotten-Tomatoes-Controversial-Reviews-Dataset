Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m sure The Last Jedi did right by my childhood or whatever\\, but that\u2019s not very important. What\u2019s more important is that it did right by my current and more informed standards (and it continues to improve every time I see it.) Kids watch the same low-quality cartoons over and over again with no discretion. So\\, I trust current me more than child me in terms of what\u2019s \u201cgood\\,\u201d because child me would have loved it regardless. This movie really got what I love about Star Wars.","true":true}
