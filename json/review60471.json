Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's a difficult game\\, emotionally.

It's not a \\\"nice\\\" story with a happy end on a white horse.\r\rThe graphics is just gorgeous and very detailed. You find a lot details just for a single scene\\, or something you just stumple upon details that most players will miss. It makes the world believable. There are some flaws with enemy encounters\\, though\\, like some encounters where you think no way a real human would survive this\\, but hey\\, it's a game. The levels are very linear\\, sometimes very noticeable\\, sometime not\\, most of the time it's just fine and I didn't mind much. Overall the sneaking\/killing works very well and can be quite nerve wrecking (in a good sense).\r\rI do understand it's a polarizing game\\, for various reasons. You might not like some characters or the way the story develops\\, but it is in my opinion a good\/well-told story (even though it's a cliche revenge story). Most main and secondary characters are neither black or white\\, they have likeable traits and dislikable flaws. It made me care for characters\\, hate others\\, think about them and their situations\\, I liked a lot of things in the story (and side stories) and there's few for me to complain about. The game really made me forget my surrounding and sucked me in at times\\, which is all I want of a game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
