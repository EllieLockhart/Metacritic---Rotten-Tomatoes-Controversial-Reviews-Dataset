Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has its moments and there are many scenes which are incredible. But the most of them are only possible because of the charactres we already know and love. It brings many new aspects to the star wars universe  especially to the force - some of them are good\\, others less. There are many plot twists and the storyline was pretty unpredictable which makes the movie really exciting\\, but some of them are not really satisfying in my opinion. All in all it was not bad\\, but in comparison to other star was movies rather weak.","true":true}
