Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I usually don't mind when I spend my money on a bad movie; I go for entertainment value. However\\, this movie wasn't bad in the conventional sense\\, so I'm here to share my opinion.\\n\\nThe visuals and audio felt very Star Wars\\, but don't let that fool you into thinking that's what you're watching. Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson took a near flawless setup for greatness and botched it. Star Wars is a film series largely focused around the Skywalker family... From episode 1 through 6\\, they are key to the plot line. After introducing a new set of main characters\\, Disney decides that's not the direction they want to go. The Skywalkers are obsolete\\, character development of the new cast doesn't matter\\, and \\\"the force\\\" becomes some sort of magic for those who believe in it enough.\\n\\nThis movie takes a beloved series and takes it in a wild direction for the worse. If you're a newer fan\\, say The Force Awakens was your first Star Wars film\\, you might enjoy it. Anyone who's been a longtime fan or appreciated the original trilogy won't leave the theater feeling satisfied; or excited about the next film.\\n\\n1\/2 Star for effort; might have left a 3 Star if they did the legacy characters justice\\, but they certainly did not. You can find out for yourself\\, but i'd wait till it's free.","true":true}
