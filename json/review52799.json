Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot has been said. This is not the movie anyone was waiting for. It has taken Star Wars into the wrong direction. It fails as a film\\, a sequel\\, and as part of the Star Wars universe. It may be successful as a marketing exercising relaunch of the franchise but it will not be the franchise Disney bought. Nor have the longevity they bought in. The demographics will not be there in time. As it is it may be that most of the loyal fans will reconsider their alliance to the franchise as it stands.","true":true}
