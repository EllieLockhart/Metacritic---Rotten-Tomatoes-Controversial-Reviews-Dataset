Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrific as a stand alone film. Disappointing they didn't have a clear roadmap with the new trilogy. This trilogy is missing a  cohesive storyline and director. Perhaps a Rian Johnson dedicated trilogy would work better. Definitely over angry fan boys claiming their childhoods are ruined by something happening to them in their adulthoods. Good film\\, lame fanbase. Better stoned.","true":true}
