Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The whole Finn\/Rose plotline seemed to exist only to give those characters something to do. it did nothing to drive the movie forward. Parts of this storyline were cartoony and reminded me of the worst parts of the prequels. The rest of the movie was awesome. Great lightsaber battles\\, space battles and some truly applause worthy fan moments throughout.","true":true}
