Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yooo.. This movie was garbage.. Even 30 yr. Fans were upset with the final product.. Now to be fair\\,  it had moments\\, but it wasn't worth sitting through 3 hours of dialogue for 10 minutes of action.. They showed everything in the highlights.. I am a fan of Star Wars\\, but this was not worth my money or time.. Wouldn't even watch this joint on my fire stick..  I'm sorry\\, but this was bad..","true":true}
