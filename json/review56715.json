Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had exactly two redeeming qualities: Poe's character growth arc from brash pilot to considerate leader\\, and Luke's character growth from despairing recluse to formidable contributor.  But the movie fails in every other way\\, including Luke dying at the end; under-using Leia; making Leia's shining moment into something best described as \\\"I survived being blown into space\\\"; The whole casino city escapade was a huge waste of time; Finn's part in the movie is a huge waste of time; The long chase scene is stupidly contrived and fails as a backbone for the story; And Rey and Kylo weren't really interesting.  Oh and we're left with no where to go from here for Episode 9.  What happens next?  I hate what Rian Johnson did with Episode 8.","true":true}
