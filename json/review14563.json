Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Fan of Star Wars my entire life.\\n\\nI even loved the prequels\\, but this movie killed my interest completely for the future of Star Wars\\, to the SW fans that liked this all the best to you I am glad some of us liked it.\\n\\nFor me Personally Star Wars is now Episode 1-6 plus the TV shows\\, good luck fucking up Star Wars further Kathleen\\, Rian and Disney","true":true}
