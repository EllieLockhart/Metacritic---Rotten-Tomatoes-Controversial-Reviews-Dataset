Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete script train wreck disaster. A meticulously crafted deconstruction of Luke Skywalker's persona and the Stars Wars universe overall. A pathetic attempt to force new empty characters through uninteresting and uninspired plots. The movie that made Star Wars like every other movie. The movie that managed to unmade Star Wars\\, packed in a flashy\\, beautiful package with no substance whatsoever. Ryan's Jhonson regurgitated contradictory mess.","true":true}
