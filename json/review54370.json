Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have so many things to say\\, but I'll say this: Effects and the porgs were great. The story lines were disappointing and weird in so many ways especially those surrounding Luke and Leia\\, which I may add was the reason most people (especially fans) went to see the movie in the first place.","true":true}
