Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just like the force awakens\\, the last jedi continues the tradition of giving disappointing ends to the audiences most beloved characters. With an incredibly slow first half\\, and a plethora of plot holes\\, the last jedi fails at capitalizing on the potential it showed during a handful of the movies key scenes.","true":true}
