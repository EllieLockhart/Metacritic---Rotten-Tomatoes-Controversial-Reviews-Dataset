Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just a disaster. Worst movie\\, which could be ever made under Star Wars title. All good things which were in TFA were totally wasted. Beloved classic characters are raped. All stories of the new characters are completely failed. No cool action at all. Stupid dialogs (George\\, please come back!).\\n\\nThe story is just one plot hole itself. Rose and Fin subplot is pointless. Even Luke and Rey subplot is pointless! This man\\, played by Mark Hamill (which is totally not our Luke Skywalker) didn't even train Rey\\, he didn't absolutely nothing! Snoke is wasted\\, droids can now drive vehicles\\, flying Superleya\\, completely pointless Rose and this new kamikaze admiral characters\\, milking space cow scene (Seriously? They actually think that we waited 30 years not to see cool action scenes with Luke\\, but to see how he milks some alien CGI crap??? ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS???). And I have one more question: Rebels said\\, that they have fuel only for 16 hours\\, but we clearly see that Rey spent a couple of days on this island minimum. WHAT THE FUCK???\\n\\nBut what totally ruined this movie for me is what they made with the most beloved character in the whole saga for a lot of Star Wars fans. I'm talking about Luke of course. They try to tell us\\, that the most inspiring character\\, our hero with whom we all grew up with\\, tried to kill his own nephew while he was sleeping\\, refused to help his friends and sister\\, when they needed him most and then died for no reason. It left me totally heartbroken\\, and I refuse consider that man as Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nThe whole trilogy is ruined for me. I'm not any interested to know what are they going to show us in Episode 9. It's not canon for me. Just a disaster.\\n\\nP.S oh\\, in that \\\"next Star Wars episode\\\" there are no lightsaber duels and even proper gunplay action scenes at all. But who needs cool action in Star Wars\\, it's better to show us space \\\"Mom jokes\\\".","true":true}
