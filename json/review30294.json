Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"scenes that were brilliant lead to no consequences or change. The major points in the plot was to distinguish the efforts of all in previous films as failures beyond measure\\, it ripped the spiritual heart of star wars and laid it on a pyre\\, watching it as it burns\\, Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker deserved more\\, George Lucas' brought myth making to the forefront of a generation\\, and the prime lesson of the last jedi was...kill the past(which is the path to the dark side). as a side note no matter who you may think the jedi were\\, they would never advocate book burning.","true":true}
