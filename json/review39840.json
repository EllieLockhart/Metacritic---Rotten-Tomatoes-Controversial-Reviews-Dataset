{"101487":181891,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a star wars movie.  That brings certain expectations.  For example\\, a your momma joke by Poe Dameron?  How is that good to set the tone for the rest of the movie?  All it does is break the immersion.  \\n\\nI wasn't much of a fan of Force Awakens either\\, which is part of what makes me give this a 2 star rather than  3 star and I will explain.\\n\\n1.  Rian Johnson wants us to forget the past and embrace these new characters.  Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, that girl who dropped cringe lines constantly.\\n\\n2.  The problem is the character development was horrible for all of the new stars in the original movie\\, and they were done even worse in this installment.  Which for me means the third movie in the trilogy can't possibly be salvaged\\, and I will wait for more spin offs to decide if I will spend more money on this franchise. \\n\\nExamples of what I feel is poor character development;\\nRey defeats main antagonist in 1st movie in direct combat\\, Kylo Ren is absolutely not intimidating as an enemy in any way.  He basically comes off as an angry brother in a complicated family squabble.  I get that they didn't want another darth Vader\\, but even Kylo Ren killing Han Solo couldn't make him interesting.  \\n\\nKylo Ren.  In this movie\\, Rian SOMEHOW managed to make Kylo Ren even less interesting and more pathetic.  He is easily fooled\\, LIES about killing Snoke rather than accept he did it\\, and that he is now the chief dude in charge of the imperials.  It's just all a sign of weakness and makes me miss Snoke as he was the chance to have a big bad guy to weaken the plot armor Rey is carrying around.  Killing Snoke would have been just fine if this movie had made Kylo Ren out to be a serious contender.  But it didn't.  I don't think it's the actors fault.  The lines are pure cringe and his story is just bad.\\n\\nI agree that Rey not having a tie to any Jedi bloodline would be interesting\\, but in this case\\, SHE IS SO BORING of a character\\, it just makes there that much less to care about.  Other than her being an absolute beast in the first movie\\, I think she actually could of had much more of a role in this film than she did.  The entirety of the Poe\/Fin\/cringe girl could have been skipped for this.\\n\\nFinn and Poe:  Rather than being the spiritual successors to characters like Han Solo\\, they are just boring and sad.  It feels almost like Rian goes out of his way to make male characters helpless and worthless.  Finn chases a fruitless mission\\, fails at every step to everyone he encounters\\, and is embarassed at the start walking around in some leaking clown suit.  He was just treated like a clown rather than a legitimately contributing member\\, and if he had sucessfully sacrificed himself to destroy the cannon at the end\\, it would have actually been a redemption of his character.  But he was spared that by the cringe girl\\, which just exposed to me there was not going to be a saving of his pathetic fumblings\\, and basically sealed how I felt about the film.\\n\\nI won't even discuss Luke Skywalker because that part was just boring\\, and because of the poor character development I found myself WANTING Luke Skywalker to live just because I couldn't stomach the idea of watching a third starwars movie with Poe the bumbling cocky moron\\, Finn who is a clueless weakling\\, and Rey the god who will save the day.  I HAVE NEVER EVEN LIKED LUKE SKYWALKER ! LOL\\n\\nIn summary\\, I will give you guys a spoiler to the third movie in this trilogy that we all know will go down this way:   Weak Kylo Ren the not very scary bad guy will throw temper tantrums and either convert to the good side or die\\, Rey will win\\, her plot armor is even stronger than NEO from the matrix\\, and Finn will be the \\\"lovable fumbling incompetent idiot\\\" and loyal sidekick to Rey.","true":true}
