Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since the new hope first came out. I enjoyed this one\\, maybe not as much as rogue one or the force awakens but thought it was good. Let your preconceptions of how Luke should act go and just enjoy the ride.","true":true}
