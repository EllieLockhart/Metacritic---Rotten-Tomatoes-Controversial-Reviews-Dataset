Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were great\\, couple funny parts but on the whole it was a disappointment.  Wasted characters\\, plot holes and really stretching belief is required (gravity in space?!?!)   Essentially I felt insulted as a Star Wars fan. I am really surprised critics are giving such good reviews\\, just from the predictive movie traps and pandering it does it should get a lower rating.","true":true}
