Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very heartfelt and hopeful film. This film took risks and cared for character development. I loved the new characters while also enjoying the new relationship between Rey and Ben Solo. Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rose gave the film a sense of adventure and heart.","true":true}
