Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars in many ways is like poetry\\, character arcs and events ripple in rhythmic pattern. And each episode of this saga acts as a stanza\\, carrying the story forward but also resounding a similar rhyme from the previous stanza. To craft poetry is not simple and to bend the reliable rhyme is even more challenging. However\\, The Last Jedi achieves this masterfully. Episode 7 was criticized for being a copy and paste of Episode 4. And while I love The Force Awakens I myself have written about this concern\\, stating that Episode 8 and Star Wars in general would have to evolve and grow. Simply put The Last Jedi did that.\\n\\nThis stanza of Star Wars bends the rhythm in so many daring and brave ways. This film pulls themes and events from both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. There are numerous story beats that are similar from those films in The Last Jedi\\, however\\, the final resolutions or consequences strike vastly different than their respective counterparts. The outcomes are unpredictable and shocking leaving lasting impressions even many hours later after leaving the theater.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a maturing of the franchise and to mature means taking risks. Rian Johnson was the perfect choice for this direction. The Empire Strikes Back made many decisions that made the story of Star Wars more than just a sequence of action driving scenarios. That film gave our heroes growth and change through character arcs and told us a more drama written narrative\\, one with heart and substance. The Last Jedi is that same step. Our new protagonists have their own set of challenges that push them in evolving directions. The life threatening situations that The Last Jedi has the heroes face will test you on how much you care about these characters. And it passes that test every time. I can genuinely say after watching this film that Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and even Kylo are characters that I have an emotional place for. \\n\\nStar Wars is a poem and it's stanzas tell great tales of good versus evil\\, redemption\\, loss\\, temptation\\, and family and it is all told in epic rhythmic fashion. The Last Jedi is a brave and bold stanza that delivers with high emotional impact through it's storytelling\\, risk taking and of course visual splendor.","true":true}
