Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film full of ridiculous plot contrivances shoeing that Disney is more concerned with milking the brand than preserving the integrity of the franchise. TLJ's plot points\\, especially those concerned with Luke\\, do nothing but retroactively destroy the OT. Moreover\\, none pf what was set up in TFA is explained. Rey is still just as much of a Mary Sue as she ever was. No character development\\, and in fact\\, we learn that she's got no special lineage\\, nor Jedi training\\, offering up ZERO explanation for her masterful abilities. Abilities which make Luke and Anakin\\, who trained for years and had a prophetic connection to the Force look like total scrubs.\\n\\nThis is Disney and Kathelyn Kennedy spitting in the face of everyone who ever loved Star Wars. RIP our hopes and dreams. Nothing George ever made was as bad as this.","true":true}
