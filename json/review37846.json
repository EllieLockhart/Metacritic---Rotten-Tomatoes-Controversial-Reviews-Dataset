Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some things that were great about this film but just much more that were bad.\\nThe direction they took Luke as an old mopey hermit that milked space cows on a daily basis. The humor they tried to inject missed so many times (opening scene). The completely useless storylines for Finn\\, Rose\\, and Poe.  I can certainly understand not wanting to rehash Empire Strikes Back as there were complaints that Force Awakens was a rehash of A New Hope\\, but this was a miss.  It seems as if once Disney got a hold of the property they intended on flushing all the old characters quickly and hastily so they could make way for \\\"their\\\" characters. I was incredibly excited to see this one as I was with Force Awakens.  I love Star Wars but to be perfectly honest\\, I don't know if I'll see Episode 9 in theaters.","true":true}
