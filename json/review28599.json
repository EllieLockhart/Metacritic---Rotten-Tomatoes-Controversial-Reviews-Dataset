Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the worst Star Wars movie to date.  Completely breaks all established lore and world building within the Star Wars canon.  Characters have bad dialogue - REALLY bad dialogue.  Kind of writing that makes you roll your eyes constantly.  Its a shame\\, since the Force Awakens really wasn't that bad.  What a horrible way to send off Luke\\, Han\\, and now Leia.  Get your act together Disney and Lucasfilm.","true":true}
