Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is visually stunning and uses a great mix of CGI and practical effects. Unfortunately that's the only thing it has going for it. The plot is stupid\\, characters act out of character. Plot holes\\, continuity errors and head scratching dumb moments are rampant. What really aggravates me about this film is that Disney and Rian Johnson had every opportunity to make an awesome Star Wars film and simply chose not to.","true":true}
