Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has always required a heavy suspension of disbelief\\, but this film requires a suspension of brain cells. A larger space ship that can't catch up with a smaller space ship... in a straight line in space. No one thought to turn on the hyper-drive? Audiences that waited years for Luke Skywalker to show up to a fight... nope. He just kinda dies. And then there's the Yoda appearance. Seriously? Whatever effort was placed into this movie\\, none of it was spent on thought. An over-long\\, hardly-fun insult of a franchise that just proved\\, unlike its interminable rebellion\\, it actually can't go on forever.","true":true}
