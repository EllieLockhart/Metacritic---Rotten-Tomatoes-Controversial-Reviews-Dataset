Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why critics are giving it a 9 out of 10.  I found the plot to be really dumb and the plot threads to be confusing.  Characters were shallow\\, dialogue was like reading a script\\, and everyone just seemed to be trying to ride on the \\\"Star Wars\\\" name.  I could talk for hours about my issues with the film (which I have) but I wanted to make my first ever Rotten Tomatoes score JUST BECAUSE I felt there is no way this should be getting 92%.  This is heading towards prequel levels in terms of quality.","true":true}
