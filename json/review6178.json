Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney finally made it clear that it wants fans for decades to star wars away from the franchise. disrespect our only weapon is to reject the Disney canon as official. The final scene is a slap in the face of the fans\\, symbolically representing that the future come out to kids - sell toys boys!!!!\\, the nerds died cowards like Luke. horrible.\\n\\nGood sci-fi movie? Yes.\\n \\nGood star Wars movie? Never! Never! Never!","true":true}
