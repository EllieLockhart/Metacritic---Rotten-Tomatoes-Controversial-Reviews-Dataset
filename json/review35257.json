Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good points:\\nThe movie is entertaining with some good visuals.\\nThe bad points:\\nIt is full of nonsensical plot holes and poor writing\\nCharacters act out-of-character \\nRey is like Wonder Woman with super powers and master jedi warrior without any training - it is not believable\\nLeia can fly through space\\nMale characters are ridiculed and treated like cowards\\, blundering fools\\, hotheads\\, etc\\nBattles don't make sense\\, why do the First Order ships chase the 'Rebel' ship to run out of fuel instead of trapping it and surrounding it.\\nSnoke turned out to be an empty random villain.\\nFin is treated like a joke \\nThere are so many flaws in the script and story telling that you can't count it.\\nRian Johnson basically destroyed Star Wars with poor writing and an illogical script","true":true}
