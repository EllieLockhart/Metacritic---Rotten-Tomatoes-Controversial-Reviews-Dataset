Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie as a Star Wars fan\\, I enjoyed TFA and am a huge fan of the OT. I felt that the movie started with a plodding drag that I just couldn't get past\\, but then the story built and built and built until everything came to a head in a wonderful way. \\n\\nThe overwhelming feelings of disappointment\\, loss and failure piled on until that bright \\\"Rey\\\" of hope shined brightly at the end. \\n\\nI cannot wait to go back and see it again.","true":true}
