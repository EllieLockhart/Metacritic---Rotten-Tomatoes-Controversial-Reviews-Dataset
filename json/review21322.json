Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see The Last Jedi last night and I loved it.\\n\\nI know some fans will be critical because it goes to great lengths to repeatedly and deliberately subvert expectations\\, but that's exactly what I liked most. Sure it was sometimes uneven\\, but for the first time in ages I saw a Star Wars movie where I had no idea what was going to happen next. As a result it was exciting in a way the series hasn't been since Empire.\\n\\nGO\\, now\\, before you are spoiled.","true":true}
