Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was very well done and Mark Hamill did a phenomenal job. However I was forward to a big and there was none especially with Rey I thought her parents would someone special but all that lead up to nothing!!\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e","true":true}
