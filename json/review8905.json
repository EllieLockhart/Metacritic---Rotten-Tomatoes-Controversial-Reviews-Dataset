Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Found it missing the magic that Star Wars brought forth. The feeling of family and fellowship is gone. Replaced with a over abundance of slap stick comedy\\, un original story lines\\, and over commercialization. I will see the last one in this trilogy to see it though and hope JJ Abrams does a better job. ","true":true}
