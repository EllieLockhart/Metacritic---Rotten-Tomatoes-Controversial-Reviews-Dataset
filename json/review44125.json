Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To anyone rating this crap above 7\/10 i bet you'd love to watch it again and waste 30 min of your lives with the goddamn awful and boring casino plot\\, enjoy the waste of good\\, intriguing characters by killing them off without any background\\, no character development at all from the other ones\\, a frickin star wars movie WITHOUT A SINGLE LIGHTSABER DUEL!! and waiting 30 years to witness legendary Jedi master Luke goddamn Skywalker not giving a single lightsaber swing. WTF?! Taking bold decisions in a movie just for the sake of it is not good directing when you sacrifice coherence and disrespect years of lore and hype building. And don't even get me started with the lame rebel plot that did absolutely nothing for the story. Man take that useless casino\/rebel crap and the movie is absolutely the same! I love star wars\\, I love the OT\\, I love some things about de PT\\, but I thinks since Disney got the franchise it has been nothing but shit after shit\\, RogueOne\\, TFA\\, they had their moments\\, but ultimately boring\\, derivative and so wrong about the Force. They erased the amazing Extended Universe to give us this underwhelming crap? Shit. At least we got the best soundtrack since episode I and III.","true":true}
