Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You have half the audience expecting to somehow rehash nostalgia that they had in the seventies as children\\, which is\\, whether they want to face it or not\\, impossible\\, and the other half a young group of people who want to capture that magic the older half had by seeing their own generation represented in the star wars universe... But the old crowd tears everything apart for not being 70's and for the young crowd getting to enjoy being the kids that they desperately wanted star wars to return them into.\\nIt's really never going to be possible to make everyone happy. JJ made the force awakens a complete clone of a new hope to satisfy the older crowd. What did they do? They trashed it for being a clone. Rian says alright\\, let's make it original. Trashed again. They're seeking something that they can't ever attain. Star wars won't make you ten again. Get over it. Let the past die. Open your mind\\, try something new. \\n+Originality\\, plot twists. The force awakens never surprised me. It was really nice. \\n+Amazing action scenes\\, graphically stunning\\n+Character depth\\, Adam driver in particular\\n+Amazing score\\, as always\\n+Giving the Force back to everyone\\, not just those blessed with lineage or midichlorians\\n+Long but satisfying and complete.  No cliff hangers. Thank you. \\n\\n-Full star for screwing Luke like that. Yeah\\, I entertained and enjoyed the new spin on his character\\, but his death was incredibly lackluster and disappointing. I get that his character couldn't have stayed. He would have upstaged everyone else\\, but still\\, it should have meant more. He meant so much to a lot of people\\, including me.\\n-Half a star for the minor plot incontinuities\\, such as never explaining to us who Snoke was (maybe it's just irrelevant) and why Rey has an insane aptitude with the Force now that she doesn't have lineage on her side. The silly scenes like Leia's space flight\\, the scene with Luke milking an alien just to tear down his image\\, Kylo Ren \\\"force texting\\\" Rey shirtless.","true":true}
