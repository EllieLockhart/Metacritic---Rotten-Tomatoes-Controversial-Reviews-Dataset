Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea why others have given this film such a low score.  There were definitely some moments in there where I was surprised by the choices the director made\\, but this movie definitely stands up against most of the rest of the franchise pretty well.  There are definitely some twists and turns\\, and the visual spectacle is pretty tremendous.  I would say this film has a lot of rewatch value.","true":true}
