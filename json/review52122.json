Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After such a good restart with The Force Awakens and then Rogue One this is such a disappointment. So many jarring parts such as the Mary Poppins scene and so many others\\, wasting good characters and failing the spirit of the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
