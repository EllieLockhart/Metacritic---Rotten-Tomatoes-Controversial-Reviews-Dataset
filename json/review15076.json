Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater having mixed opinions. There is a lot of things to enjoy in this movie\\, but it just left me wanting more. The main story really felt like an after thought and that setting up things for the next film seemed to me the main focus. The action scenes we're visually stunning. But sadly its really over shadowed by sloppy writing. I'd recommended seeing it\\, but don't go in expecting something as good as The Force Awakens","true":true}
