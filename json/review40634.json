Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst SW movie ever made. I saw it on Opening Night and it singlehandedly destroyed all of my SW hopes and dreams.  I've been lost and wandering in a brave new world where the SW of the past that was spiritually big is gone.  It has been replaced by something that looks like SW but is not SW.  This is like if aliens saw a SW movie and decided to make their own version.  They would put in all the trappings of SW\\, but not understand the essence of the universe or characters.  \\n\\nThis film is an abomination and should be destroyed. I will never breathlessly wait with anticipation for a new SW movie again. I have sworn an oath to now read all the spoilers as soon as possible and let others waste t heir time and money on this drivel. Curse you Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, JJ Abrams\\, and\\, above all others\\, Rian Johnson\\, for ruining Star Wars.","true":true}
