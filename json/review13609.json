Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt this movie had a lot of great 'stuff' in it\\, all of which portrayed sort of poorly by Johnson. I was disappointed to see someone other than JJ Abrams do this movie because the Force Awakens hit so many of the boxes that made for a great adventure movie as well as a stand alone Star Wars movie. \\nThere was little chemistry between the characters and most of the scenes were a tense build up to a very quick and unfulfilling climax.  \\nThe Last Jedi felt sort of like a cat walking on it's hind legs. Awkward.","true":true}
