Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved the movie! I am 49 and have seen every movie in the Star Wars franchise multiple times. This movie is extraordinary. I loved the evolution of Rey and Kilo Rhen\\, Po and Fin as characters. This is a new day for Star Wars\\, a complete revitalization of the franchise. ","true":true}
