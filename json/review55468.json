Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"most depressing star wars tale.The acting except for Mark Hamill and Andy Serkis's Snoke was generally bad. what happened to these young actors from the last film?  Kelly Marie Tran was ok in a throwaway role\\, the rest look like they are phoning it in. Bad script probably . There was no reason for the casino diversion except to waste time. The film needed serious editing \\, way too long and badly paced. not as god awful as the prequels but much worse than the original 3 and the last one which i thought was pretty good fun. Last Jedi dragged. Where they will go with the story now is anyone's guess\\, maybe that was the point. not disappointed by the change but by what could have been.","true":true}
