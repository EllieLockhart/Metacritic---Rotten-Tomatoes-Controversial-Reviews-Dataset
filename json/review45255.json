Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"* UPDATED: After seeing it again I liked it better and have it one more star. *ORIGINAL: Not what I hoped for and definitely not what I expected. I left the theater thinking I missed something and saying to myself maybe I need to see it again because I had an empty unfulfilled feeling. BTW NO ONE clapped at the end of the movie. That has never happened at any Star Wars film I\u2019ve seen on opening night. ","true":true}
