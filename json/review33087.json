Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subscribed to RT only to leave this review. By far the worse Star Wars movie ever. Long\\, boring and disrespectful\\, both towards the original trilogy and the previous movie.\\nThe high votes of the tomatometer shows how the critics are heavily influenced by the fact that it is a Disney movie\\, no way so many people could not see all the enormous flaws this movie has.\\n\\nThe wors part of all is that the director of this movie will be the one that does the new trilogy... the only hope that remains is that the guy is fired before starting to film it.","true":true}
