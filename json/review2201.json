Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrific addition to the lore of Star Wars. Not a perfect movie\\,  but some of the greatest scenes in Star Wars history. You have to see this movie a few times to really understand the scope of it all \\n and truly appreciate what Ryan Johnson has accomplished.","true":true}
