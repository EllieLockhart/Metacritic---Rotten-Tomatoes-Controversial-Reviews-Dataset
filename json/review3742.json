Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than The Force Awakens. Apart from a few issues it's a really good film\\, The worst problems are Daisy Ridley's awful acting and that Kylo Ren is a terrible character\\, he's just a boring whiney spoilt brat. Apart from these two\\, the other actors are good and the film holds uo pretty well\\, if you can forgive some large plot holes.","true":true}
