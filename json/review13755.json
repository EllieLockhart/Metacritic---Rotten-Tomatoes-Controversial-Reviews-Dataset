Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If lack of character development isn't enough\\, how about no clear narrative and a complete undoing of story from the preceding film?  With so much wrong with this movie I'll let the 1.5 stars I gave it speak for itself (giving it 1.5 stars since I disliked \u2018The Phantom Menace' even more).  How do the critics justify a 91% Fresh rating while the audience is hovering at 44% Rotten?!","true":true}
