Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. Luke Skywalker's character ark is B.S. Luke overcame his Darth Vader\\, and indirectly\\, the Emperor ; he should have remained optimistic and confident even as an older Jedi; obewan was more optometistic after seeing all he held dear fall apart. Luke has no excuse. Also\\, Kylo Ren should have turned when he was away from Luke and involved with Snoke; as is\\, those plot lines just don't work.\\n2. The general of the revil fleet doesn't act like a general. She's way to soft and completely unbelievable as a character. She comes off as a sympathetic mother to a hot headed teenager instead of the general of a rebel army.","true":true}
