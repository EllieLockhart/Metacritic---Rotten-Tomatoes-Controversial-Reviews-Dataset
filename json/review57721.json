Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter Epic Disaster! Why did Rian\\, Kennedy\\, and Disney screw up so bad. Critics are losing all credibility here and are being exposed. The mirror scene is so bad no body even remembers to try to interpret it. Countless flaws and plot holes leaves us no reason to ever watch it again let alone episode 9. The so called humor was epically bad and awkward.  All previous characters from Luke to Chewbacca were wasted and given nothing of substance. Sadly the same can be said for the new characters as well. So upset with this movie that I signed up for rotten tomatoes just so that I can add a comment to how bad thus movie is. SJW and politically agenda was beyond anything imaginable.  The only silver lining is something which even Mark Hamill admitted to is that its just a movie.   So we fans don't have to waste the next 2 or more years of our lives speculating and waiting for the next film.
