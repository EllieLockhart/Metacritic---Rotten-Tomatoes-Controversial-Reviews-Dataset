Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Doing my best to keep nostalgia away and provide unbiased feedback. I did not enjoy this movie one bit. Too many plot holes and terrible acting performances. It did not do the franchise justice. Very disappointed.","true":true}
