Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know if I can put the blame solely on Rian Johnson\\, as ultimately Disney is the primary owner of the property. But where I really still enjoy TFA\\, this movie just baffles me. I know I'm retreading what so many others are saying\\, but it really is true. The plot holes are massive\\, it's unnecessarily long for the amount of material the script has and it sends so many mixed messages. My biggest issue is just how we wouldn't have a movie if one character in the beginning explains what their plan. This to me is the true problem that if it weren't for this\\, we would have no movie. It feels as if they wrote a first draft\\, never read it and then filmed it. While I'm not a fan of the prequels and make no mistake they have bad writing\\, I don't feel like the movies wouldn't exist had someone simply talked to another person about what their intentions were. As much as it hurts me to say this\\, but this one doesn't just fail as a Star Wars movie\\, it fails as a movie.","true":true}
