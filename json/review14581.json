Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a lon time star wars fan and i have to say that this movie is worst than the emoji movie. Its plot trys to push political agendas instead of delivering somthing that people want. Also there where one to many jokes that made me cringe more than watching jar jar binks or anakin talking about how much he hates sand. The only good thing about this film is the speciale efects.","true":true}
