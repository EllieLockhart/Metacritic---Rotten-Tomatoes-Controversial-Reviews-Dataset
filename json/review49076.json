Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. Disney just shot in their own  foot. The way they handled iconic characters like Luke and Leia is awful! Sure\\, they built up for this one and are selling tickets but I can bet ep. IX will be a massive failure after seen this one...","true":true}
