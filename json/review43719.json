Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the first Star Wars movie I didn't like.  It felt way too depressing to me\\, from start to finish it just felt depressing.  It didn't help that none of my questions were answered in this movie.  After watching this movie I feel as if I've learned nothing.","true":true}
