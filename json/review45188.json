Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike other \\\"fans\\\" I realize the new trilogy of the Star Wars movies are not for the old generation\\, but the new generation and I'm able to watch these with an open mind. I greatly enjoyed watching the new heroes find their place in the new rebellion. It was bitter sweet seeing Princess Leia. I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone. It's got the feels of Empire Strikes back with a twist. I completely recommend watching.","true":true}
