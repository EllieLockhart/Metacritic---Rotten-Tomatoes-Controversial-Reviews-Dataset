Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to review The Last Jedi. It was THAT BAD. There is zero plot\\, and it feels like a huge money grab. All of the great characters and possible storylines that The Force Awakens set up were junked and all mostly for some cheap cringe-worthy laughs. Kylo Ren shirtless...really? Luke throwing the light saber. Snoke is killed and we don't learn anything about his backstory. (Albeit the best scene of the movie with Rey and Kylo saber battle) Luke is whiney and Rey came from nowhere. The \\\"codebreaker\\\"...I mean seriously? The only hint of a plot is a ship that is running out of gas and cant shake the first order destroyers\\, wooo. The whole casino scene? Worthless. I can't even say my hopes were too high because The Force Awakens left a canvas for so many great stories for the characters. Dissapointing.","true":true}
