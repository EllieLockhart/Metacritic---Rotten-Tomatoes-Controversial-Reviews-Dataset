Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most disappointing experiences I have had in a long time\\, and by far the worst one in the Star Wars universe. Visually\\, it was pretty\\, and well designed\\, except for the moronic bombers and \\\"speeders\\\" They simply make zero sense in a sci fi context. \\nThe tempo was completely off\\, right from the very beginning when the first order is portrayed as buffons rather than establishing credibility as the \\\"big bad\\\"  This destroyed immersion for me right from the getgo\\, and the incoherent scripting was never able to regain suspension of disbelief.   Jokes are fine and great\\, but should be used to break continued\\, high levels of tension\\, here\\, they opened with jokes that failed to land\\, and never managed to establish tension. \\nThe story \\\"progressed\\\" with leaders scapegoating in order to emasculate Poe\\, and show \\\"powerful\\\" characters by tearing other characters down to show their superior value. \\nAll this comes free\\, with a plot so disturbingly full of holes it appears to be a paper researched and written the night before it was due.  This plot disrespects physics\\, and especially logical thought and intelligent tactics so much that it was not possible for me to get into the film.\\nSuspension of disbelief is critical for getting moviegoers to overlook or forgive technical oversights.. but this film never came close to establishing enough credibility\\, and has a HUGE number of logic failures that require forgiving. \\nOverall.. it was pretty.. but the writing was horrific\\, and kept delivering one insult after another. The story was never gripping\\, tense\\, nor entertaining\\, leaving my most frequent thought during the film as \\\"are you f*$#@ng kidding me?\\\"","true":true}
