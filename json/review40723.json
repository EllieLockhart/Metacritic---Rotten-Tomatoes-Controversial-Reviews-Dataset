Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This makes the prequels (Episodes 1 - 3) look good. Rian Johnson destroyed the story line in favor of some social justice agenda. I also don't see why he made Hux out to be some idiot. The First Order is supposed to command fear and intimidation. Rian did the opposite. But worst of all is what they did with Luke's character. They made him out to be some crazy hermit rather than focusing on his legend of being a great Jedi.","true":true}
