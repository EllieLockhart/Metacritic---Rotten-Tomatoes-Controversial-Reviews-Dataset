Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an epic fail. Critics rating a movie this highly just proves their ignorance. How many more tired ass movies saying \\\"rebellions are built on hope\\\" garbage movies are they going to make. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ORIGINAL OR EXCITING IN THIS MOVIE. Half of the movie is the same old thing of a bunch of little ships shooting at a big one or vice versa. Then the Finn side story is so boring and useless filler is sadly devastating to ones brain. Then the Rey-Ren interactions are unemotionally gripping. And Leia floating in space--so trash","true":true}
