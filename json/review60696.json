We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"* The ending of the first game sets up the second game really well for a couple of possible things to happen.\r\r1. Humanity is condemned due to the actions of Joel\\, so it makes sense that he'll be killed or face some major consequences in the second game. However\\, I think they killed him too early\\, in a random encounter\\, which is bad imo.\r\r2. It doesn't make sense for the fireflies to disband after they lose Ellie\\, they could've gone after her in the second game\\, and Abby's story could've been embedded within that main story. (PS: Saying that Abby's father was the last person who could perform the surgery\\, is a **** reason for the fireflies to disband. It's a throw-in reason that they made up for the second game and wasn't even foreshadowed in the previous game. Moreover\\, Abby's father had Mel as his best student. They also had the whole continent filled with all sorts of people and factions to go through and look for a competent enough doctor\\, so it doesn't make sense that there won't be any other doctor out there that can preform the surgery.)\r\r3. The second game could've been a second journey where Joel and Ellie try to fix their broken relationship\\, or maybe Ellie tries to escape to the fireflies\\, to save humanity and Joel follows her on this journey\\, trying to stop her and maybe the player gets some sort of choice\\, either help her get to the finish line (for real this time)\\, or try to force her back and end up getting killed.\r\r* My thoughts on the story they chose to use:\r\r1. The story of the game is supposed to be a commentary on how revenge is bad and it'll only bring pain and hurt to you and the people around you. Ellie's action felt very unrealistic and stupid for her character to do\\, even if she was blinded by revenge. Abby spared Ellie twice\\, and in the second encounter\\, she spared her loved one\\, her kid and Tommy\\, she could've easily killed them on her way out after knocking Ellie out.\rIt felt very strange for Ellie to fully settle down then to choose to go after Abby\\, especially because that it could put Dina and JJ. in harms way. It felt like a contradiction to the type of person that she was set up to be in the previous game and in this one.\r\r2. The pacing of the story was really weird. It had a lot of unconnected plot points (Mostly the Abby section of the game)\\, it felt like it could be a part of a standalone game\\, rather than half of the main game.\r\rEven with everything that I discussed above\\, I still think that It's a very enjoyable game\\, that I loved and would recommend to people. However\\, It's not the type of game that I enjoyed enough\\, that I would replay it. I heard someone put it best\\, It would be good as a separate new IP\\, but sort of meh as the The Last of Us Part II\u2026 Expand","true":true}
