Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seemed as though they had two writers. One that wanted to try new stuff and the other who fell back on predictability and cheap audience gratification. There were a lot of interesting set ups but they pulled back from every single one. Cheap jokes were thrown into serious scenes that ruined the tone of said scenes. The tone of the entire movie in no way reflected the events of the movie.","true":true}
