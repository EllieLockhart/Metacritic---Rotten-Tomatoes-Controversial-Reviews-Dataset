Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"120 minutes of the movie was pure garbage. Characters\\, story\\, everything dumbed down and forced. whole parts of the movie are just filler with side stories that Jake no sense. Surprised Empire didn't do a pit manuver on rebel ship could have saved a hour right there.","true":true}
