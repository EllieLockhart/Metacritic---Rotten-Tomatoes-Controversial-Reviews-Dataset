Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was heavily flawed\\, and personally falls as the worst Star Wars film out of all 8. The thing that really made this bad was the persistent need to be funny\\, with quick witted lines that was unbecoming of a star wars film. I understand the direction that the firm wanted to take with the force\\, but it didn't take the time to build on the idea of the universe. There was very little conversation where we had any character development. Opposed to Poe\\, no one grow or change\\, or we knew anything more. It was one fight scene after another\\, no real story just a constant struggle. The film could not even exist and we probably would not even be confused going into Episode 9. A disappointed Star Wars Episode.","true":true}
