Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You really ruined Star Wars ... any movie of the precuel is a master piece next to this. I give 1\\,5 stars because people say rotten tomatoes doesn't count half star. If i could i'll give negative score to this ... thing\\, is not even a movie.","true":true}
