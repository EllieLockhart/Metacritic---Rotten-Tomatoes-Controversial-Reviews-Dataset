Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leaving where the Force Awakens left off\\, Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to be trained by Luke Skywalker\\, in the 'master refuses to train the pupil but eventually does' cliche. Meanwhile\\, the Resistance Fleet is naturally being chased by the First Order -- it isn't Star Wars if the rebels aren't being chased! The Resistance finds safe harbor on a salty planet\\, but their safety is short-lived as the First Order brings out the Walkers in scenes too reminiscent of the Empire Strikes Back. If you like odes to the original trilogy\\, then you may enjoy these scenes\\, I for one\\, thought the film  was too recycled and could have used some additional creativity. At least go to a non-white planet to make a last stand! Is that too much to ask?","true":true}
