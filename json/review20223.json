Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was one of the best movies of the year\\, of the decade and of the star wars franchise. It felt very mildly flawed\\, because these days you have to try to please everyone and that sometimes turns up taking away from the movie but overall\\, i feel it was exactly what star wars is supposed to be about.","true":true}
