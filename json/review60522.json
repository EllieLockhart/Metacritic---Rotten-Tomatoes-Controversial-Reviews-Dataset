Naughty Dog aren't in their own league\\, they're in their own universe.\r\rOn display is cinema-grade scripting and performance. The game delivers characters that are meaningful and resonate emotionally. The gameplay is slick and polished\\, while the combat feels heavy and consequential in a way few games come close to matching. Everything is wrapped-up in an industry-leading presentation\\, with graphics\\, visual design\\, and sound that will leave your jaw on the floor. The content provided is incredibly generous for a narrative experience\u2014with even a quick first play-through lasting around 25 hours (mine was over 32 hours).\r\rThe plot has come in for some particular\u2014and wholly unjustified\u2014criticism. At this level of storytelling characters are conflicted and not all plot threads lead to a happy end. The very plot devices that have been criticised by others can be found in some of the greatest works of literature ever produced.\r\rIn the end\\, I think people will eventually come to view TLoU2 in a similar light to Empire Strikes Back. Yes\\, it's the \\\"slower\\, more philosophical one with an open ending\\\"\\, but once the trilogy is complete everyone will understand that this is where the real meat of narrative arc lies.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
