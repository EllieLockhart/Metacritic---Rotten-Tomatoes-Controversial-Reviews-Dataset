Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not your normal Star Wars movie. You might not see any of it coming. But that\u2019s what makes this such a fun movie! Go watch it and see for yourself.","true":true}
