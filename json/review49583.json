{"101487":199266,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, my review has just been cut?! I don\u00b4t know what happened and why but the fact is at least 80 percent of ALL Star Wars fan dislike or hate the LAST JEDI... simply and alone by weaponizing hyperspace\\, it ruined the original Saga?!?! in fact every Star Wars movie WTF?!
