Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Edited review.  Sorry\\, for some reason everything is coming in caps???  sorry!!\\n\\nFirstly\\, to the guy who keeps saying make it one star or more...  If it was going to make a difference that 48% would have moved by now.  Frankly\\, the RT % is falsified\\, it is not a real number.  Which says all sorts of things about the authenticity of this site.  Simply put: Shame on you RT.\\n\\nThis foolishly made film was more a transparent join the dots political manifesto than a coherent story.  \\n\\nwhile one can understand someone with a political agenda making a pitch to 'sell'  the feminist \/ anti capitalist concept\\, the fact that it was green lighted\\, and then the fact that it was accomplished so ham-fistedly really makes you wonder about those with decision-making responsibility at disney.\\n\\nI am one that thinks TFA set up the rest of a trilogy on a shaky footing (why make han and leia estranged\\, for example \/ why kill han \/ why make another giant space gun \/ why cast an emo as a villain).  Be that as it may\\, rian johnson ruined any chance f this trilogy having any kind of satisfactory pay off.  iconic characters were disposed of at a whim\\, new and stupid laws of the force were introduced\\, and what could have been a subtle addressing of diversity and gender equality in the SW universe were handled in a laughably embarrassing manner.  it fells like it was written by an angst-ridden 18 year old gender-studies student with a chip on their shoulder.\\n\\nOh\\, and when circumstances dictated that we had the perfect way to farewell poor carrie\\, that can was just kicked down the road.\\n\\nRian Johnson should be ashamed of himself and if he was railroaded into making a political statement by kennedy\\, then he needs to grow a paid and defend himself.\\n\\nI am ashamed of everyone involved in this movie with the exception of mark hamill.  Good on him for calling out the absurd story and then being a pro and going through with it.","true":true}
