Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has does definitely changed the atmosphere and the climate in the Star Wars universe. Some of the action sequences were performed fantastically while some of the performance make me cringe like they shouldn't have considered even putting that thought into production. \\nThe action scene in which Kylo Ren confronted General Organa's Capital Ship really got us the audience involved in what was to come in the next scene. This scene really gave us the audience a reason why Kylo may turn back to the good side. Rian Johnson really does a fantastic job on showing the inner conflict and the raw emotions that was inflicted the main antagonist (Kylo). Throughout the entire movie we are constantly reminded about his inner struggles on deciding who he should be. Kylo is often deciding should he be a villain or the hero in all of this. By the end of this movie Kylo decides to need a new direction of an evil villain that will definitely make Star Wars fans interested for the next Star Wars Blockbuster.","true":true}
