Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For those who didn't like The Force Awakens\\, you'll wish JJ Abrams had returned to helm this film. As a Star Wars super fan who is probably a little too obsessed\\, I have never left the theater feeling disappointed by a Star Wars film\\, and that includes The Phantom Menace when I watched it on opening night as a 19 year old college student. I'm not going to post spoilers\\, so I'll say there are a few good moments in the film\\, but overall it's a mess. Humor in a SW film is a key component\\, yet this had too much out of place humor. There is an entire side plot that amounts to nothing\\, but does provide time for bathroom breaks. Major characters on both sides are grossly misused\\, and will leave you asking why? The fact Disney is giving Rhian Johnson his own trilogy excited me when they announced it\\, but now\\, and to a lot of diehard fans like myself I would bet\\, are hoping they change their mind. It saddens me to say that I did not like this film\\, and probably won't continue my normal multiple viewings like I've done with all the other films.\\n\\nEDITED - After multiple viewings of this film\\, I came to realize that my initial reaction was due to my expectations of what questions would be answered\\, and my disappointment with the direction certain things went such as Luke's portrayal. Brushing those aside\\, and watching the film without waiting for certain answers allowed me to not be biased and I enjoyed the movie a lot more. I still don't like certain things\\, such as Luke's attitude and his being killed off so to speak\\, there are a lot of things I really liked. So my score is now 4 stars. A solid entry into the Star Wars saga with many twists and beautiful cinematography along with a breathtaking soundtrack.","true":true}
