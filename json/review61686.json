The last of us touched my heart\\, and it will take me a long time to find something more shocking and emotional. This game is an experience\\, not a fanservice for fanboys of characters from the first game. It's about a post-apocalyptic world\\, about consequences\\, about choices and especially about showing the principles of each of the people who played. Like or dislike says a lot about who you are. I feel sorry for those who failed to appreciate TLOU Part II and especially for those who make themselves so unhappy seeing the reactions of the people they liked.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
