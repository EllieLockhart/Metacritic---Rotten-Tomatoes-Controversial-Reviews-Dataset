Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie..I wanted to love this movie\\, however I found myself simply asking myself what was the point of it all\\, why try to get me to care about characters \\,build them up to crescendo\\, only to smash them like the neighborhood bully breaking toys. Change simply for the sake of itself is not good. Change driven by narrative is. No amount of critical acclaim\\, or critical starsplaining is going to get me to change my mind. Had the story been driven properly I could have been on board\\, I liked the new characters I had resolved to give them a fair shake. I'm tired of hearing how different it was as if most of us were incapable of going forward with the story. You have at the end a villain with no presence a hero with no guidance \\, and sadly a corner that you have painted yourself into with the tragic passing of our Princess. Oh and insulting my intelligence by suggesting some political motive for my dislike is disingenuous\\, and beneath any more acknowledgement than this. I love this franchise. Bring it back to all of us.","true":true}
