Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE LAST JEDI is exactly what it should have been. An emotionally jawing second chapter to an undeniably awe-inspiring trilogy. This only adds to the Star Wars canon and creates new rules for where the franchise can go. It stands out among the best of this series' films and among the best films of this year. Definitely worth the trip to see Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley in their growing relationship\\, but especially the tense connections seen between Ridley and Adam Driver. Many cameos and appearances of beloved characters. The Last Jedi is a fun-filled adventure that leaves you hanging onto every word. Rating: 9\/10","true":true}
