Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just meh. What a huge letdown from Johnson. Hoping this one would make me a Star Wars fun but didn\u2019t happen. Not even mad about Luke\\, the main sin of this movie is just being so boring. Jokes didn\u2019t hit and didn\u2019t have enough action to draw me in. ","true":true}
