Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My spoiler free review of \\\"StarWars: The Last Jedi\\\":-\\n\\n\\\"I have a bad feeling about this!\\\"\\n\\nIt's an enjoyable movie in itself\\, looks amazing and has some good moments but as a StarWars chapter \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a travesty! \\n\\nIt basically tears up all running plot lines and long loved characters in the most disappointing way and throws them in the trash compactor.\\n\\nTotal disrespect for established characters and mythology\\, poor story telling\\, bad humour\\, gaping plot holes and.....well I could go on but as a life long StarWars fan\\, I just feel betrayed.\\n\\nThe sequel trilogy is now pretty much dead! There's nothing interesting to continue into ep9 and little for JJ Abrams to work with after Rian Johnson basically tore up what he started. So unfortunately the disasterous ep8 takes the fairly good ep7 down with it. With all ep7's interesting threads thrown away with total anti climax\\, ep7 is now pointless.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi (and probably the whole sequel trilogy with it) is worse than the prequel trilogy. Sure there's huge criticism for the prequels but at least they were a good story.\\n\\nScrew you Disney!","true":true}
