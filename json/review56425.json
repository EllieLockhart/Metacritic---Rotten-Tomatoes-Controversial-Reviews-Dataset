Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best surprise for me was not how solid and deserving a Stars Wars adventure this was...but the curious and inexplicable negativity shown to it by so many public reviewers.\\nI'm tempted to say a social media experiment is underway when I see 0\u00e2?? and 1\/2\u00e2?? flier ratings by the dozen\\, sprinkled in with the 4 & 5\u00e2?? reviews.\\nThe movie did run slightly long and did indeed have a couple of slow spots....but the over-riding sense I received was that this episode along with Rogue One and Episode 7\\, mark a steering of the franchise towards an intelligent world view of life\\, right and wrong\\, consequence and choice - while still giving the viewer enough fun\\, childlike spirit and swashbuckling moments to stay exciting and true to the heart of the Star Wars series that I've grown up loving\\, hating\\, and then loving again.\\nCertainly worthwhile entertainment that also just might be trying to teach us all about true life lessons.","true":true}
