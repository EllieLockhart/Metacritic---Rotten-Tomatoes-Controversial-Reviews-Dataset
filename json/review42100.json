Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie reached too far back and was a real disappoint for me.  Most of the new characters annoyed me and the movie felt a little too Disney like for me to appreciate.  The action and fighting scenes were plentiful but was very predictable and not exciting.","true":true}
