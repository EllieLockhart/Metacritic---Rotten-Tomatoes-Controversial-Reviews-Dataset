Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is an interesting film. Being that it's the middle child of a sequel trilogy it was important to have developments in the plot and characters that push the series towards the next film. I think it does that. There are certainly plot twists and turns that leave you wondering what will episode 9 bring? But there is so much information to digest in this film that I think it's important to take time to analyze everything and maybe even see the movie again before calling it a bad movie. It's loaded with hints in ideas for episode 9. I disagree with much of the critique for it; I think it is indeed one of the best Star Wars movies made.","true":true}
