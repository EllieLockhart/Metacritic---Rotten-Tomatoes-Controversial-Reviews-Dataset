Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't care about these characters.  And the ones I do like (Han Solo\\, Luke Skywalker\\, Leah\\, Chubacca\\, R2D2 and C3PO) were never reunited all together.  The most Epic waste of potential awesomeness of all time.  It's almost as if the writer\/director didn't like Star Wars.   The remaining characters\\, who do we care about?  Rey? Poe? Fin? They're as fun as dentist's waiting room.","true":true}
