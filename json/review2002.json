Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A spit on the existing lore. The plot is too thin\\, too fiddling around. Basically\\, the whole plot is that resistance is trying to run away from First Order pursuit. For 2.5 hrs! Phasma is always mending to be underwhelming\\, but Snoke! Seriously! Rather than fleshing out Rose arc\\, I prefer we find out Snoke's\\, Rey's backstory\\, or even Luke's clear motives before his exile. Rotten to the core.","true":true}
