Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too long with not enough interesting characters (with poe being the only interesting one)\\, was hoping snoke would be the stand out bad guy but killed off too quickly. Captain plasma was a pointless character\\, found the film disjointed and a overall slog to watch. Nothing really memorable probably the worst one out of the lot for me\\, it's the hope that kills you.","true":true}
