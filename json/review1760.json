Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I really wish I could give a good review but from the beginning of the movie to the end it was chocked full of horrible decisions that made me angry and  Kept me angry as there was no chance to recover. It's a bad parody of a Star Wars movie made by people who have no idea what fans would like to see. I hate to say it but one of the worst movies I have ever seen.","true":true}
