Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***This review is heavily laden with spoilers\\, so if you haven't seen the movie\\, please note: You've been warned***\\n\\nIt's a very long review\\, but a fair review\\, so buckle up\\n\\nSeeing the reaction to this website has inspired me to create an account and give what I believe is an honest review.\\n\\nIs the Last Jedi the worst in the franchise. No.\\n\\nIs it the best in the franchise? No.\\n\\nSo there\\, I've already debunked the two extremes out there - I'm giving it a modest 3 out of 5 stars because I believe the problems it faced was a switch in directors.\\n\\nHere is where we get to the spoilers;\\n\\nFirst\\, people need to stop calling the \\\"Fanboys\\\" \\\"haters\\\" because they \\\"didn't get what they wanted\\\"\\,  it's a lot deeper than that. Star Wars has a very strong lineage in cinema\\, and most of us grew up with the original trilogy \\, and most of us can acknowledge no movies will live up to the hype\\, or excitement of the original trilogy because it was inspired on something new. Anything building off of that foundation will be weighed against the original content\\, and it's nearly impossible to beat that (such as most sequels aren't as good as the first movie with the odd exceptions like Terminator 2 Judgement Day\\, Aliens\\, Godfather part 2\\, etc)\\n\\nSo what did the fans want? They wanted answers. They wanted more pieces to the trilogy puzzle.  What made the original trilogy special is the three movies complemented each other so well\\, that by the time Empire Strikes Back ended you were in love with these characters and you felt their burden - Han was frozen in carbonite\\, Luke lost his hand\\, found out Vader is his father\\, the rebel alliance fractured - it made your heart sink. The bad guys won that movie - and that was a risk in the 1980's. We're so used to the good ol \\\"Good vs Evil\\, Good triumphs always.\\\" So when Return of the Jedi rolled around\\, even against all odds \\, it made the success of our protagonists feel so much more worth it. They started the movie at an all time low - and there was no way they could have achieved their feats - Luke shouldn't have beat Vader\\, Vader shouldn't have turned on Palpatine\\, Han & Leia shouldn't have been able to drop the Death Stars shields\\, Lando shouldn't have been able to blow up the Death Star - but they did it\\, and they did it because they had \\\"Hope\\\" - which is why the title for Episode 4 \\, \\\"A New Hope\\\" was so fitting.\\n\\nNow fast forward to this new trilogy \\, it was forgivable for Force Awakens a pass and chalk it up to an average movie - even if it lended itself to the tropes we already saw in Episode 4\\, but that's because  it was meant for a new generation of Audience today. It still gave enough fan service to \\\"my generation\\\" (original trilogy ) that it felt welcoming to both new comers and veterans of the series.\\n\\nWhere the Last Jedi fumbled is the questions and mystery asked by Force Awakens was not answered ... and frankly doesn't feel like it will be.\\n\\nSnoke is presumed to be an all time powerful Sith Juggernaut - the mystery surrounding him was incredible in Force Awakens. To see him clumsily treated as a throw away character was insulting. Fans aren't looking for validation of their fan fiction\/theories - they just wanted to know *more*\\, period. Where did Snoke come from? How did he raise the First Order after the Imperial Army fell? A person with as much presence and power as the Emperor doesn't just *exist*\\n\\nThe counter argument people say to that is \\\"Well in Episode 4-6 there was no build up to the Emperor\\, he just existed\\\" ... and while that is true\\, when you jump into Episode 4 as a new comer-  you can tell this is a living\\, breathing universe where these people have existed before this movie even started. With this new trilogy\\, it doesn't have that luxury to take for granted. Yes the universe existed before hand - but the problem is\\, we were there to witness it\\, so with that we expect answers.\\n\\nWith Rey and the mystery of her parents - I feel like it's either a red herring that Kylo said they were just junk traders who sold her - I personally feel like there is more to this since if you watch Force Awakens and when Rey touches the lightsaber and you get her flashback scene\\, there's the part where her parents ship flies away - and Unkar Plutt (that sick dude Rey was selling ship parts to) grabs her by the arm and says \\\"Quiet Girl\\\") - makes it seem like her parents are more than simple Junkers if they have a ship like that .  Also the scene shows Kylo and the Knights of Ren - but hey Rian Johnson\\, let's completely abandon the Knights of Ren.... \\n\\nNext\\, the treatment of Luke Skywalker was haphazard at best. Tossing his original lightsaber over his shoulder\\, discarding it carelessly\\, was basically a giant slap in the face and middle finger to the fans. Let's look at this lightsaber - it belonged to his father\\, Anakin before he turned to the dark side. This is an heirloom weapon that was kept safe with Obiwan \\, and given to Luke. When he had his hand cut off and lost it\\, the chance to ever see this lightsaber again is nearly non-existent\\, so it seems very uncharacteristic for Luke to toss it aside without a care or even a second thought.\\n\\nSo what are we then left with in this movie aside from deviations\/plot points that the Force Awakens left for us? We're left with cinemas slowest space chase in history (rivals the spaceship landing on the moon in Space Odessy 2001)\\n\\nWe're left with awkward shoe horned \\\"sub plots\\\" that revolve around this space ship chase (Finn and Rose going to a Casino planet to get a hacker\/slicer - and they bring back a hacker\/slicer \\, but not even the one they were looking for ... ) . \\n\\nWe're left Poe having an ego stand off with Holdo - because Holdo for some reason or another wants to play the cards close to her chest and not answer the guys question of \\\"We're all going to die\\, what is the plan\\\" - this is stupid. He's your best pilot\\, and after Leia explains the plan to him\\, he was very much on board with the plan.\\n\\nAlso tossing aside staples to the franchise like Admiral Ackbar with an offscreen death leaves a sour taste in the long time fan's mouths. Maybe Holdo shouldn't have even been a character\\, maybe it should have been Ackbar who took command of the ship - that way the sacrifice at the end of the movie of the cruiser jumping to light speed into Snokes ship would have felt like a terrific send off for Ackbar. Holdo just feels like an empty character we were introduced to\\, only to throw away - just as Snoke was. \\n\\nI can't give the movie a one star because it wasn't *bad* \\, but it certainly wasn't *good* \\n\\nIf you made it this far\\, I applaud you and hope you can understand the rational as to why fans were upset. If this was a standalone movie\\, it would have been alright - but it wasn't it's the second step in a trilogy but felt like a huge deviation.","true":true}
