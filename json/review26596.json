Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, are there issues with the film? Yes. I would love for you to find me a film that doesn't have them. I've spent the last hour reading reviews\\, both good and bad\\, and I can say\\, in my own opinion\\, those who say it's ruined their childhood or ruined the characters never understand them to begin with. This film showcases how Luke Skywalker was not the legend he was portrayed as. He was a man\\, plan and simple. We are all light and dark at times. Those who choose not to see that did not listen to the script and ignore the mythos. Are there moments of weird humor? Yes. Is Finn's storyline semi unnecessary? Sure. But I think this is much more of a thinking person's movie. It requires you to relenquish all of your pre conceived ideas of what Star Wars is and can be. I highly suggest you go into this movie knowing you are getting something completely different\\, and steeped in character development over action set pieces.","true":true}
