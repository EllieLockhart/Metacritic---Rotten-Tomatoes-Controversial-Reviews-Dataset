Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best Star Wars movies made. I'm really confused as to why supposed fans are so upset by it.  \\n\\nI consider myself a pretty hardcore Star Wars fan (can recite the a new hope pretty much word for word) and I thought that the trailers and the films made the film interesting and different in a way that I couldn't have anticipated.\\n\\nReally pleased that it didn't go \\\"grey\\\" and thought the Leia bit in space was both odd and unnecessary but the lightsabre battle and the bit in the casino planet were both inspired.  Absolutely loved it - I think others were too ingrained in their own theories to really accept the truth of how magnificent this film is!","true":true}
