Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would have to say that was the worst Star Wars movie of all time. I would even prefer watching Jar Jar then watch that snore fest again. In my opinion their attempt at rehashing empire strikes back (The best episode in my opinion) was terrible. Don't waste your money or time. The Critics have it totally wrong here!!!!","true":true}
