Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian johnson not only shit on the legacy characters\\, he threw away anything abrams set up.   mostly he did give any characters to any of the characters that all could be great characters played by the same cast.   not even saying she should not have directed it\\, but he absolutely should not have wrote the movie.","true":true}
