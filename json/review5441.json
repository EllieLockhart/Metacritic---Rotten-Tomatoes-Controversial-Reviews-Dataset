Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some solid performances and rich visuals\\, TLJ is an unpleasant film that disrespects the legacy of Star Wars\\, and leaves the Sequel Trilogy in a sort of limbo where nothing interesting is happening.\\nOften playing like a parody made by someone who hated the other Star Wars films\\, The Last Jedi is one of the most disappointing blockbuster films in years","true":true}
