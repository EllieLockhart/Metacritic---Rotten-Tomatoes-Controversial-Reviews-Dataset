Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever made. Disregards established characterizations from Star Wars The Force Awakens and previous legacy films. Characters aside\\, this film delivers a heavy-handed commentary against the Star Wars status quo\\, attempting to veer from expected Star Wars tropes and canon while simultaneously emulating plot and design aesthetics from Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back. If you want to watch non-stop action and the thrill of an over-powered First Order chasing a bunch of resistance escape pods for over an hour while actors struggle with delivering performances that make no sense\\, The Last Jedi and Brian Johnson deliver in spades. Disclaimer: in order for this review to appear I have to give it half a star\\, when in reality this film deserves no stars. ","true":true}
