Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst piles of garbage I have ever seen in recent years.\\nAnd what were they thinking making Leia fly through the vacuum of space like that. Totally unrealistic and just stupid.\\nThe social justice politics also doesn't help.\\nI'd give this movie -5 stars if I could.","true":true}
