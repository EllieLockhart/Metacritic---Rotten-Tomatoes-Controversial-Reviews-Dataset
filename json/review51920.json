Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film with a lot of interesting moments but without any sort of cohesion and connection to each other\\, all put together for the sake of presenting itself as the 'subversive' and 'deconstructionalist' member of the franchise (which ultimately devalue these said moments; i.e. the lightsabre battles).","true":true}
