Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trop de trous dans le sc\u00e9nario\\, un sc\u00e9nario ennuyant\\, quelques images po\u00e9tiques\\, aucune attention \u00e0 l'univers Star Wars\\, trop de sous-intrigues et d'intrigues qui finissent en queue de poisson\\, de l'humour vulgaires pas du tout n\u00e9cessaires","true":false}
