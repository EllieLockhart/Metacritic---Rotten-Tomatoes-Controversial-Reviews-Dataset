Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was ponderous and a mid-point at best. It tried to cover too many story lines. The part with Leia somehow flying back to the ship after being sucked into outer space was a little too fantasic as well. Luke disappointed as well initially. It was hard to accept his legend had fizzled so. Finally\\, if the rebellion is so popular that every kid in the galaxy wants to join\\, then why is the First Order so flush with resources and the entire rebel force gathering on board the millenium falcon at the end?","true":true}
