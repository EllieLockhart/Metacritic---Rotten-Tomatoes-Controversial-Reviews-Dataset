Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even the strength of Luke couldn't turn this ship all the way around.  A pointless flail of expensive (yet\\, somehow\\, cheap-looking) CGI that no amount of tacked-on quips\\, or even Carrie Fisher's luminescent star power\\, can rescue.   It's just a repetitive\\, goofy smash-a-thon that lacks the character development that made EMPIRE STRIKES BACK so great (also a vastly better film). A hasty\\, disjointed assemblage of two conflicting visions; a bad movie fused to a different bad movie.  For all the fracas\\, this is a curiously inert piece of action filmmaking. The dialogue borders on the cheesy with intermittent leaps headlong into the cheddar.","true":true}
