Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an insult to the series worse than the prequel trilogy. Just like its predecessor\\, it focuses on \\\"reimagining\\\" the story of the original\\, but does so in a worst way possible. The Last Jedi contains some of the most moronic scenes in the filming industry I've ever experienced. The way this Star Wars installment treats some of its characters is absolutely incomprehensible to me. How can you take such an iconic\\, relatable and badass character of all times and turn him into what you see in this movie - a failure? Explain that to me\\, if you can. Other characters are complete blank now. They have no motivation\\, no interesting stories to tell\\, and the worst offender is that they have no purpose to exist in this universe other then to create our so beloved forced diversity. Replace everyone in this film with only white male cast of movie veterans and nothing would change. They'd still be boring\\, moronic and have nothing to give\\, but at least there'd be some good performance. Not to say that the cast doesn't know\\, what they are doing\\, but they have absolutely nothing to work with. I guess that the writers were given a task like:\\\"PC\\, feminist and SJW bs first; logic\\, sense and general storytelling are not important\\\". Why? Why would you do that? Star Wars was never about that\\, it was about adventure! And let me tell you\\, this smoking garbage hardly qualifies as one. It will take for a one hell of a ride. A ride\\, full of idiots\\, moronic situations and stupid ways of getting out of them\\, and most importantly... forced romance. Good god.","true":true}
