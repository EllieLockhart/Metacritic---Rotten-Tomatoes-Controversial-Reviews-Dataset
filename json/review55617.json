Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only\\, by far\\, the most terrible movie of the entire SW Saga until now\\, but also one of the worst scripted sci-fi movies I've seen in my whole life (and I'm an over 40 nurtured by sci-fi movies and books\\, since I was a toddler). There are so many things to point out as flaws in this movie\\, but the worst thing\\, that summarise it all\\, is that they have killed one by one\\, with not so memorable final scenes\\, the old\\, monumental\\, characters of the Saga\\, to replace them with a bunch of childish\\, unidimensional\\, uninspired new characters\\, that seem more fitted in a Disney show for a children audience than in the Star Wars Universe. \\nThe movie in itself is also plagued by several plot holes and canon contradictions. However\\, it would nonetheless be somewhat entertaining and spectacular (the special effects are really very good\\, but it's the least you would expect from a movie with this budget)\\, if they would have cut off all the unnecessary\\, finical and boring sidequest at the Casino planet. If you are an old time fan of the Saga\\, don't watch it\\, it would only bring pain. If you're a newcomer\\, especially a very young one\\, you could give it a shot\\, but don't expect more than a blast of special effects\\, with few originality or deepness.","true":true}
