Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this more than \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d. Much more emotionally complex and thoughtful in my opinion...which it needed to be because the \u201cthey\u2019re making another Star Wars\u201d novelty has worn off. Can\u2019t wait to see how this all ends. ","true":true}
