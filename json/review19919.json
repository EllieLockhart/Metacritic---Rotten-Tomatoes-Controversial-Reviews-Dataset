Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was entertaining\\, but the moment you sit back and think\\, you realize\\, the majority of the story takes place over s very short period of time. in fact many crucial plots take place as the rebels are \\\"cruising away ever so slightly faster than their pursuers\\\". That fact in itself\\, the main plot and chase were so foolish. I mean it is like they wrote themselves into a corner. It was literally the dumbest plot point ever.","true":true}
