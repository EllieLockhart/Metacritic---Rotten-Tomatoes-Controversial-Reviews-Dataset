{"101487":163872,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RATE ONE STAR\\, NOT A HALF STAR! OTHERWISE IT WON'T COUNT!!\\nThis movie was so phenomenally terrible\\, both on its own and as a Star Wars movie. It pushes old and beloved characters aside in favor of pushing left wing agendas in an attempt to be unique and subversive.\\n\\nRian Johnson has shown that he has no understanding of the Star Wars franchise outside  of a partial understanding of the original trilogy. He makes multiple \\\"innovations\\\" with little regard to congruencey within the universe.\\n\\nThe first\\, and most egregious change\\,  is Luke Skywalker. Gone is the optimistic\\, young hero\\, who never gave up on the man who killed his master\\, amputated his hand\\, and killed many people\\, that we saw in Return of the Jedi. In his place is a cowardly\\, mean-spirited man who actually considered murdering the son of his sister and his best friend because he \\\"saw darkness\\\" in him. Although Mark Hamill delivers an admittedly great performance\\, the character as a whole has been tarnished and slandered. It doesn't help that he participated in easily the most disturbing and disgusting scenes in Star Wars history: milking a suspiciously human-looking animal teat and then drinking the milk.\\n\\nThen there's Rey\\, a character that could have been so interesting\\, but was ruined by a 3rd wave feminist agenda. Instead of having flaws such as a lack of restraint\\, control\\, or a susceptibility to the Dark Side's influence\\, she displays a mastery o all 3\\, despite only having learned of the Force's existence mere days prior. She also manages to defeat multiple Elite Guards wielding lightsaber-blocking weapons\\, without using supernatural abilities\\, and only suffer a cut on her shoulder. She is way too powerful and this took away any tension that fight scene could have had. She's also not very likable or relatable to the audience. If they were going for a feminist message\\, then it has fallen flat on its face in this movie\\, because Rey doesn't fail and then get up. She just wins\\, and that's bad writing.\\n\\nNext\\, Rose and Holdo\\, two of the most redundant characters in the movie. For the first major Asian female in Star Wars\\, I'm disappointed. She's completely redundant due to Finn\\, and the sudden romantic interaction makes Anakin and Padme's relationshhip feel real in comparison. She's only here so Rian can call his movie \\\"diverse\\\". Next is Holdo. Considering she's played by Laura Dern of Jurassic Park fame\\, I was excited to see what she would bring to Star Wars. But what we got was a personification of the problems with 3rd wave feminism\\, except it was unintentional. Her plan made no sense\\, and her clothing and hair just screamed \\\"We are feminist\\\".\\n\\nAlso\\, many characters hyped up with merchandising and trailers were reduced to one or two scenes or had little relevance to the story. R2D2\\, Chewie \\, Leia\\, Benicio Del Toro's character\\, and\\, most egregiously\\, Captain Phasma\\, the first female Star Wars movie villain. Even the Porgs\\, one the dumbest additions since Jar Jar\\, play no part in the story. They are only there to sell mugs\\, toys\\, and slippers\\, which is disappointing for such a legendary franchise.\\n\\nAlso\\, Snoke and Rey's backstories are never elaborated on. Snoke is killed in the most cartoonish way imaginable\\, making his story irrelevant\\, and Rey's parents are described as \\\"nobodies\\\"\\,giving absolutely no reason for her to have such incredible abilities in the first place.\\n\\nThere is also way too many stupid jokes. Constantly subverting expectations does not make a movie funny. The plot is also idiotic\\, and what's not being ripped from Empire or Jedi word for word\\, is turned into the slowest chase scene in cinema. The plot holes are also very noticeable\\, with the Canto Bight subplot being rendered useless\\, maning any time we could have spent with the Raddus or Luke was wasted with capitalism-bashing\\, space horse-racing antics.\\n\\nAccording to Rian Johnson\\, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away should be exactly like the present on Earth\\, with political opinions thrown about from scene to scene. If this movie is meant to be escapist\\, I couldn't find the \\\"escape\\\".\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie is lore-breaking\\, clickbaiting\\, political-messaging\\, childhood-ruining garbage. This movie has killed any chance of me and thousands of other devoted fans going to see any more of these new movies\\, until something changes over at LucasFilm. This movie may very well have killed the Star Was franchise forever. Rian Johnson and the people involved with the development of this film should be treated like murderers\\, because that's exactly what they did. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN!! RATE ONE STAR\\, NOT A HALF STAR! OTHERWISE IT WON'T COUNT!!","true":true}
