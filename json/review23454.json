Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the graphics loved the actors! But the story line to many reused sences from the original trilogy with all r\\nThe possibility with star wars you go with a remix of empire strikes back and return of the jedi the only thing i found suprising was there was no death star. Oh wait a death star sige cannon??????????","true":true}
