Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this movie was called Disney Space Adevtures it would easily be 4 out of 5. the effects are great\\, sets and costumes look amazing as well and if it was a generic space movie the plot holes wouldn't be a big deal\\, but this is Star Wars. Without giving away spoilers major plot threads are just dropped and left unexplained from the previous\\, the reunion of classic characters is underwhelming at best.
