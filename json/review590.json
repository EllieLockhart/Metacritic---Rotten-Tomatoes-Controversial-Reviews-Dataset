The game is pretty much all about the story and that's why you'll play it. It has a heavy reliance on jump scares at the beginning of the game but that's by design to throw you off towards the end. The game tries to get you thinking along the lines of a Michael Myers movie then hits you with something different around 1\/3 of the way through. The story may be fairly unoriginal but it's well done and you can tell the actors had a good time with it\\, even if Hayden Panettiere's character kinda doesn't fit in with the rest of the group dynamic very well. She feels like she was shoe horned in to give the game a little star power but it's not too much of a big deal in the long run. The main problem I have with the game is the gameplay portions. While the QTE stuff is over done at this point\\, it's not the problem that the Resident Evil-esque camera and movement functions are. Sudden camera changes and just bad controls make things fairly difficult just to move around regularly. Fortunately that doesn't translate to the shooting portions and the QTE portions of the game.\rThe game is good for what it is but it ended up becoming the PS4 exclusive for the holiday season and it was definitely not made to sell systems. It's a good time killer and horror fans will enjoy the experience. But the staying power really isn't there for me. Completing the story once gets you all you can get out of the experience and\\, unless you miss some collectibles\\, there's no reason to play it again. It's worth a rental for sure but I don't think I would recommend buying this for more than 20 bucks\\, even with the score I've given it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
