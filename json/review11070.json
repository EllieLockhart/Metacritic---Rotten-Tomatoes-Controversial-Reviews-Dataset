Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's what I liked most about this movie: originality.  The unexpected.  The fake outs.  The misdirection.  The director did it in Looper and carried that through to this movie.  There was no death star to destroy.  It managed to be both respectful and irreverent of the original characters\\, and the new.  Adam Driver gave an intense performance\\, likely best of the cast.  Here's what I didn't like: Kylo's foil (General Hux) is just a punching bag.  Hard to take evil seriously when it's that incompetent.","true":true}
