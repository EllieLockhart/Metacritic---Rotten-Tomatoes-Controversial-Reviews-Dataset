Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson; you had the most iconic face in cinematic history come back\\, and you blew it. You killed the mystic of Star Wars in the worst way possible\\, destroyed the true meaning behind the movies and left me more disappointed than the world could ever know. The Last Jedi was an abomination on so many levels.","true":true}
