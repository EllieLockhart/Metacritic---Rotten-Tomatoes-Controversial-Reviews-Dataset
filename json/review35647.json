Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an awesome movie. It is the most visually striking movie I've ever seen\\, and the character dynamics between Rey\\, Kylo and Luke are perfect. Rose and Fin have some great interactions too\\, although it's on top of a terrible filler story. Rey's emotional journey gives us someone who has a lot of challenges but also has the balls to face them\\, and Luke's conclusion makes us challenge whether we are even meant to understand how movie rules work. Plus\\, there's two scenes where the movie literally drops the mic\\, and it deserved it.","true":true}
