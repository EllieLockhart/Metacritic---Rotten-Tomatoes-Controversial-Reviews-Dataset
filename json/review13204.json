Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think this movie deserves a 53% audience rating\\, and does it deserve a 93% critic rating. This movie deserves a 81% critic rating and a 75% audience rating I believe. Why? Because that's what this movie achieves\\, an above average cinema experience. (ps i'm rating this movie 5 stars to offset the 53%). How Justice League got a higher audience rating than this movie is beyond me.","true":true}
