Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is enjoyable? Yes. It's hella good? Absolutely not. The whole story is some lame ass pursuit which I thought it could be resumed in half an hour. Finn goes through hell to achieve absolutely nothing\\, his whole part could be just thrown in the thrash. But well\\, it has lightsabers... And I gotta say\\, Kylo Ren is not a good villain\\, he doesn't have Darth Vader appeal or Palpatine evilness\\, even Snoke is a better villain.","true":true}
