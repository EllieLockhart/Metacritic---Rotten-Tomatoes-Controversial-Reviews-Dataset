Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually\\, Star wars the last jedi is a very beautiful movie. Multiple scenes from the show are beautiful and I could easily frame it. For this reason\\, I give this movie 2 stars.\\n\\nAs far as story\\, watching this movie felt like watching game of thrones but instead of being directed by someone that wants to show the gruesomeness of war and treason\\, it's being directed by a sissy who doesn't want to kill their favorite character. Teases the audience with \\\"Oh look\\, character 1 is dead\\, HAH! JUST KIDDING!\\\"\\n\\nIn star wars 7\\, we had an important death that basically meant \\\"Look\\, anyone can die\\\".\\n\\nIn Star wars 8\\, we see multiple \\\"They're dead\\\" moments but nope! Still alive! This removes completely the threat of death.","true":true}
