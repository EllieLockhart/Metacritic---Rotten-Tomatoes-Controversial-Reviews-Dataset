We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So I had heard a few plot point leaks prior to the release\\, but that did not stop my enjoyment of the game.\rThe Story for me was 10\/10 and perhaps the most ambitious and heart-wrenching narrative in any video game that I have played. I understand that for some people some of the narrative choices made are irredeemable\\, but to get the most out of this game you have to be willing to empathise and forgive\\, just as readily as you hate the characters.\r\rIf you go into the game expecting a safe sequel for the first game this is not what you are going to get. The world naughty dog created is brutal and the story and gameplay reflect this. At the beginning of the game\\, the realistic violence can leave one with a sense of glee ( who doesn't find it funny blowing up a guy and watching him disappear in a cloud of mist)\\, but after a while\\, after killing dogs\\, listening as the friends of the enemies you kill scream out their fallen comrades names you start to feel disillusioned with the character's righteousness. By the end of the game I was begging Ellie to end this revenge; no game has ever made me feel like this\\, not since the first the last of us.\r\rAbby's section of the game is genuinely one of the best\\, once you start to accept her. There was an initial slog at the beginning of her first day\\, but once you get captured by the seraphites she really comes into her own\\, and has some of the best set pieces and gameplay moments in the whole game. The stalker fight in the forest\\, all of day 2 and the scouring of the seraph island were perfection.\r\rOverall a 10\/10 game\\, well worth the seven year wait.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
