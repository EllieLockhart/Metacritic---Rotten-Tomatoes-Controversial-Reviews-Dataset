Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars movie yet. So poorly written\\, you will wonder aloud if this was hammered together by two nine year olds hunkered over the sandbox. Living under the bridge Luke taking milk from the teat\\, we're outta gas non action being the bulk of the plot.. flying nun hilarity\\, muppets in space\\, Buff McSadFace straight out of the third mall from the sun crap.","true":true}
