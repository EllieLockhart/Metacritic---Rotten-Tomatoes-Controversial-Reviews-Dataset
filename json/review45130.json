Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately i have to agree with many of the fans. If this movie was a stand alone movie with no relation to the Star wars franchise it would have failed and Disney would have had to write it off. However they got a free pass because of its relationship with the Star Wars brand. I understand the reason to kill off older characters to drive future movies but absolutely no character development\\, jedis are automatically created with no training\\, and heck women fly through space too. Hopefully Disney relinquishes the rights to this franchise before causing severe and ever lasting damage. The goosebumps i had at the start of the movie was replaced with disdained feelings. Next movie i will likely wait for video as it no longer has the originality we all have come to expect and enjoy when we were on the playground arguing on who will play luke\\, han\\, and Leia.
