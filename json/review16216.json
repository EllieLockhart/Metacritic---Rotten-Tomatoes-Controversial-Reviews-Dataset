Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm just going to tell myself that this is some alternative reality Star Wars where Rei ate some magic beans that contained the reincarnated souls of all the former Jedi masters and that's why she is so good at everything without having any training and Luke picked up some horrible parasite on Dagobah and its been lying dormant for decades then suddenly hatched in his brain and caused a complete personality change. Also\\, the laws of physics don't apply in this alternate universe so people don't explode when you shove them out of an air lock or blow up their ship and...what am I missing. Oh ya\\, Snoke's really just a smoke screen. The Porgs are the evil geniuses that run the galaxy....good GOD wouldn't that have made for a better movie?","true":true}
