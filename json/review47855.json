Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start? There were amazing moments in this movie. However the editing was sloppy at best. The room that Snoke was in looked like a set from a high school play. Kylo Ren is easily the worst villain in star wars history. Luke and Chewie and Leia were there because I have no idea. The plotline of the first order chasing the rebel ship that was running out of gas was lazy. Rogue 1 was so superior to this movie it's hard to believe they are in the same shared universe. Some of the dialogue was laughable. Literally. Did I mention Kylo Ren is horrible? I mean he is so beyond stupid and whiny I kept hoping Darth Vader would show up and off him. Then we think we get Luke facing Ren and then....we don't. This had so much potential that was wasted. ","true":true}
