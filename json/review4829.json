Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete Wrong direction for the saga. So much so i dont know if ill bother watching it ever again. Hopefully re reading and veiwing old movies and comics books etc will untarnish the damage that has been done with this diabolical mess.","true":true}
