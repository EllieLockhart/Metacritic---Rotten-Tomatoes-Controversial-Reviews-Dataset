Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Goes in the opposite way a lot of people thought it would. Visually stunning. Has some blatant plot holes. Great acting performances from Mark Hamill. The decision they made with Luke weee controversial\\, but made sense if you take the time to think about it. Has some HUGE surprises. All in all a good movie that could've been great if they had worked out some of those plot problems. I would've given it 4 stars but the Rose and Fin story arc made me drop it a half.","true":true}
