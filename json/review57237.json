Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had some amazing scenes and was gorgeous throughout. Luke Skywalker has forever had his character scarred (to the point that I don't play as him as much in videogames) and I feel that this movie has done damage to the franchise in general.\\n\\nThe movie has many pointless and forgettable characters and moments and tries too hard to be in your face funny\\, which really doesn't suit the Star Wars aesthetic. This movie is frustrating because it has some of the most amazing scenes\\, set pieces and senses of scale\\, but at nearly every opportunity the potential is squandered and is anticlimactic. For every utterly incredible moment (there are several\\, and they feel magically of the true essence of Star Wars)\\, there is one awful\\, pointless or cringey moment to shoot the amazing one down.\\n\\n There was so much potential\\, but this movie has overpowered\\, pointless and forgettable characters for the sake of filling archetypes. What I really want is a Star Wars STORY\\, weaved together with intrigue and intent. Instead I got Star Wars moments\\, taped together with drawn out sequences that don't really make sense and don't add depth to the characters that I care about.\\n\\nIn short\\, beautiful to look at\\, with some amazing parts but just a crying shame that some decisions were made.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker deserved better.","true":true}
