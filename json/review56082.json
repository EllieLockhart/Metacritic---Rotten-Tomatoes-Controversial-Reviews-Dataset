Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Some light spoilers*\\n\\nIt had some really cool scenes. It also had some really cheesy scenes. It closed the door on questions TFA left open without much thought which was disappointing. I have no idea why the critics love this movie. I REALLY wanted to like it. I'm the guy who loved Rogue One and TFA and defended those movies from my friend's criticisms. \\n\\nRain Johnson makes Finn into a joke and Po into an idiot. I don't see what \\\"challenges\\\" they faced other than people sending them in the wrong direction and all their actions being inconsequential.\\n\\nI also didn't really think of this until I saw other critiques on twitter but it did away with the inclusivity of POC as drivers as the main story line and opted to humanize the angsty Kylo Ren without much development of Rey. \\n\\nAlso Luke's end scene makes like no logical sense as to what motivated it and why it had to happen. \\n\\nGlad J.J. has the wheel for the next one. Sad that 3 movies were given to this guy. But then again\\, they gave EA the rights to SW for video games so what can you expect? Disney started off strong with the new Star Wars movies but this is a low point for them. It's a shame. I hope they listen to the fans and improve.","true":true}
