Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the people who I have any problem with this movie i feel sorry for you because you have lost your inner kid. This movie makes me feel like a kid again and I'm playing with my Star Wars toys again","true":true}
