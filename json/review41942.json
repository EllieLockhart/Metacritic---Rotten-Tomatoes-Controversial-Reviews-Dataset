Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, just like the previous The Force Awakens\\, is a fan fiction done by a new director. While visually appealing\\, the character arcs and overall story just don't align with what George Lucas originally created. Had this been a separate story with no ties to the Original Trilogy\\, then it honestly would've done better in my eyes.","true":true}
