Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The nostalgia is no longer mine when it comes to Star Wars. A new generation of fans has picked up the mantel and while I still have strong feelings for my childhood favorite film series\\, it no longer belongs to me and my generation. Star Wars: The Last Jedi affirms the fact that the franchise has transcended what George Lucas created and morphed into something new. Does that mean I didn't enjoy it? No\\, it just means that all things pass and while Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a fine movie\\, it's no longer something I have deep feelings about. https:\/\/futurism.media\/movie-review-star-wars-the-last-jedi?_ga=2.25610493.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710","true":true}
