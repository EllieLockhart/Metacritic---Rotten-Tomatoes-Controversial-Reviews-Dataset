Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short I found this to be a really boring movie\\, it felt way too long\\, it managed to make me not care about any of the new characters and so have no interest or investment in what happens to them. \\n\\nThe plot holes have been well-documented in other reviews and are so glaring as you watch the movie that they take you out of the moment and disengaged from the film. Although some people seem to have wasted considerable time trying to subsequently work out explanations for these plot holes\\, if they mean you don't enjoy the film whilst you are watching it\\, what is the point? \\n\\nFor some reason the ponderous chase plot unfortunately reminded me of the OJ police chase from 94' and just about as ridiculous. \\n\\nLot's been said about the juvenile casino side plot and I so I don't need to explain why I found myself constantly rolling my eyes and looking away from the screen often during this portion of the movie.  \\n\\nAs has also often been noted\\, Rey is two-dimensional with no interesting back story\/characteristics\/development; I like Daisy Ridley as an actress - but what a god awful character for her to work with :( \\n\\nI also hate what they did to Domnhall Gleeson in this\\, I felt so embarrassed for him; he is a way better actor then the dreadful comedic 'Hux' role. It actually made me sad to see him portrayed this way...\\n\\nMy overall impressions:\\n- The acting was good in places (especially Hamill) but the characters (especially Rey) were poorly written. Some of the dialogue was dreadful to the point of making me cringe.\\n- Visually\\, it generally looked good.\\n- Plot was absolutely dreadful\\, lazy and just made for a poor\\, poor experience for me at the cinema.\\n- Humor was more miss than hit and felt really out of place in this.\\n\\nWhen a movie makes you want to walk out and you feel as though you have wasted both your time and money\\, how can I give it more than 1\/2 a star?\\n\\nAs a side note\\, whilst I have read\\, understood and agree with many peoples criticisms of this movie I find a lot less information about why some people also seemed to like this film. Honestly the positive reviews I have read provide very little insights into the 'good' aspects of this movie but rather often seem concerned with insulting or bashing the people who genuinely did not enjoy this experience.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this movie\\, great\\, I respect your opinion\\, please also return the favor to others who really\\, really did not.","true":true}
