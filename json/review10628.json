Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Guys\\, I don't know why this was certified fresh when so much of this film had Empire Strikes Back written all over it. The plot was weak at times\\, and the cheesy\\, kiddy lines and scenes were too much. The villain's death was also predictable\\, but also stupid at the same time. They really disneyfied this movie way too much.","true":true}
