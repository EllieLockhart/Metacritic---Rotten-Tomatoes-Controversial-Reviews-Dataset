Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fresh ideas for Star Wars\\, with plenty of moments that harken back to traditional happenings. The film is a little long\\, and one side plot could probably be excluded completely. However\\, that plot does fit well with the theme of the film of failure and learning. Adam Driver is great and we see some of the series' most memorable moments in this film. Good addition to the series. ","true":true}
