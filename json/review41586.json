Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is fun! What I love about Star Wars\\, is that throughout it's own history there have been bad moments and great one\\, amazing technological advances in movie making and puppetry... Star Wars brings the past and present together into a grab bag of awesomeness. The Last Jedi is a thrill ride and continues a beautiful story.","true":true}
