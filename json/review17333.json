Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I recommend the new Star Wars movie. I can see why the basement dwellers are sitting in the corner by the furnace\\, crying into their Luke Skywalker doll. For the rest of us\\, it's a good movie. :)","true":true}
