Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to write a review of this movie. Best star wars movie\\, period. I don't get why people dislike it so much\\, character arcs made sense\\, the plot was alright\\, and I feel like they did almost everything right. You expect one thing and then BAM\\, NOPE. Awesome movie\\, old star wars fans will never be appeased no matter what. Nostalgia makes everything infinitely better\\, you wanted a star wars movie\\, this is what you got. Best use of my money in a very long time\\, absolutely worth the watch","true":true}
