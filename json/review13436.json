Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I don't understand the hate. I am not a shipper of Reylo. I did see their connection\\, but I also noticed how truly lost Kylo is. He managed to manipulate Rey \\, but she saw through it. In the end\\, she shut the door on him. I feel lik people sometimes like to be apart of the in crowd and put down a movie just because.  Rian Johnson surprised me. I'm looking forward to episode 9.","true":true}
