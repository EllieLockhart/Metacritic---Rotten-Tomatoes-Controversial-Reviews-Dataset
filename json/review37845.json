Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some real strengths and I enjoyed some of it - for example I LIKED how Snoke was killed off by Kylo\\, and I LIKED how Rey's parents were nobody - that was really great IMO.  Kylo was a character so well played and well developed\\, and the interaction between him and Rey was great\\, and just what I would have liked to have seen.  \\nMy issues with the film\\, though\\, especially being a star wars fan\\, left me leaving the cinema feeling ultimately disappointed.  Firstly\\, this was a decent action\/sci-fi movie\\, but it didn't really fit in with the rest of star wars in some fundamental ways. For instance\\, the humor was Marvel-esk\\, and it felt like star wars moulded into another francise - please note\\, movie producers\\, that not everyone loves your formulaic humor!! It is NOT a win-all formula that appeals to everyone!!  Similarly\\, I do consider myself a socially progressive person but that does not mean that  a movie should be a platform for pushing social justice values - that was really really annoying!!  The fight between good and evil is already beautifully symbolic - otherwise the SJ element could at least have been done thoughtfully or cleverly like in Harry Potter & built over several movies not just shoved into one fraction of the franchise.  If I had seen previous star wars movies and known they were using that approach I wouldn't have been in to them!  Aside from other issues that other AUDIENCE reviewers cover (note I don't mind about the Rey\/Snoke thing - I thought that was really cool)\\, the MAIN issue for me was the death of Luke Skywalker.  Okay\\, I acknowledge that it would be essential to kill him off at some point in the near future. But\\, it was such a massive disappointment to see him die without any action on his part.  For me\\, the whole reason that star wars is as interesting and entertaining is seeing characters such as Luke rise up and do their thing - and for Gods sake Luke is meant to be the best of the best. There is a childish appeal to seeing the power\/wisdom etc of the Jedi\\, and in a way that's where so many people get hooked - and Luke was ALWAYS the hero\\, he ALWAYS had a solution and he was totally kickass!!  That's what I wanted to see!!   THAT's where\\, for me\\, this movie became not a star wars movie\\, but something else.  It would have been SO much cooler if Luke had survived\\, shown off some cool skills\\, been the leader\/Jedi Master that he always was\\, and then died doing something else... that is what I was looking forward to most\\, personally\\, and it was very disappointing to see the main character killed off like that - I mean\\, in A New Hope\\, Obiwan dying was fine\\, since he was never a main character in the same way Luke was - what got the audience so enthusiastic about these new movies was finding out what Luke had been up to and seeing his story continue a little bit - I mean you spent a whole damn movie building his entrance up - knowing that people are here for the Jedi touch\/action\/abilities - and then he doesn't do anything and just dies!!! I mean\\, OMG???! That is just so frustrating\\, and not at all in the spirit of where the movies were left off.  It is literally killing off a main character!! Like\\, imagine if during a Marvel movie where the Hulk discovers his powers and the sequel is coming out and the movie is called \\\"The Hulk\\\" and they kill him off in the second scene\\, and are like \\\"well that's just poetry isn't it\\\"! Or this is also like you're watching Captain Planet (I know lame example) and Captain Planet gets killed but the series doesn't finish and they go on to have a different super hero but still call it Captain Planet - it is NOT a continuation of what we had and expected before!!\\nAnyway\\, sorry for the rant\\, & no offence to the people that worked hard to create this\\, but I was very very disappointed by the way this movie went - and it really left my reasons for being a star wars fan untouched and unconsidered.  There were some excellent points\\, but you can't just kill off a beloved\\, main character like that at the wrong wrong time and change the face of a franchise.","true":true}
