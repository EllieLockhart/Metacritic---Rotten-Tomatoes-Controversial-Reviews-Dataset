Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is what happens when you take Star Wars and mix in a spoonful of millennial everyone-gets-a-trophy philosophy. You get heroes who aren't really heroes\\, villains who aren't really villains\\, moral relativism\\, etc\\, etc. That would be fine for a different movie\\, but not for a franchise built upon the idea of heroes\\, lineages\\, and fighting bad guys.\\n\\nWhen one character prevented another from sacrificing himself to save everyone else\\, I knew this movie wasn't for the older generation. I grew up viewing sacrificing oneself to save others as the ultimate act of love\\, but I guess that's not cool anymore. What exactly is the moral there for kids wanting to be a firefighter or a policeman? Are we teaching kids that it's NOT noble to risk yourself to save others? It's just another example of modern philosophy that sounds nice\\, but in reality wouldn't be very noble at all. Imagine a burglar has a gun pointed at your family\\, but a passing police officer says \\\"Sorry\\, but we don't attack what we hate.\\\" and passes by. It's a confusing philosophy that doesn't stand up in the real world. And that example is shockingly accurate to what happens in the movie.\\n\\nThe reason why there is such a huge divide between critics and viewers is because actual Star Wars fans grew up in a day when there were good guys and bad guys\\, and a day when the Jedi had respected and mysterious lineages\\, and would always be there to save the day. Unfortunately\\, story lines involving destiny and lineages aren't popular anymore. We live in an age where everyone get's a trophy\\, and therefore\\, everyone can be a Jedi. \\n\\nIt's not a bad movie for the new generation\\, but this is a story that Disney has already told in more than a few movies already\\, and it didn't fit here.\\n\\nA lot of people still want to believe in heroes.","true":true}
