Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it\\, there was great plot points\\, character development and such Star Wars scenes! Trying to not post spoilers\\, but they did a great job with Ben\\, and made him actually have more of an arc. Didn't notice the length at all until we left\\, except for a constant fear that they were going to leave us on a cliffhanger (sometimes litterealy) -they didn't\\, don't worry! Nice changes and some really great\\, more mature messages throughout\\, sacrifice\\, sometimes it is best to break off rather than a suicidal attack\\,look at the casualties vs the gain and that in tge military they're not always going to tell you everything. Really great messages. Also\\, as expected\\, the trailers really messed with our heads for 'expectations'. One of my favourites and definitely in the top 4.","true":true}
