Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not disappointed because none of the exciting fan theories or speculation were adhered to\\, I even like how the stories of Kylo and Rey are playing out (hence the half star)\\, but this honestly took a dump on what made Star Wars special. I don't know how the \\\"Critics Consensus\\\" could be that this honours the saga's legacy. There is no world building. There is no real struggle. There is no tension. There are minimal meaningful character interactions (only Kylo and Rey). Despite the awful kiddy content\\, dialogue\\, and inconsistencies\\, the prequels at least had these.\\n\\nI'm not even addressing the fact that they ruined Luke.\\n\\nThis is not the Star Wars I was looking for.","true":true}
