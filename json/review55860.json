{"101487":163667,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-10","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Put simply... Last Jedi is a sterile\\, sexless\\, humorless\\, loveless\\, passionless (except Rose and Kylo's tantrums)\\, almost joyless piece of plastic consensus crap. The only characters that feel like they have anything to actually lose or gain are the bad guys (and then only by showing actual consequence for character's actions). Our \\\"heros\\\" fumble to find a universally acceptable (read: antiseptic) moral center from one frenetic scene to the next\\, while spouting vague religious aphorisms and 'subverting expectations' wherever possible. Who grows? Why is no one concerned with BB-8 mowing down humans? What actually changes in this movie from TFA? For all the dying... why is no ever sad except mopey Kylo Ren and forgettable Rose(in one scene)?\\n\\nIt's competently made and manages to find it's feet in moments (the WW2 bombing run homage\\, Rey's version of the cave\\, or the secret to her parentage for example). Just like TFA though\\, it feels like a movie created (a dropped subplot at a time) by test audiences and market research groups (even the \\\"twists\\\"). As a reviewer noted:\\n\\\"Like most of the movie's twists and details\\, it provokes the feeling of subjection to stimuli like a movie-theatre lab rat\\\".\\n\\nI won't even mention how disgusting Luke Skywalker's treatment is (what a waste of a classic character). The New-SW-Movie goggles may stay on for a bit here but mark my words... this movie will not age well (TFA hasn't either but people are less defensive about it).\\n\\nI won't mince words... if this sorrowless\\, joyless\\, corporate-merch strewn cash grab is your idea of Star Wars (or even just sci-fi)\\, you can shove it up your butt. I don't give a hoot what it's supposed to be accomplishing... this is vapid\\, soulless\\, sterile consumerism and they can keep it. I won't pay to see another SW movie or pay a dime for SW branded products from here on. Thanks Disney.","true":true}
