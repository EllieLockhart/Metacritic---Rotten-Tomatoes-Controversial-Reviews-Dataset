Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the negativity from the 'die-hards'. The movie was awesome. It was fresh\\, unique\\, and had surprises left and right. It was the first time I've felt a Star Wars movie since Empire was unpredictable and had taken risks. The 'die-hards' need to let the past be the past. Not every movie can be a re-hash carbon copy of the originals. The biggest complaint against Force Awakens was that it was too much like New Hope. Now\\, a Star Wars movie that has brief touches with the past\\, yet separates itself from the old ways in a refreshing way does not satisfy them. Newsflash\\, you're not going to impress a new generation of fans with the same plot over and over again. Let the originals and the Skywalker narrative be remembered for how great they were\\, and appreciate a new generation of characters and action. This was awesome.","true":true}
