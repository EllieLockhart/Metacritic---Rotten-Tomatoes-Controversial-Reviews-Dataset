Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly beautiful movie. Loved the characterization of the characters and even some that fans hated. Loved Luke\\, Rey and Kylo. War scenes and fight scenes are amazing. Rose and Fins bit in the movie is unnecessary to the plot of the film. Rose herself is an unnecessary character given way too much screen time and importance","true":true}
