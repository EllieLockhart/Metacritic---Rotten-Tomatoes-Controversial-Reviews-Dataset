Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"horribly disappointing. I have been a huge Star Was fan since 1973.. it is what made me interested in doing special effects. this latest installment fails on every level to live up to the star wars universe except the visual effects. visually\\, it's breathtaking\\, but falls flat in story telling\\, character development and respect for the source material.\\n\\nto quote George Lucas (before he did the special editions) \\\"a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing\\\" -from star wars to j6di: the making of a saga (original version)","true":true}
