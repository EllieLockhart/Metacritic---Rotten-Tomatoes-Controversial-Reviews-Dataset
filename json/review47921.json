Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I do understand the controversy around this film\\, as far as fans go\\, I have to say that for me this is one of my favorite films in the rapidly expanding franchise.  I do have some serious critical issues with it\\, which I will address first.  For those who have not seen it yet\\, do so.  The film is too striking\\, and interesting not to see it.  Decide for yourself if you enjoyed it.  \\n\\nSpoilers ahead.\\n\\nThe most glaring flaw for me\\, in the film\\, is Fin's \\\"Side Quest\\\" which accomplishes nothing.  Nada.  Zero.  Nothing about the movie would have been different if he hadn't gone on that mission.  He's a fantastic character\\, and deserved more than a hollow arc that accomplishes nothing practical for the Resistance.  \\n\\nSecondly\\, the storyline about Poe's coup was...  well just kind of weak really.  Meh.\\n\\nThe reason the movie worked so well for me\\, however\\, was the main storyline.  The parallel between Snoak and Ben's relationship\\, and Luke and Rey's.  Both students become disillusioned with their teachers.  Both of them see the same problems with the galaxy\\, and right up until they end\\, both of them -think- that they are on the same page as one and other.  That is a compelling and interesting narrative\\, and when the main storyline works\\, the film works for me.  \\n\\nI don't think everyone has to like this film\\, in fact I think that it's good that people are so divided.  For me\\, it's the best of both worlds\\, because I had an absolute blast watching the film\\, and I love getting into serious discussions about the movie's pros and cons.  I suppose\\, like Rey and Ben\\, fans see all the aspects of the film\\, and draw very different conclusions on what it means to them\\, and to the Star Wars universe\\, as a whole.","true":true}
