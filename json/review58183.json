Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You\u2019ll either hate it or love it. After a 2nd time\\, I loved it. I knew this film would be different going into it. The first 60 minutes of it I was pretty disappointed\\, then they started throwing all sorts of curve balls and surprises. Overall I feel that the unique approach brought a new light to Star Wars that will be interesting to see grow. But just as their is is new light there is new darkness.. could have done with out some of the unnecessary \u201cflying\u201d and comedic breaks... thank you for not just being a fan fare and writing a NEW chapter. This wasnt a rewriting of an old movie with new characters. ","true":true}
