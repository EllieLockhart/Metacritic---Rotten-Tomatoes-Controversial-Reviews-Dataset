Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Contains spoilers*Did not enjoy this movie at all. Not the worse Star Wars movie as some claim but not as great as critics are saying. The writing is sloppy and so many plot holes. I did not see much character development here at all.  Kylo Ren is the least intimidating character in the movie and we need an intimidating presence but with Snoke gone and with Rey being so strong I do not  sense  any real danger for  Rey or the rebellion. I feel like Kylo is the underdog in this movie and he is supposed to be the villain. This is how poor of a villain Kylo is made out to be. What real struggle has Rey truly faced so far? Where is her character growth. Finn was written as a useless character. Poe had more of an impact than Finn in this movie. Vice Admiral Holdo has to be one of the worst admirals and I do not understand  why she could not explain to the crew what her plan was. There was no talk about the possibility of a spy being on board or no explanation on why she chose not to share her plans. It boils down to poor leadership and poor writing. The writers chose to write Vice Admiral Holdo as incompetent just to send Finn and Rose to  Canto Bight. I can see why they wanted to introduce Canto Bight to show that the universe is not just black and white and that the arms dealers are selling to both sides but it could have been done some other way.  Now Luke Skywalker was the biggest disappointment . Okay I can get over the fact that he became a recluse bitter old man\\, but they made him a coward to. He should have faced Kylo in person and faced his failure as a teacher. But instead he sent a force projection of himself avoiding confronting his student face to face and also his sister. Now that I think about it this is one of the worst Star Wars movie.  Ill give it two because I stayed awake and saw all of it.","true":true}
