Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a strong set up by JJ Abrams\\, Rian Johnson's film is just a story telling disaster.  I'm not even sure what I should be waiting or wanting to see in Episode IX.  It didn't move the story along or do any substantial character development except to put a crap finish on Luke Skywalker's character.   And worst of all it took everything great about Star Wars and basically thumbed its nose at it.  With the success of Rogue One and even Force Awakens\\, why the sudden tone deafness to the reverence due to this franchise?  Just disgusted.","true":true}
