Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't the triumphant return of Luke Skywalker that I had hoped it would be. And this movie is bad because it avoided the standard Star Wars tropes. It was bad because it had plot holes\\, poor pacing\\, and no reverence for what the original trilogy or the Force Awakens established before it. I'm not sure what this movie was or why there's this sudden agenda to turn Star Wars on it's head and establish something new. The conflicts here weren't rewarding\\, and in the hands of a better director or writer\\, would could have had something very impactfull to the series. Instead what we got was what felt like a Guardians of Galaxy like take at established characters leaving everything feeling very out place in this universe.","true":true}
