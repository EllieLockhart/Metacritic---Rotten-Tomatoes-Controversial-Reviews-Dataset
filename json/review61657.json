I really don't understand how anyone can dislike this game after finishing it.\rIt is the perfect sequel and it gives a perfect closure to Joel and Ellie`s story.\r********SPOILER ALERT********\rif you didn`t finish the game don`t read the following\r\rI know that many people are not going to read this but for those who actually finished the game and did not understand the ending (or doesn`t know how to feel about it)\\, I will leave you with an analysis that may be useful to some:\r\rEllie's hatred for Abby is an external reflection of Ellie's self-hatred.\rJoel deeply hurt Abby and Ellie in different ways and they both punished him for it. Ellie hates Abby for torturing Joel to death\\, especially since she didn't have a chance to restore her relationship with Joel. This is a parallel to her situation with Ellie because she also tortured Joel\\, she did it for years but in a different way\\, and I would say that in a more painful way for Joel\\, and that was to disconnect from him. Ellie hates herself for torturing him like this and for not restoring their relationship when there was still time. That is the real pain that she has been trying to avoid facing throughout this quest for revenge\\, she is like a \\\"junkie\\\" who uses revenge to avoid dealing with those painful feelings of regret. This is the vision she has while she is drowning Abby (when she has the flashback of the scene on the porch with Joel) and chooses not to kill her. She is not only forgiving Abby\\, but more importantly forgiving herself and finally coming to a resolution as to what happened between her and Joel\\, I think Ellie leaving her guitar leaning against the window and walking away symbolically represents that she has forgiven Joel\\, and she made peace with what happened between them and she's finally ready to move on and start a new life.\r\rWhen I finished The Last Of Us Part II for the first time\\, I felt empty and honestly\\, I didn't know what to feel\\, whether I liked it or not\\, but after much deliberation\\, I think it is truly a masterpiece.\r\rPeople who say the game is just about \\\"revenge=bad\\\" or that the ending \\\"feels utterly\\, hopelessly pointless\\\"\\, I think they really didn't get it (or didn't play it). Because this game is about forgiveness.\r\rThis game is not at all what the fans expected\\, but I think that's what makes it so great.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
