Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the midnight screen with an OMG and I can't believe that just happened vibe.. As a big fan of Star Wars I still feel a little confused about some of the plot but if you are a casual fan who just wants to see an awesomely shot\\, funny and sometimes emotional blockbuster this is the movie for you. May the force be with you.. ??","true":true}
