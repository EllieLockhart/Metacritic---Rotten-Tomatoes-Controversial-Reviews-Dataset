Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was everything I was afraid it was going to be. Disappointing answers to interesting questions. The whole second act was long and pointless. It ended the momentum gathered by the last two movies and felt like it was rebooting the whole franchise again with whiny emo kids in the lead. \\n\\nI could have looked past all of this if the ending was not so infuriating. Such an uncaring way to treat an iconic character and all of the people who grew up with the original trilogy. Thirty years and  I have still yet to see anything a mind blowing jedi sequences. \\n\\nThe director said he was a fan of the prequels and it shows. Instead of an alien nascar race we get a cruel horse or dog race. The Canto setting was like watching the special edition of Jabba's musical concert. \\n\\nI commend the director for taking chances but the end result was very underwhelming. At least it was better than Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
