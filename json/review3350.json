Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"benicio del toro story arc was useless. story would still be the same without him. too many plot holes left and right. and they have officialy thrown away all the pre established rules about space combat...the lore...etc. Bottom line: they promised to answers\\, you leave the theater with more questions","true":true}
