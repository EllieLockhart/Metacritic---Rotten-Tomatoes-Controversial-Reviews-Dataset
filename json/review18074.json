Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it embraced what made the original Star Wars trilogy great\\, while also embracing the new.  The cinematography was obviously stunning\\, however\\, the story lacked a little.  I do look forward to see what the next trilogy brings.","true":true}
