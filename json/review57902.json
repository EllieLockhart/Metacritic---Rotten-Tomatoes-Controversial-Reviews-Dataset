Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a joke of a script!! How Luke Skywalker was treated in this movie was a disgrace to the character. The entire Finn\/Rose storyline of the movie served NO purpose to the movie at all. Things that were set up in episode 7 were had no mention or even furtherance of any kind. The movie was overly jokey and even preachy at times. I don\u0092t care about your social justice\/animal rights heavy handed bull sh*t. R2-D2 and C-3PO\\, the characters who are a substantial part of the saga and kicked off the story\\, were wasted and criminally underused. The script was all over the place and a mess. Visually the movie was amazing. Mark Hamill gave the performance of his career\\, although his character was treated like a damn joke. If this is the direction the Star Wars franchise is going Lucasfilm\/Disney has another thing coming. Again I can\u0092t stress how terribly the character of the hero of our galaxy Luke Skywalker was handled. I was very hyped for this movie but ultimately I am disappointed and ashamed that this is now Star Wars cannon. I enjoyed the call backs but this was not a good script. The movie was entertaining at times but a mess and a disservice to fans of a galaxy far far away. I\u0092m not looking forward to the next episode the way I was walking out of the movie theater two years ago. - Devin Bell","true":true}
