Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to say this movie ruined my childhood Star Wars because those movies are still great to me. But after this terrible story I do not care about any of the new characters or what their fate is\\, will not spend any more money on Disney's interpretation of Star Wars.","true":true}
