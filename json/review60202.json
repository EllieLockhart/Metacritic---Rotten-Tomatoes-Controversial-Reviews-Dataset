The sequel had a strong emotional bond with me .2) My total game time for TLOU 2 is 24 hours with good amount of exploration.3) Started the game with lots of expectations and saw only one review and one gameplay video before starting the game . ( Never ventured into the spoilers **** )4) Played the game on a base PS4.5) The review will be broken into different aspects with a final score and a simple verdict.So let's go on 1) Graphics - I am not going to talk much about the graphics as almost everyone knows how the game looks . The playstation 4 has been pushed to it's limits to achieve the graphic outrage . However the attention to detail is little underwhelming and I personally found 6 visual bugs in the whole game which can be ignored and will definitely be patched. Rating - 9\/10 2) Gameplay - The gameplay took on the foundations of the prequel with lots of tweaks.  The AI is more responsive . The guns and their upgrades are more accurate however few upgrades are not worth your tools . There is more variety in the fire arms u carry . There are many skill trees and u can upgrade the path as ur favourite play style. But on the negative side sometimes the gameplay appears too similar to the prequel . Also the game is very challenging at the start but as u progress forward it becomes too easy and even ur upgrade paths and skill tree acquisition also becomes very easy . Rating - 8\/10 Story - the part that's in most of the debates and discussion since and before the game release . The director definitely took many bold steps in the story . There are many set pieces which are difficult to digest\\, I personally found few story parts very very hard to digest and these are the things that has been garnering negative reviews . But the story is very well told and is a emotional roller coaster ride.  I enjoyed every part of the story . It's raw \\, gritty and not a fairy tale that has been told . My heart raced \\, my skin got goosebumps \\, my eyes got tears and my mouth went dry on this story .Rating - 9.5\/10 Music - I simply lost in the music of this game . I personally feel this category is the best part of the game Rating - 10\/10 . Over-all Rating - Little more than 9 and a little less than 9.5FINAL VERDICT - AS I FINISHED THE GAME MY DAUGHTER ASKED ME WHY ARE TEARS ROLLING IN MY EYES . THAT SAYS MY VERDICT ON THIS GAME .\u2026 Expand","true":true}
