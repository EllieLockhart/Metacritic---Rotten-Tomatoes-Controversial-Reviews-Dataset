{"101487":150105,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally have never before reviewed a movie in my life\\, but I felt the need to share for this one due to the wave of critics saying star wars diehards will love this movie. They could not be more wrong. \\n\\nI'm A HUGE Star wars fan. Grew up loving the movies\\, both trilogies\\, I've seen them all dozens of times. People can bad talk the prequels all they want\\, and a lot of the stuff was janky\\, I'll admit it. But they felt like Star wars movies. The last Jedi does not. If you like Star wars and think the lore is cool\\, this movie will let you down\\, it is not a Star wars movie. I feel like Rian Johnson reached deep into my heart\\, found my childhood love of star wars and then proceeded to rip it out and light it on fire in front of my eyes while justifying it with a lecture about \\\"letting the past die\\\" and \\\"bold new directions\\\". I found the callouts to the Lucas movies\\, characters\\, and lore to be mocking and disrespectful. The message of moving forward could have been communicated in a far more tactful and elegant way. It's not what happened in the movie that's a letdown\\, it's how it all happens...\\n\\nIf you love star wars\\, lightsaber fights\\, and Luke Skywalker this movie will almost certainly disappoint you. This is not a Star wars movie to me. It's a butchery of my childhood heros and fantasies. I feel betrayed\\, let down\\, and pessimistic that the magic of star wars will be around in the future.","true":true}
