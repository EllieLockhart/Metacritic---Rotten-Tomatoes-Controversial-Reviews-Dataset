Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was absolutely stunning and a breath of fresh air for the franchise as a whole. Rian took some risks with this one and they surely paid off in my book\\, but many apparently do not share my view. I am not here to knock anyone else's opinion but please see this film for yourself and not miss out based off someone else's negativity! Overall I laughed\\, I cried\\, I had goosebumps\\, and I surely didn't know what was going to happen next!! Very well could be the best film in the saga\\, don't miss out!","true":true}
