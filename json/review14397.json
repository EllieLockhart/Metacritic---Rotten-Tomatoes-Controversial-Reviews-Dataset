Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for TLJ going in\\, and while it did prove to be better than TFA (not a high bar) it ended up doing more damage long run in the destruction of Luke Skywalker's character. The Ben\/Rey stuff was great\\, Canto Bight was wholly unnecessary. It really appears the new directors\/KK are only concerned with the new characters and are pushing the old ones out by any means necessary.","true":true}
