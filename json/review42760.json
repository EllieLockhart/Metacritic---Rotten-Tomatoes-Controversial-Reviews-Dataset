Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrible. The tone was completely different from the tone of previous movies in the series and even other media. Several main characters did things never before alluded to and completely out of character. There were story lines that did not contribute anything to the overall story and a very awkward scenes played for humor that landed flat. Flying through space like marry Poppins\\, nearly nude force facetime\\, Luke being totally broken\\, really dumb prank phonecall\\, and a potential child murderer as well as never getting into the action make this movie very bad. Will not watch anymore of these movies.","true":true}
