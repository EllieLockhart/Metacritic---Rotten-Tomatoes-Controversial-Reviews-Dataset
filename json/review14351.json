Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess one needs to be totally buried in all the \\\"new extended universe lore\\\"\\, books like the Aftermath series\\, animated series like Rebels and Clone Wars to not think the whole film is a giant plot hole\\, but to be honest\\, for me\\, who have read a lot of the new books and seen the animated series and all that\\, everything pretty much comes together and works out into a great movie. And I actually begin to really like the new EU\\, even though I still miss the old one that was cut away by the new Lucas Film Story Group. It's still very much Star Wars\\, even though it is a much more dynamic universe now than it has ever been before. I look forward to seeing where this goes in the next installment in 2019.","true":true}
