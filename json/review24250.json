Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. This felt like as much of a jumbled mess as TFA. It's not *terrible* but there are better Star Wars movies. Unless the next movie really blows everything out of the water\\, this new trilogy will be remembered on par with the prequel trilogy.","true":true}
