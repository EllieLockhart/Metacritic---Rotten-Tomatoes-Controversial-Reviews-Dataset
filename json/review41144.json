Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a terrible plot and childish characters. The SWU has lost a huge opportunity to expand its universe and damaged itself so hard that I am in doubt about the future of this franchise\\, unless this movie is rebooted. Besides the cosmopolitan environment. I didn`t care if the characters were a strong woman or not\\, or its ethnicity. The characters are just bad as does the plot. I`ve left the theaters completely sad and won`t be watching anything on it until I see severe changes on this franchise.","true":true}
