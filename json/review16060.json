Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long time Star Wars fan and this is now my favorite episode. I'm glad the series has been taken in a new direction and has still remained true to the universe\/fundamentals. I found Luke's story to be completely in his character. I loved the answer to Rey's parentage. I also love the idea of balance.","true":true}
