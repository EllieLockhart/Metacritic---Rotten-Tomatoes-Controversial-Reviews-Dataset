Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The effects and action fan service were fantastic. However\\, the substance of the plot\\, and every branching thread ended up being a massive disappointment\\, and the attempts to cover up the previous movie's minor plot holes only served to pronounce their issues and create new ones. The only saving grace to the atrocious writing was the actor's commitment to making the characters as exciting and engaging as possible. Daisy Ridley (Rey) and Adam Driver (Kylo) were particularly amazing this time around. To conclude this\\, I'd also like to call out that this movie should've ended 20 minutes earlier\\, at the height of tensions and conflict\\, to at least let us leave the theater with a desire to see more... Instead of having the only reason we went to see this movie die in such an ungratifying\\, bitter tasting manner.","true":true}
