Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie looks like a starwarsy film\\, but BEWARE! it\u00b4s just Disney makeup!\\, beneath a flimsy holey plot lies poor and strange character development\\, specially for Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. The movie is not well written and the pacing is off beat\\, intermingling dark scenes with cheapguardiansofthegalaxy humor and a casino subplot that nothing has to do with the movie at hand.","true":true}
