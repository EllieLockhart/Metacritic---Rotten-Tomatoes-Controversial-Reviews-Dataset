Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall utterly disappointed. So many basic and important plot points are completely nonsensical.  Pacing and tone is all over the place and completely undercuts important moments.  It has killed my excitement for any further Star Wars main line story films.","true":true}
