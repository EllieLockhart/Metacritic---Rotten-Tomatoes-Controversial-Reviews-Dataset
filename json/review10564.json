Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals and cinematography. Mark Hamill's performance makes the movie. There were a couple of great locations and scenarios that sadly were not used to their full potential.\\nThen there's lots of the \\\"meh\\\". Plot holes\\, filler and unfinished stories from the previous movie. The abandonment of what makes Star Wars\\, Star Wars. All to take the franchise in some Disneyesque direction. This is change for change's sake and it spoiled the experience.","true":true}
