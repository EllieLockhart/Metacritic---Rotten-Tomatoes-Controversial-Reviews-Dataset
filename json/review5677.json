Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did RJ actually watch episode 7 before he made this and or the previous 6 films?  Because it doesn't look like it.  Plot holes and poor writing have literally ruined the franchise and any sort of emotional attachment to the legacy of Star Wars with respect to the lore.","true":true}
