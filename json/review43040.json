Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very anticipated by fans to provide breadth and depth to new characters\\, and to further elucidate the new status of the galaxy. Instead\\, it cemented that the new direction of the franchise is to turn it into superficial fluff for kids\\, with little meaningful plot. Cheap laughs here and there\\, mostly with inappropriate timing. The new characters remain underdeveloped and shallow. This movie not only provides little foundation or intrigue for episode 9\\, but retrospectively torpedoes The Force Awakens since it thrashes any meaning to the events of that film. \\nAt least the prequels had a consistent and meaningful lead plot line\\, even if there was too much fluff and poorly acted sequences. This movie is essentially less than what a collection of any 5 random fans could have put together and leaves the franchise in tatters. Except for 7 year olds. Disney will have their attention for a while longer until the next fleeting thought.","true":true}
