Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This website's audience is a trolling JOKE. It's laughable. The Last Jedi audience score on Rotten Tomatoes: 57% (84\\,655 ratings)\\, IMDB: 8.0 (80\\,052 ratings). I'm never going to take this site's audience score seriously ever again..","true":true}
