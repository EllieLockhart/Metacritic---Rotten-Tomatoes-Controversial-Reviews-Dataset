Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way to destroy Luke Skywalkers character... Rian Johnson is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars since Lucas added all his CG garbage in '97. Giving it a 2 because Frank Oz and his Yoda was great also the light dark teamup was pretty good...","true":true}
