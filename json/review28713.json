Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Put simply\\, The Last Jedi simply compounds the big picture structural issues that were set in motion by The Force Awakens. The Force Awakens brought us into a Star Wars galaxy that simply didn't make sense continuity wise. How the hell is there still a resistance? The rebels won last time! Twice! It is preposterous that the events of the original three movies had no appreciable effect on the galaxy.\\n\\nYet\\, in order to tell the story Disney wanted to tell\\, it had to be this way. A hero's journey needs simple\\, binary conflict. Disney believes audiences need to to see a pure evil\\, authoritarian oppressor and a scrappy underdog in order to the story to be compelling. This is total BS\\, of course. Not only does is making the good guys the underdogs again laughable given the events of the first trilogy\\, its a boring\\, safe choice. Imagine a Star Wars 7 where the regular \\\"Rebels fight Imperial oppression\\\" narrative is flipped on its head; The Republic is on top\\, but faces the looming threat of Imperial terrorists. THATS doing something different. But no\\, simple-minded star wars fans can't enjoy a movie unless their cheering for the underdog. This issue is\\, as I said\\, compounded ten-fold in The Last Jedi; the rebels are pushed down even further\\, all but eliminated. \\n\\nThis issue wouldn't be so awful if it wasn't for the huge big issue this new trilogy has: the absolute pathetic villains. The original trilogy gave us Darth Vader\\, easily one of the most intimidating and interesting villains of all time. Even the prequels gave us Darth Maul and Count Dooku\\, two formidable characters in their own right. Here? The rebels\\, led by supposed badass Rey\\, are getting the snot beat out of them by Snoke\\, a bizarre looking cgi abomination we know nothing about\\, Hux\\, a laughably ineffectual commander that gets respect from no-one\\, and\\, worst of all\\, Kylo-Ren\\, an angsty My Chemical Romance fan who has whiny temper tantrums every ten minutes. These are the characters we're supposed to fear? \\n\\nGive me a break. I'm sorry\\, but anyone who enjoys these new movies has just been taken for a ride by Disney. Its high time we let Star Wars die and let a new sci-fi epic come to the fore.","true":true}
