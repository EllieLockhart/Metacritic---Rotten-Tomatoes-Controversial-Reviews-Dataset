Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste. Have any of the writers or director ever taken a course on how to make a movie? The whole Finn and Rose story of leaving the fleet was a total waste of time that added ZERO to the movie. This plot wasted half a movie. The only good parts of the film were Luke and Yoda\\, Luke's lightsaber duel and the touching scene with Hamill and Fisher together one last time.","true":true}
