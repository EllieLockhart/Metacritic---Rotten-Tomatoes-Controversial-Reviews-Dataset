Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't have a dozen preconceived notions of what this movie should be\\, that's part of why I think this movie has been so harshly dealt with by the fans. I love the direction they are taking things and this is just a beautiful movie. I made an account here just to offset some of the hate on it.","true":true}
