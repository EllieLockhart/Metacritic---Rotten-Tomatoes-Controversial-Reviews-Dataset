Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I entered the theater to sit down and watch the next installment in the Star Wars movie saga\\, I was excited to see where the film would take the beloved characters greatly introduced by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens. After such a good set up at the end of Episode VII\\, how could Rian Johnson and Lucasfilm (Disney) mess up the next film? When I left the theater\\, I was speechless\\, because I was amazed. I was amazed that they had actually screwed it up. Not only did the movie kill off Luke skywalker in the silliest way possible\\, turn Princess Leia into a space Mary poppins (well it is Disney I guess) and fill it with Ewok knock-offs\\, it was plagued by terrible jokes which frankly no one in my theater laughed at\\, and an abundance plot holes. It's good that the movie included much needed diversity to the Star Wars universe\\, but that doesn't mean it's a good movie. Also\\, the whole Canto Bight adventure with Finn and Rose was just a overdrawn political statement which should have been left out of the movie.","true":true}
