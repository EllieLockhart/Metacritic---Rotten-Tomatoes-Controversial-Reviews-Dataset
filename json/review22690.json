Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like others I opened up an account here just so I could voice my dissapointment with this movie. I'm a big fan and Disney did a great job with The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, but this movie is in the Jar Jar Binks catagory. Extremely lazy with dialog and character development. The director has these talented actors acting like goofballs and fools. I feel like they phoned this one in to get our money at Christmas time. Even my 17 year old daughter and 14 and 8 year old sons commented on the silliness of the characters and story. Lazy\\, lazy\\, lazy Mr. Rian Johnson. Seems like this movie was made by a 10 year old\\, not for a 10 year old. Johnson messed up everything JJ Abrams set up for us. Kathleen Kennedy\\, you made a mistake\\, now bring back JJ Abrams to fix it again and restore balance to the Star Wars fans. Very excited to see it\\, now I'm totaled bummed. Sorry Disney\\, won't be buying this one for the collection...","true":true}
