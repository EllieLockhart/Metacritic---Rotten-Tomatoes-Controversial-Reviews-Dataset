Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pesar de sus inconsistencias con el resto de la saga\\, y sus personajes acartonados\\, la direcci\u00f3n es sublime. T\u00e9cnicamente es una de las mejores de toda la saga\\, sus efectos especiales cuidados a detalle adem\u00e1s de su extraordinaria direcci\u00f3n de arte y vestuarios la hacen un deleite. Mejor de lo que esperaba. Bien hecho.","true":false}
