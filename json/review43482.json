Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was awful...\\nThey destroyed beloved characters from the OT.  They went absolutely nowhere with ANY of the interesting plot elements introduced in TFA.  They failed to give Rey any challenges or weaknesses to overcome\\, she's just OP for no reason.  They tried to lift up their female characters by making the men look like idiots.\\nThere's a reason this movie divided such a loving fanbase\\, and the results were seen with the Box Office failure of Solo.  \\nThere's no way this trilogy can be saved after tossing everything interesting in the trash and going for the \\\"subverts expectations\\\" junk.  It didn't work here\\, and didn't work for GoT.  Just stop it.  \\n","true":true}
