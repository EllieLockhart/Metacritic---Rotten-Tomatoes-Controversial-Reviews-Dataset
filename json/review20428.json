Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I usually don't do movie reviews\\, but I'm making an exception for this one.\\n\\nI'll just come out and say it... It was bad. I mean\\, really bad. I felt like I was  watching a Transformers movie with an even worse plot. Not that there was much of a plot anyway. They could have called this movie \\\"A Bunch of People Die in Space\\,\\\" because that's basically all that happens. A bunch of people get killed in laser fights\\, some crazy hermit drinks green milk from an alien's titty\\, and an emo kid cries about his abusive father figure. The End. \\n\\nIt wasn't just the plot that was bad\\, though. Some things about this movie actually affected me mentally. Like whenever there is a serious battle scene happening\\, they keep inserting these stupid\\, cringy jokes that actually made me feel embarrassed just for watching this retarded trash. I'm glad I torrented a cam version of this movie and didn't actually pay for a ticket. They don't deserve a dime for this pile of puke.\\n\\nIf I could give it 0 stars\\, I would have given it -10.\\n\\n F!@# you\\, Disney. I hope I live to see you go out of business.","true":true}
