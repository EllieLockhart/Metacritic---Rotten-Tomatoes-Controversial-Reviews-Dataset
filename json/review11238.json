Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly?  Kinda terrible. The writers have no idea what a character arc means.  \\n\\nCertain characters who had incredible potential from a story perspective have nothing but yelling to contribute. Where is the character development?  \\n\\nThe 90% of critics who liked this movie don't know what they are talking about.","true":true}
