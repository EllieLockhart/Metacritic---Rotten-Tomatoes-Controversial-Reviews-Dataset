Its not the story players wanted. BELIEVE ME. but its the story the game needed to tell. This game was designed to make you uncomfortable to fit with the overall theme being HATE. remember that. Clocked out at almost 27 hours with the game. The two main characters of this sequel are consumed by hate. It clouds all judgement and leads them down the paths that they took. Gameplay wise. I don't know if I've ever played a game this polished and superb. Everything you do in the game has weight to it\\, and its phenomenal to handle. It is a refined version of the first game and that's absolutely okay. If ever they were to do a third game this sequel sets that up. If the first game was about love and this sequel was a grueling tale of hate. Then what follows is hope. So please\\, play through the game yourselves. give it your attention. It deserves at least that.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
