Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Episode VII came out I was under the impression they were setting things up to portray the old heroes as nothing but losers... I wish I could say I  was prepared for what they had in mind for us this time around. No way I could have foreseen to which degree they would degrade the heroes of old (particularly Luke Skywalker) and the Skywalker bloodline in this movie.\\n\\nWhen it ended I thought at first that I would leave the movie theather feeling sad or even angry about it\\, but\\, in the end\\, I didn't. I felt indifferent. I don't care about it anymore. Nor does my girlfriend\\, my mother and nor does my 12 years old brother.\\n\\nStar Wars is over\\, this new Disney stuff is a joke and we the fans are the clowns.","true":true}
