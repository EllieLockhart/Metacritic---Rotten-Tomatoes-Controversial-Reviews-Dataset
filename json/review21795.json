Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just came from the movies and have to say. AMAZING! The plot is awesome. It has its little issues BUT not sharing any spoilers I enjoyed the movie\\, some scenes left my mouth open. Luke in my opinion died the perfect death (sorry didn't mean to spoil it). I recommend to watch.","true":true}
