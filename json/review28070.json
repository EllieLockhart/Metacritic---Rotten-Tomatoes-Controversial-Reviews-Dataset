Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot is full of pointless\\, unrealistic characters. Humour destroys the characters built on in the previous movies. And they kill Admiral Akbar and leave the job of saving the alliance to Vice-Admiral Gender Studies\\, who proceeds to not tell anyone her plan and get half the rebels killed before killing herself. Made no sense\\, only beat the Phantom Menace in acting.","true":true}
