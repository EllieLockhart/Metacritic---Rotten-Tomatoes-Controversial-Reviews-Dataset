Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This had the potential to be a classic in the franchise\\, but there are some killer flaws that really hamper this movie. Non-sensical side plots\\, new  but completely uninteresting support characters\\, and a largely derivative main story are only saved by some of the best Star Wars moments from any of the eight films so far.\\n\\nI applaud the director for making some bold choices\\, but he also needs to take the wrap for the fact that many of them do not pay off. \\n\\nOverall\\, what we have here is something reminiscent of the prequels. It gets certain moments right but as a whole\\, is a bit of a mess. This will divide the fan base for years to come.","true":true}
