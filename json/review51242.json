Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely no love\\, appreciation or knowledge for 30 years of story development. Movie manages to be incrdibly long\\, while not explaining anything. Plot wholes everywhere\\, unecessary scenes and characters take up at least 1\/3 of the movie.","true":true}
