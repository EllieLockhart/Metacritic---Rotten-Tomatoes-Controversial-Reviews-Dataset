Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely one of my favorites of the whole Star Wars Universe! I think for them to try not to copy older movies (one of the complaints that people gave for 7). I think it was really good\\, they made some nods to older movies but didn't copy it. Feel the audience Score (at the time of review of 56) is wrong and its just super fans complaining because stuff didn't go the way they expected.","true":true}
