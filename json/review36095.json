Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a complete disappointment.  It is the weakest plot of any Star Wars movie.  Chasing a Rebel ship the entire movie and leaving Luke Skywalker on a island to milk a space alien is sad and shameful.  Can you image if Leia or Han had to milk the tit of a space alien?  The Canto Bight distraction was a complete waste of time.  Free the space horses and leave the slave children.  Great move.  The Last Jedi is not a Star Wars movie.  It contains a few Star Wars characters and the majority of the movie is a mash of Harry Potter wizardry\\, Fast & Furious non-sense\\, and Guardians of the Galaxy fragmentation.  The Stars Wars Canon deserves better.","true":true}
