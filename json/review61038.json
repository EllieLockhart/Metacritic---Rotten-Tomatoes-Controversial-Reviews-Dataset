It was too late for their garbage rhetoric to change and\/or Druckmann was in it for the end game. Although\\, ND and Sony no doubt still want to turn a profit\\, so they lied and connived this b.s. game and hid stuff and changed things for trailers to sucker in the old fans. Good on you\\, you suckered a lot of fans. But in the long run\\, will it really be worth it?\rI'll NEVER buy a ND game again. I won't be buying a PS5. I won't ever buy another Sony product in general\\, because they attacked youtubers livelihood and during a pandemic of all times!! That's some bad will you can never erase.\rAnd if this is one of the \\\"exclusives\\\" on PS\\, WGAF!?\rI'm only annoyed I'll lose all my GTA V progress and hundreds of dollars on megalodon cards I've bought. MY PS Plus membership ends at the end of this year and that's when I'll say goodbye to Playstation. I'm disgusted with you as a company. The game was bad enough\\, but I could have wrote it off to Druckmann and maybe still boycotted ND. But after what Sony pulled on behalf of this **** game\\, I'm out! And unlike Ellie\\, I believe in 2 eyes for an eye and then I'll cut your throat!\r\rI still say Druckmann leaked this himself because after firing testers and going home and looking at his Manny face in the mirror\\, he realized how epicly he f'ed up and was going to have to answer for it shortly. He couldn't keep delaying the game for no reason\\, so he leaked it. Figured he could hide behind the umbrella of anyone who doesn't like this game is an \\\"-ist\\\" or a \\\"-phobe\\\"\\, but when people weren't buying that tired b.s. argument\\, he had no recourse and couldn't be the martyr he wanted to be.\r\rI also believe his goal was to release this Father's Day weekend. Down with the patriarchy and the toxic white males and at the hands of their own tool of \\\"privilege\\\"\\, a golf club. Neil showing us young girls don't need toxic male fathers or father figures in their lives! Bravo\\, Neil! Stunning and brave! 10\/101!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
