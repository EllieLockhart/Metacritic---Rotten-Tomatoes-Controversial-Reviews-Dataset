Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG just saw the the movie\\, I don't even want to call it star wars bc that would be an insult. Trying to erase it from memory as I type. Worst movie in series ever\\, Rogue one blew this out the water. What a trash can. I would have rather sat through a rerun of empire strikes back than watch this care bear mislead crap. Kill every bad guy in the second episode of this series of bad guys wow\\,  so whats next for episode 9? flowers hugs and kylo getting killed within first 5 minutes. Wow what a waste of time","true":true}
