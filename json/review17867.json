Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It hardly \\\"ruined the franchise\\\" like some suggest\\, but it's a terrible film. The two main issues that I have with it is the pacing and the forced humor. Those two glaring flaws bleed into every disjointed decision\\, magnifying the impact. I've watched every SW film dozens of times a year. TLJ I've watched 2.5 times ... couldn't even finish a third viewing.","true":true}
