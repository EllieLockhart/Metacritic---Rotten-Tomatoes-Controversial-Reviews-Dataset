Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was mad after seeing this. I heard it was not good but i didn't think it was going to be that stupid. The Leia flying through space and the way they killed Luke was AWFUL! Don't waste your time or money on this piece of trash.","true":true}
