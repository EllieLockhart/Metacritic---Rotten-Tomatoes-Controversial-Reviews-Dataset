The game mechanics and general gameplay is absolutely fantastic. Although its no surprise that the story has made the game unplayable. The character inconsistentcies make for a confusing plot line. The general lazy writing has unveiled a very generic story about revenge and its consequences. The decision to change the playable character was a poor one. WhenThe graphics are stunning.

When playing as Abby I just wanted for it to over. I understood the reason for making abby a playable character\\, but it just didn't bode well with hardcore fans of the first game. I didn't enjoy the story. To sum up The Last Of Us Part 2: It is a huge disappointment that leaves players unfulfilled in the end. To add\\, the best part of the game which was the game mechanics and gameplay\\, was a copy and paste of Uncharted 4. It is not a very good game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
