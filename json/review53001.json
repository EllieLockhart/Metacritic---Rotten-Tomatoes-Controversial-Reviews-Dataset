Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of all things Star Wars\\, I have the same disappointed feeling I experienced back when the Phantom Menace released. Excitement for new Star Wars experiences and confusion\/disappointment from what I had just seen. To be sure it had all the elements I wanted to see\\, great set pieces\\, battles\\, good vs bad\\, rebels and empires\\, and yet\\, it all felt so hollow. Let's get real for a moment\\, the length of this movie is it's biggest fault\\, it's overbearing and overwrought\\, you could have easily shaved a good hour\\, and still could have had perhaps a better There were some storylines that did not deserve the attention they got\\, and some should have never been added at all. The characters which felt like fleshed out archetypes in Force Awakens are now starting to feel like bad caricatures of themselves. Kylo Ren has been turned into a sad cartoon villain\\, which is a shame because he was genuinely one of the more interesting characters from Force Awakens\\n\\nThe entire second act was just a vapid cinematic wasteland of bad tropes\\, unsurprising twists\\, barely their actor chemistry and the most throwaway plotline in the entire movie\\, and that's saying something with the boring as paint drying Poe Dameron storyline. \\n\\nIf this is the direction that Disney\/Lucasfilm decides to take the future of the franchise\\, I'm a bit scared\\, be honest.\\n\\nThe movie wasn't all bad though\\, for instance\\, the 1st act was very exciting and visually stupendous\\, the final act\\, while hampered a bit by some questionable story choices was very satisfying in the end\\, and also visually interesting. I would rank this somewhere between Return of the Jedi and Attack of the Clones","true":true}
