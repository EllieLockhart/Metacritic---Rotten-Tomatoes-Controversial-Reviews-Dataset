Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed starwars for me and broke my heart. I have zero interest in episode 9 now. This movie retroactively made the force awakens WORTHLESS\\, instead of giving it deeper meaning. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should be fired and never allowed to make another starwars film as long as they live.","true":true}
