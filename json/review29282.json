Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey = Mary Sue\\nRose = Jar Jar \\n\\nThis Movie is Story wise the worst Star Wars Movie!\\nYeah i get it the visuals are fantastic but the visuals are only a small portion for the succes of a Movie!\\n\\nThe Characters are tottaly boring!\\nRey can do everything has zero to none flaws\\, no training and can allready beat Snokes guards BULLSHIT and can use the force to movie so many rocks BULLSHIT!\\nand Luke! LUKE!\\nThat is definitely #NotMyLuke\\nThey sacrificed Luke so that Rey could shine BULLSHIT!\\nSuperman Leia...\\nFinn get saved by Rose!\\nLUKE DIYNG FOR NOTHING!!!!\\n\\nFeminist\\, SJW\\, PC......BULLSHIT!!!\\n\\nIf you like this Movie you only push an agenda and dont care about good movies.","true":true}
