Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost as bad as the prequels. (No spoilers)\\n\\nI am a huge Star Wars fan\\, and I cannot believe how badly Rian Johnson and Disney botched this movie. There isn't a single moment in this movie that feels organic or believable. It all feels staged and forced. \\n\\nThis whole movie reminds me of the god-awful voice overs that were added to the theatrical release of Blade Runner. It's always holding up a sign telling you how you're supposed to feel\\, how you're supposed to react. It doesn't believe you are capable of figuring out these things for yourself.\\n\\nI am someone who highly values immersion in all forms of storytelling. There wasn't a single moment in this movie where I felt immersed in it. For any movie that's a critical failing. For a Star Wars movie\\, that's unforgivable.\\n\\nI haven't even gotten into how long\\, plodding\\, and slow this movie is. It drags on and on with very little payoff. In the whole thing there's maybe ten minutes that are actually enjoyable.\\n\\nHopefully\\, JJ Abrams can get Star Wars back on track for Episode Nine\\, because Episode Eight was an unmitigated disaster.","true":true}
