Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all the fan boys....screaming Disney are destroying my star wars. Until a few days ago I would have considered myself a fanboy. Now I feel I am something apart. I am a fan. I loved the movie. It is not the same old star wars no. It is a new story. One worthy of our appreciation it is not a re-tread of what has gone before....if that is all you want then rewatch the original trilogy.....or the prequels if you enjoy them. Love what you love.\\n\\nThe movie is a bold tour de force in story telling and visually stunning. And a welcome addition to the star wars franchise. Go see this movie and judge for yourself with open eyes.forgetting all that has gone before.\\n\\nWell done to all involved.","true":true}
