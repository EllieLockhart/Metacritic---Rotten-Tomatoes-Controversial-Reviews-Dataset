Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes the prequels look great. Rian Johnson has said in multiple interviews that his plan was to subvert the viewers expectations. Give them something they\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)d never seen before. Here\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s the issue\\, subversion for the sake of it doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t work well. There has to be a long term reason for why you chose to take the film in a certain direction. And not only that\\, you have to take into account past events in the story. Rian just seems to want to give a middle finger to past events and move on with something that Star Wars fans didn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t want to see. The reason these movies do so well is because the fans love them. To not consider the fans at all and the journey theyve had with these movies is insane. I hope JJ can clean it up a bit but good luck. I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)m not very hopeful for the next few movies in the main series.","true":true}
