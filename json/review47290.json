Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible movie. It gets 1 star for visual effects\\, but the rest of the movie is an abomination and destroys every important thing about the Star Wars universe. The prequels gave us Jar-Jar and Midichlorians...but we had great characters added to the the universe as well. The Force Awakens was pan by many\\, but it did open up the opportunity to explore so many aspects of the Force and the SW universe. But Disney took this amazing Universe and crapped all over it and its fans. The Last Jedi is an abomination of a movie. Disney sucks the life out of everything it touches.","true":true}
