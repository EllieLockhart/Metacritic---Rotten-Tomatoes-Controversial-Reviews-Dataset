Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film\\, 2 and a half hours of non pay offs and the destruction of a much loved character\\, I will not go to see the next film. I am a woman and the women where some of the worst characters I have seen onscreen! as a woman why did the Kylo top off scene exist?? and if its equality these new Star Wars films are pushing why didn't Ray have her top off too?\\n\\nWorst Star Wars film.","true":true}
