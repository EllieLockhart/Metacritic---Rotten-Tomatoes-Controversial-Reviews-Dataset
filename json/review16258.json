Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to repeat what's been said thousands of times by persons that have written much better reviews.  My story is the same as many.  I've grew up on the original Star Wars.  I really wanted to like this movie but it's just terrible.  This will be the first star wars movie for which I won't purchase a home copy.  Between the terrible writing\\, killing off my favorite characters\\, and subjecting themselves to an SJW agenda\\, I can't support Star Wars anymore.  Very sad day for me.","true":true}
