Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I think the script went away from some obvious things..bombs dropping in space?? Leila suddenly utilizes the force we have never seen?? But I love that we have a story in a movie that continues and isn\u2019t just a bad sequel and can\u2019t make it past a3rd movie. ","true":true}
