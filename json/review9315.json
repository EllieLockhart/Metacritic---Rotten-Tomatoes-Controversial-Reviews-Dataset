Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gave it one star to get my review posted. Doesn't deserve it!  I'm pissed that Disney is trying to ruin a classic series! You made Yoda look like an idiot! You ruined Luke Skywalkers character!  I'm all about girl power but this was over the top! I'm sorry I paid money to see it and I won't be seeing the next installment!  Best to forget what I saw in TLJ and pretend it didn't happen!","true":true}
