Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. The story is fresh and powerful\\, and different plot lines are woven effortlessly together to create an epic. \\nEvery character is deep and interesting\\, with even minor characters having enough detail to hint at a story behind the action on screen\\, making the universe feel fully fleshed and real without too much exposition distracting from the main story. The visuals are positively stunning\\, with breathtaking panoramas and incredible\\, new locations - some of which hearken back to things we've seen in the original trilogy\\, some of which are brand new\\, capturing the imagination. Cameos from loved characters are treated with respect and flow effortlessly into the story. There is peril\\, there's action\\, there's love\\, there's loss; but ultimately\\, a focus on failure and growth makes the story beautifully human. \\n\\nThis movie is truly a work of art. I could gush about it forever\\, but instead I think I'll leave this review here and go out to watch the show again!","true":true}
