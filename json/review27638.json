Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pacing issues\\, writing\\, bad jokes\\, and direction of characters doomed this movie.  Despite stunning visuals at times\\, I can't say that I could recommend it ever to anyone. I have been a Star Wars fan since 1983 (6 years old).  No Star Wars would be better than the direction this film and The Force Awakens has taken the franchise.","true":true}
