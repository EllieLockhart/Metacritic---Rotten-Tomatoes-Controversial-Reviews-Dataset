Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers included)\\n\\nIt was...bad. It was a bad film\\, and it was an exceptionally bad Star Wars film.\\n\\nWhich isn't to say there weren't some GENUINELY good moments. The scene with Snoke's Star Destroyer and Holodo's Cruiser? Awesome. The subpar slapstick humor and plot holes? No.\\n\\nWhat is the WORST offense Johnson made? It doesn't FEEL like a Star Wars film\\, and that's the most damning thing possible.","true":true}
