Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written script.  More woman and minorities a good thing\\, except they were all made to look bad and incompetent.\\n\\nAlso the Princess Leia Mary Poppins moment was the worst.  New powers in the force\\, but with no forshadow!!!\\n\\nSnoke was a joke\\, the story was never explained well\\, the casino was a 45 min side trip for no reason except to rescue rats and leave children in slavery.\\n\\nAs a life long star Wars fan I am so disappointed with the mega rich companies destroying everything good.  I usually see Star Wars movies 2 or 3 time in the holidays bringing my whole family.   But once is enough for this garbage.","true":true}
