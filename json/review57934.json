Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did I just watch? Cause it wasnt what I thought it would be at all. I have been an avid star wars fan for a long time with novels from the old canon and many from the new\\, along with video games and keeping up with the animated series of clone wars and rebels. I went in with understanding its not the original trilogy but i in no way was prepared for how horrible this film turned out. Where force awakens was a new hope clone but created an interesting storyline with potential\\, this film buries it in bantha dodo and basically says fuck everything we have built. Disney has been very perticular about building the star wars universe carefully and testing the waters but this just proves again we have cookie cutter actors  and directors pretending they know star wars. You have failed me for the last time. I believed in you... Mark hamill was clearly right in saying they went in the wrong direction..","true":true}
