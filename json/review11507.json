Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie! Totally destoryed the Star Wars myth. A disrespect to huge characters like Luke and Leia not to mention the fans. This movie marks the end of Star Wars as we know it and we love it and the raise of Disney Wars. Movie is floded with poor humour\\, plot holes and very awful politics. No answers to questions raised in TFA. Not interested in this franchise anymore. Only good thing the CGI.","true":true}
