Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe it was the nostalgia but I could not deny this film was wonderful. The only mark missed was literally Mark\\, as in Mark Hammill. His performance was sub par and I felt threw off the cast as the others were strong actors. Beautiful and powerful scenes w Leia that made me cry tenfold and an absolutely heart wrenching score by John williams yet again. \\n\\nIf you love Star Wars this will feed your soul!","true":true}
