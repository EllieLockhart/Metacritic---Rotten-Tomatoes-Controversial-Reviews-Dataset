Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First of all I dont think it deserve a 0 to 5 review. I enjoyed the gameplay\/combat\\, and if you enjoyed the first game gameplay then you'll be happy with the slight improvements to this game. Maybe we expected to much? In the end this is the game we got and I think it's fine..... let's talk about the story\\, I think is kind of a mess. Unfortunately  the story just doesn't  hold up.

Maybe we expected to much? In the end this is the game we got and I think it's fine..... let's talk about the story\\, I think is kind of a mess. Unfortunately  the story just doesn't  hold up. The storytelling was just all over the place and so many plot holes\\, how did they know where joel was or how he looked like? Ok maybe they just got lucky and found him\\, but still too much to absorb I guess. I found this story to be really depressing and if you had lost a love one or whatever I recommend  to wait for a while\\, because this game really dwells in depression and later PTSD  and about dealing with loss and grief. Well to me it does. Yeah I can't deny that I found the story to be a little disappointing  on ellie's part and who we have to play through half of the game. Yeah I would give it a 5 in storytelling  and about a 7 in gameplay\\, it's fine and if your curious about playing maybe wait til it goes on sale\\, but yeah that obviously didn't stop me.
