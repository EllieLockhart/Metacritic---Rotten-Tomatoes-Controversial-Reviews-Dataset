Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie disregards much of the already fleshed out lore of The Force\\, and what is and isnt able to be done by users. Seemingly random now to who is able to use it at convenience to the nonsensical twisting plots. You can really see Disney coming through with their newly purchased princess wishing upon a star to survive the vaccuum of space. Supreme Leader Snoke and Phasma die with zero explanation as to who or where they came from which is extremely dissapointing considering both characters were given to extremely talented actors. Not to mention the huge problem in terms of storytelling\\, you felt no weight to them dying at all. I can see why Mark Hamill had to imagine a different back story for luke just to try and pull off the horrible dialogue and hermitage of Luke Skywalker. This movie was entertaining in theatres because of the action and beautiful CG. The days of Star Wars being a meaningful storyline with relatable characters and beautiful character development is over. Disney really through this into the furnace to pump out $$$$. I created a rotten tomato account just for this review as the critics were clearly bought out. I used to trust you rotten tomatoes!","true":true}
