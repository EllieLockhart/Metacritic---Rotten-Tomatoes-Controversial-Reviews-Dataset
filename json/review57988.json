Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"where to begin....... First let me state I am one of the biggest Star wars fan alive. Been following these movies for 40yrs and seen em hundreds of times. This movie let me down in more ways than I can count. Where the force awakings was basically a new hope retread\\, I don't know what the hell this is! From not truly disclosing Rey's parentage\\, or poorly disclosing it\\, to Leia's weird superman force BS\\, to kylo's supposedly best ever conflicted villain BS\\, when all he ever does is throw temper tantrums and whine\\, to the son of Vader\\, supposedly baddest Jedi ever\\, Luke Skywalker not even showing up in the flesh for his epic battle\\, then dying like an elderly patient in a nursing home\\, to killing off a great villain just like Darth Maul in episode one\\, and last but not least lame as light saber battles. Anyone remember Anakin and Obi wan in revenge of the Sith??? George Lucas selling to Disney was the worst decision for this franchise ever. Of course Rouge One was one of the best Star wars movies made. Why\\, because it was dark\\, gritty\\, and serious. the best space battle scene ever\\, and by far the best Vader scene to date. I will not be seeing this movie multiple times. ","true":true}
