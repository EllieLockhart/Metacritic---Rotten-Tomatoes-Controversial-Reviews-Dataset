Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi wasn't bad\\, it just has a LOT of stupid. The plot device of setting a space battle to look like a WW2 naval\/air battle could be great. If your going to do this\\, then adapt the physics and strategy to space. While yuour at it\\, figure out how anti gravity works. Lol\\n\\nCombine that with a missed place bond scene and you eat up half a movie. That being said their are some true Stars Wars moments that exceed what fans could have expected. Hopfuly Star Wars can figure out that they need to focus on a small band of rebels\\, not an army of extras.","true":true}
