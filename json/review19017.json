Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seemed like 75% of the movie was just filler with no real consequence to the ultimate outcome to the movie. Finn and Poe are regulated to non-essential characters\\, while the only redeeming scenes were with Luke and Ray. Kylo Ren is not the quintessential villain that Vader was\\, while Snoke is and always will remain a mystery. The Leia in space scene was mind-boggling ridiculous. This movie killed any anticipation for episode 9. I just don't care.","true":true}
