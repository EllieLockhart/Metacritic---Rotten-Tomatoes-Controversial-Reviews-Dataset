Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the best\\, if not the best\\, Star Wars films to date. As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, The Last Jedi reminds me much of Empire in its grandeur and its risk-taking. Rian Johnson directs a film that is daring and different\\, yet still distinctly Star Wars.\\n\\nExciting twists lead to intriguing questions that will have audiences\\, like me\\, theorizing and speculating until Episode 9 lands in 2019. Mark Hamil\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Carrie Fisher and Adam Driver all shine and deliver career-defining performances as Luke\\, Rey\\, Princess Leia and Kylo Ren. Kylo perhaps gets the most character development in The Last Jedi\\, much on the back of a broken Luke Skywalker\\, who is haunted by a moment of weakness and failure during his time as a Jedi master\\, and Rey's backstory is brought forth with new questions - are the revelations about Rey's past true? Or are they misdirection for both the character and the audience?\\n\\nVisually\\, The Last Jedi is spectacular. Beautiful framed full of exciting moments\\, including one moment that left the entire theater I was in with their jaws on the floor. Narratively\\, The Last Jedi stands above The Force Awakens in many ways. While the previous installment received criticism for being little more than a modern re-imagining of 1977's A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi takes some of the foundational elements of an Empire-like middle film and uses them in new ways. The Last Jedi is both familiar\\, feature similar elements to Empire and Return of the Jedi\\, but also entirely new.\\n\\nThat's not to say the film is without its flaws. Finn and Phasma continue to be promising characters that are entirely underutilized\\, and Finn's side-plot is entirely unnecessary and feels like an easy way to pad the runtime of an already long Star Wars film. Poe Dameron\\, one of the more promising characters in the new trilogy\\, gets more screen time in The Last Jedi but continues to be underutilized as well.\\n\\nIn the end\\, the ambition of The Last Jedi combined with excellent performances\\, a solid narrative and fantastic direction and visual effects more than overcome the shortcomings of the film and deliver what will go down as one of the best Star Wars films to date.","true":true}
