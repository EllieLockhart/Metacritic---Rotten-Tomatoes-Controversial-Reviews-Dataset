Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some fan reaction had the feel of a mob that has lost an election. Their version of Star Wars didn't get made\\, but was replaced by something that is however\\, largely consistent with 1977's original. That is\\, it's FULL of stuff -far-flung characters (both clean and dirty)\\, cheesy mumbo-jumbo\\, cutesy aliens\\, humour (both sly and cornball) dialogue\\, epic sweeping ambition\\, and tight battle scenes. This is the same series that brought you Ewoks\\, \\\"May the Force be with you\\\"\\, black and white characters (literally)\\, and spaceships that roared through the silence of space. It had a farm boy who falls in love with his sister for sakes...for a while anyway! But all that was forgiven because it was a romping good time. It was a mash-up of influences\\, cartoon characters and pulpy sci-fi plotlines...and that was the point. So now I ask\\, why so serious? Why so unforgiving? \\nThe irony comes\\, of course\\, because one wants to shake the heads of all those upitty\\, fun-loathing fans rife with disappointment\\, and shout\\, \\\"Get a life!\\\"","true":true}
