Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My first ever Movie Review is to defend this movie. It's a different pace then Previous Star wars but a great movie none the less. It's more human\\, Luke's whole plot line and his reaction is very human\\, and similar to Obiwans and Yoda. This movie goes unexpected places\\, give it a chance! ","true":true}
