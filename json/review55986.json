Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Safe. It did what TFA did; take elements from original movies\\, jumble them up and piece together a movie. Characters serve as plot devices for the soft reboot\\, only to be thrown away with ease\\, shattering the suspended disbelief. I cannot express how disappointed I am in this movie. Nothing new. No risks. Weird ass decisions that are tonally off by 180 degrees\\, and comedy that was out of place. The villain isn't a threat\\, nothing new is learned about anything substantial.","true":true}
