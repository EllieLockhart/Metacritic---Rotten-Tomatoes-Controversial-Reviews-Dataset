Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a massive marketing tease followed by zero payoff. In an effort to play it safe Disney neglected to create a cohesive storyline that could hook viewers for the inevitable sequel. I could go on about the many flaws of the film but I'm sure other fans have already done so adequately. I will state that I appreciated the diverse cast but loath how that cast was utilized. I get the feeling that Disney wants to blame the poor viewer reviews on bigotry\\, but no such malice is required to dislike this film.","true":true}
