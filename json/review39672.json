Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is absolutely the worst Star Wars movie EVER!!! I'm a big fan of SW and Disney and I liked what they have done up until this garbage was unleashed upon us. Not only did this movie trash everything that was set up in FA but it obliterated the SW universe and original characters all for \\\"subverting\\\" the audience and inserting personal agendas where it doesn't belong. I wish this movie didn't exist. I hope Disney is listening and will do a major course correction in IX. Help us JJ Abrams you're our only hope.","true":true}
