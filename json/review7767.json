Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent. I avoided all trailers and never had a Snoke-theory\\, so I think I'm in the minority of the SW fanbase. This was a thrilling ride. Visually spectacular. Well acted. Great story telling! Thanks Rian!!","true":true}
