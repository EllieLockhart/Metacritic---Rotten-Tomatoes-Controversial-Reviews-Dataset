Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[No spoilers]\\n\\nAside from a lazy plot and completely dumped on all the films that came before it in a way I'm not sure they can recover from. This is pretty much a franchise killing film\\, and that's really sad considering I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid. I really hope they ignore everything that happened in this film moving forward\\, but I doubt it. It seems like they laid the groundwork for something new\\, the problem is that something new isn't any good.","true":true}
