Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hot mess! Just a bunch of scenes like altogether to produce this garbage! Kathleen Kennedy destroys the original characters. Starting with Han and ending with Luke. This film had no soul or direction. Just crap!!! They took my childhood love for these characters and threw it into the garbage chute... :(","true":true}
