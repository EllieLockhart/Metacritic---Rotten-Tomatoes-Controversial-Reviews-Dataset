Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fun movie\\, but the worst possible Star Wars movie and the worst possible sequel to episode 7.\\nThey don't even have to make episode 9 anymore\\, Rian Johnson literally KILLED everything that could have amounted to something great.","true":true}
