Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion the newest star wars movie the last jedi was a great watch and\\, although some may disagree\\, helped the franchise a great deal. It brought in new and familiar faces and binded them together to create something truly special. I am a star wars fan and have been since a very young age and eventhogh i stay loyal to the first collection in the saga i believe that the newer movies have started something new for the best and i am excited to see what the future holds. I voted 5 stars on behalf of me and all the others in my viewing because we were ALL on the edge of our seats and laughing and crying and enjoying a movie which is really special and had us talking after. It was amazing to here all the younger children coming out smiling and telling there parents that the film title was wrong and they named it wrong since its NOT the last jedi. And it made me smile because it makes me hope that star wars will continue to thrive in the future generations. And afterall hope is the spark that lights the fire.. ? Heidi (13)","true":true}
