Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never took off....critics are wrong.  Rian blew the opportunity to answer lots of questions set up by The Force Awakens and didn't.  It's too bad\\, I had high hopes for this movie.","true":true}
