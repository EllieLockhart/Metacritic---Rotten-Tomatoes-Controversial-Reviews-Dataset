{"101487":169485,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"++++SPOILERS++++\\n\\nJust another Disney Star Wars movie\\, this time a bit better than Episode 7 as it is not entirely a copy-paste. Half of the movie has a complete new plot\\, and half other is just a remake of Episode 5 and 6. Despite what I'm going to comment\\, the film is good to have a good time on the cinema\\, nothing else.\\n\\n****\\n\\nWe have a new Hoth\\, a new Yoda-Luke training with almost same actions\\, we have the vision and thus making the star to go to the guy who needs redemption\\, we have a new Lando\\, we have a new Throne Room scene and a new destruction of a massive superweapon\/ship. And also\\, the new ewoks.\\n\\nAll these new remake of Ep.5 and 6 is not innovation\\, is just again the greedy cowardice of Disney to make something the old diehard fans should love\\, but at least in my circle\\, 90% didn't like it at all.\\n\\nThey promised us a far more dark plot than Rogue One\\, yet all the comedy and gags all around the film make it far worse than seeing Jar Jar Binks in Episode 1. The gesture of Luke getting out of the explosion dust is just out of place. And even if they wanted a lot the porgs to be on the movie they should've never let them in the Falcon so we could have half movie without them.\\n\\nSuper Leia? I mean\\, come on\\, we all do love Carrie Fisher and Leia\\, but that was too much. This\\, and all the Luke thingy made the Force turn from mystic to some kind of magic more linked to Harry Potter than Star Wars.\\n\\nSnoke? Ridiculous. The best Sith of all the saga (sorry\\, Legends fan here\\, that is not true\\, as we have Revan\\, Exar\\, Freedon\\, Nihilus\\, Valkorion..) gets killed so easily by a teenager like it was no effort. Sure Disney wanted us to believe that Kylo was far more greater than him\\, but making his death so easy makes the scene jus unbelievable\\n\\nYoda? I loved it\\, as a huge original-saga fan\\, I just love it a lot. But there was no need in that\\, if they made Luke what he was always supposed to be: an diehard hero\\, who never refuses the light\\, just like on EU Legends. But\\, well\\, that scene was just to empathize with us old fans.\\n\\nLuke? well\\, as said\\, I dislike completely what they made to him. I had my hopes that he was asking for knowledge. They made him turn into an \\\"unsensitive\\\" to the Force. That could've been great if his return to the light wasn't so easy. His death? Totally out of sense. He didn't even seem about to die like Yoda did before disappearing\\, nor he did die in combat like Ben. They\\, as said before\\, turned the Force to some kind of Magic out of context.\\n\\nRey? Come on\\, a bunch of lessons and he is as great as Kylo? I mean\\, I love how they managed her character on this film\\, with it was a mess on the Force and Lightsaber training. Even if she is to become a new Luke.\\n\\nKylo? Could anyone really think\\, in any universe far far away\\, a teenager as unstable as him could rule the First Order? Where are the Ysalamiri when needed?\\n\\nSoundtrack? Please don't blame it on John Williams\\, if the film doesn't  transmit the precise feelings\\, he impresses it on the music. He did a great job aside from the plot\\n\\nAnother Film of a triology that just imitates the design of the original triology. In sense of worlds\\, technology\\, plot... Just a reharsh of Rebels vs Empire","true":true}
