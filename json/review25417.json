Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nonstop progressive propaganda.\\nFrom blundering male characters to feminist hairstyles\\, vegan Chewbacca and saving the animals\\, smashing and looting the rich and off-putting colloquialisms. \\nTLJ messes up basic Star Wars lore\\, Yoda looks worse than any Yoda yet put on screen\\, the story is rambly and even absurd. Your favorite characters from TFA will take a second seat to the new cast of social justice warriors\\, and all your questions from the last movie will go unanswered as we open plot holes the size of buckets between sheets of plot armor.\\nAdam Driver's visceral and relatable portrayal of Kylo Ren was incredible\\, singlehandedly making this movie 25% watchable. The other 75% was the most disappointing cinema experience I have ever had in my life. I was so frustrated with the palpable agenda that I felt like crying\\, and the question \\\"what the f### is happening\\\" began to lose its meaning. \\nUnbearably disappointing.","true":true}
