Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A flawed\\, but overall great film that actually delivers a meaningful message to the viewer while actually being original.  The hatred for this film is completely unwarranted.  Just about every nitpick people like to point out against the film could also be applied to the original trilogy.","true":true}
