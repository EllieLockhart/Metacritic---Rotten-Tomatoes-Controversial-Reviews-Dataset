Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney destroys Star Wars. Luke is now a murder that kills children while they sleep. Rey's parents wind up being drunk trailer park trash that sell their daughter off for a Budwiser \\, and everyone in the galaxy has the Force within them. Oh did I mention that  Snoke is killed off by a cheap parlor trick. Disney and Director Rian Johnson have turned our beloved franchise into and extreme leftest political statement. NOT HAPPY. May Rian Johnson and the higher ups at Disney be strapped on to a bus make out of dynamite and may this bus be placed on a road to the sun. Thank you Mr Johnson and you Disney pricks for destroying our beloved Star Wars. May you burn in hell.","true":true}
