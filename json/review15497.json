Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it... my wife loved it... and most importantly\\, our 3rd and 5th grade boys loved it. 'Best Star Wars yet!' exclaimed my 10 year old son as the credits began to roll (and he's seen all the others many times each\\, of course)... and\\, when its all said and done\\, isn't it the opinion of the 8-12 year old demographic that should matter the most?","true":true}
