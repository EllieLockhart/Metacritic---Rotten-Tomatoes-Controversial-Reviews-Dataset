Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure where to start. This was just a horrible movie in general. Full of plot hole and really just destroyed the franchise. If I had known I would not have seen it. But I was trying to avoid spoilers. Wouldn't have mattered because there was no possible way you could spoil this bad of a movie. Star Wars has no where left to go. I'm completely done with the franchise and will not see another Disney Star Wars ever again.","true":true}
