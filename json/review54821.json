Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was fantastic. A new production crew has taken over the franchise and that shifts the tone a bit\\, but I think they earn it. Are there off moments? Sure! Lots. But they aren't overbearing. Most are forgivable winks and nudges. There are also plenty of moments that\\, as a long-time Star Wars fan\\, I wanted to see. But these aren't gratuitous\\, either. \\nThe strengths of the film are (1) it's gorgeous. The worlds are iconic and interesting\\, and the action flows very well. (2) Trying to avoid spoilers\\, I think the way it plays with viewer expectations is almost genius-honoring the expectations built up by the legacy yet subverting them in plausible ways. (3) Like a Star Wars movie should do (but often recently hasn't done)\\, it prompts thought on real world issues-particularly how we forge our identities and deal with failure. I'll put up with a few Muppets for that. In fact\\, heck with it. I kind of end up liking them\\, too.","true":true}
