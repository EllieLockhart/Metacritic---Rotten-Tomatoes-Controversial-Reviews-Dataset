Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't really know where to start. I haven't figured out all the reasons yet but I found this movie to be disappointing. It wasn't engaging I am trying to remember any scenes where I felt truly drawn into the movie\\, characters fell flat and nothing seemed to be taken seriously.  ***mild spoilers***Finn does a coward to hero with a cause arc once again. Po makes a treasonous mistake costing a lot of lives but is unmoved and unchanged. Basically every character sort of middles about making mistakes and then making jokes at innapropriate times often enough to dispel any sense of seriousness or danger. There is a nonscensical boring and at best deppressing spaceship chase where the rebels are supposedly faster yet somehow cant create distance. need a second viewing to unpack why this didn't hit home in more detail.","true":true}
