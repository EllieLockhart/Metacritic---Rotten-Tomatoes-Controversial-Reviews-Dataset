Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a bad movie even if you forget that its star wars and judge it on its own merits its still a bad movie. Dumb plot with characters doing stupid things that have no meaning and mostly turn out to be pointless. Its overtly feminist with all the women treating men like trash or acting like they are stupid. There is no threat or point to anything that happens.","true":true}
