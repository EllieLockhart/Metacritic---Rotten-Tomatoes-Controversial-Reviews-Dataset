Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan so I am grateful for the movie regardless of quality.  I was disappointed as it seems like the storyline and the scenes wear rehashed version of scenes in previous movies.  How many times must we see the Millennium Falcon chased in to tight quarters where only amazing flying gets them out and all that follow them hit things or blow trying to follow the MF.  I mean this fan base is literally fanatic.  Do they thing the base d that buys all the marketing and sleeps out for the tickets and sees the films double digit times\\, would not recognize the rehashed themes and plot line?  Lets give you the benefit of the doubt and say all of that was on purpose\\, then your execution was even worse.  IF you want to make a reference to something we know\\, make it harder to see.  Make it so we cannot predict what will happen.  The storyline was predictable because it was so obviously rehashed.  Do not insult your base.  Do better and be better.  I am glad I saw it because I am a fan but it ws by far the worst  SW yet.","true":true}
