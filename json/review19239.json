Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a complete rehash of everything. It is a nice departure from the original trilogy but is still a rhyme. While there are a few things that I would've done differently\\, I loved it! It's getting way too much negative response simply because a lot of choices were unexpected by superfans.","true":true}
