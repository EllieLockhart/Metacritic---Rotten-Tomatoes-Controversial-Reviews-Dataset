Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie checked all the \\\"Star Wars' boxes for me and was quite enjoyable. They made some tough choices regarding characters but I think they made a good decision as it kind of frees up the franchise to more options in the future.","true":true}
