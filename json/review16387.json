Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really confused about the hate this film is receiving from the fans. Was it the best Star Wars movie? No\\, but it was really entertaining. Had a lot of surprises that were enjoyable. Personally\\, I can't wait to go back and see it again. ","true":true}
