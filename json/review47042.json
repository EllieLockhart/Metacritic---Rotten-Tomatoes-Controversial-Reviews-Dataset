Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible disappointment for a dechar diehard Star wars fan. It was almost like they told Rian Johnson\\, \\\"You have one day to write rite a Star wars movie-go.\\\" No real plot\\, no questions answered and just didn't belong in the star wars world. #Ihateyourian","true":true}
