Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly besides going against all of luke's character traits the movie is good. In my opinion e8 has one of the most visually appealing fights in the franchise. The movie is a bit too long. There are certain times when theres really nothing happening for like 10 minutes but the last 30 minutes of the movie are filled with hardcore goosebumps.\\nI dont think they should have made rey as strong as she is. Luke felt insane powers from kylo and rey while training them \\nBut kylo was actually trained \\nReally kind of an ass pull for rey to be able to win but i guess this is episode 7's fault.\\n\\nLooking at my review i can honestly say the movie has it flaws for sure\\nBut god damn did those last 30 minutes and especially the final scene get me hyped up.","true":true}
