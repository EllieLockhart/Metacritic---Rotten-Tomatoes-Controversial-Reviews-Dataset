Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually the movie had many points that I enjoyed. The lightsaber battle with Rey and Ran was one of my favorite parts. However after that it all goes downhill\\, so many plot holes in this movie if it were a ship it would be the Titanic. I really was left disappointed at the end of this one and I went into it really hopeful. Rogue One was an awesome movie and I had hoped this one would top the previous.","true":true}
