Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many bad choices made\\, so many plot holes and terrible dialogue. Some great visuals and effects\\, but that does not make a good movie. The story and character arcs were appealing\\, and Luke Skywalker's treatment was a criminal waste of good opportunity. Very disappointed.","true":true}
