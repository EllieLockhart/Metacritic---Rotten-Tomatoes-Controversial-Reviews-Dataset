Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a robot\\, just a disappointed fan that created this account to say this movie was as bad as the true fans say.\\n\\nI grew up watching and loving these characters.  I saw the battles between good and evil and between hope and despair.  I take my Star Wars very seriously and I cannot understand how this movie was even made.\\n\\nWe saw the pitiful treatment of our old heroes.  We saw the introduction of some new (and boring\/annoying) new characters.  We saw a movie go absolutely no where.  It was really that bad.","true":true}
