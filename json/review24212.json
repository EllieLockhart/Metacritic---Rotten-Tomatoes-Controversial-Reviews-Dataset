Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mehhh. It was ok. Action was awesome. Sad that it didn\u2019t rhyme with the others. Frustrating plot holes with an underwhelming story that is followed by wasted opportunities for important character development. Hopefully JJ brings it back and makes sense of this mess in the Next Installment. ","true":true}
