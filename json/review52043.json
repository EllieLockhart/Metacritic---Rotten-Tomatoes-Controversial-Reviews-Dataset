Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After loving TFA\\, this one killed not only the trilogy\\, but my interest in the series in general.  First viewing I disliked\\, but the second time made me realize how horrendous the twists actually are.  New fans may enjoy this one\\, but anyone who had any investment in the long term plot of the saga essentially had their entire history deficated on for weak gags and a random writer\/director to get kids to think he's smart.  I honestly don't see how the next movie could recover from this.  Back to the games\/cartoons for good SW stuff now.","true":true}
