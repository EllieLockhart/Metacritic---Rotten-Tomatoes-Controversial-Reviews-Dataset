Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lot of people hating on the movie because they didn't agree with a couple decisions from the story.  I binge-watched Episodes 1\\,2\\,3\\, and 7 prior to seeing the Last Jedi in theater.  None of the arguments that I have seen (aside from some pacing issues) seem to stem from the movie itself\\, but rather the expectations that people had for the story or people who didn't understand the structure of the movie.  This isn't to say that they 'should have enjoyed' the movie\\, when obviously they didn't\\, as their opinions are as valid as my own.  Just pointing it out as it seems to me that they felt very\\, very strongly about only a couple of things within the movie\\, and so a less die-hard fan (of I don't even know which Star Wars movies they would be die-hard fans of since their takeaway was so different than my own) is much more likely to enjoy the movie.","true":true}
