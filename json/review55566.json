Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bad movie\\, by any means. It is thoroughly entertaining for the most part. There were a few flaws\\, mainly having to do with characters who are under-utilized\\, however I don't understand everyone's beef with the new force powers that were displayed. The fact of the matter is the critics didn't do this film any favors by hyping the living hell out of it. To all fans of Star Wars\\, I promise you: You will NEVER get another Empire Strikes Back\\, so stop expecting one. If you are\\, stop watching the new ones because of down that road you go\\, only pain will  you find. The shame about people's reception to this movie is that is that Rian Johnson really gave an honest effort to make something different here... and succeeded\\, at least in my opinion. Yet the same people who criticized The Force Awakens for being too similar to A New Hope have now turned on Johnson for daring to tread new ground. Kind of a shame\\, really.","true":true}
