Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is one of the best in the series. It doesn't hold you hand and follow along with fan theories and typical tropes. Like any film it does have issues but nothing that strip it of  being a phenomenal piece of cinema. It's bold\\, fun\\, shocking and exciting\\, and will cause you to reflect on the series as a whole.","true":true}
