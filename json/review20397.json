Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand that they needed to move past Luke\\, but the way they interpret Luke goes against everything his character fought for and became in the original trilogy. If not for that if have given this movie 4 stars. Disney knows we are going to watch the third film regardless\\, after all we watched two already\\, so I don't think they care much for our criticism. ","true":true}
