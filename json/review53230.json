Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring plot of slow speed space chase\\, very minimal world building except for a side plot that turns out to not matter much to the main plot\\, and one dimensional new characters and the destruction of old characters. Over all\\, I left the theater feeling as my time had been wasted. It had some high points though\\, it was a visually beautiful movie\\, that was about it. If this was all\\, I would have probably given this movie a 2\\, maybe 2.5; however\\, Lucasfilm employees' complete dismissal and mistreatment of critical customers has been absolutely disgraceful\\, often resorting to some of the worst character attacks: racists\\, sexists\\, misogynists\\, Nazis\\, white supremacists\\, etc. I can not support this behavior and as far as I am concerned\\, Lucasfilm has lost a customer in me\\, this from someone who has spent thousands of dollars on Lucasfilm's merchandise over the past few decades. Congrats to Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for creating a film that hacked the most profitable intellectual property in human history to bits.","true":true}
