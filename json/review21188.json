Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was waiting a really long time for this movie. Also\\, it was first Star Wars movie I had an opportunity to watch in United States. The way they treated my favourite character was a great disappointment to me and franckly\\, I wish it was possible to unsee this movie.","true":true}
