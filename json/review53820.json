Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated it. Without a doubt one of the most disappointing experiences. First\\, the amount of cheap humour forced into this film has shaken how much I trust Disney with the Star Wars saga. It's a space opera\\, not a comedy. If they're trying to make us laugh at every turn to win us over\\, it's doing the exact opposite. Though I could list them all\\, special attention need be directed to Rey telling Kylo to \\\"put a shirt on.\\\" At that point I knew this movie was beyond repair. That does not belong in Star Wars\\, at all. Second\\, Leia turning into Space Mary Poppins was undoubtedly one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. It was all of macabre\\, silly and a joke at once. Snoke's death was completely underwhelming and negates the grandiosity built up in the previous instalment. The Canto Bight sequence was so out of place it had me questioning whether I was watching Star Wars or James Bond - from beginning to end it never should have appeared in a Star Wars film. The Force Awakens' cliffhanger ending had fans hoping for so much more than the disappointment of Luke throwing his lightsaber behind him and walking off. His entire character was mistreated. Though the 'Kylo and Rey vs Snoke's guards' scene was brilliantly done and is one of the few good things about this movie\\, Star Wars wouldn't be what it is without lightsaber duels and this film goes rogue by being the first to not feature one. Would've been very powerful if Rey and Luke had fought with their sabers on Ahch-To instead of with sticks. Again\\, disappointing. The introduction of Porgs seems to serve no purpose but to give Disney something to sell as toys. If Star Wars has become just business\\, we're living in a sad time. It may be nit-picking\\, but smaller things like the lightsabers not being loud enough and sounding\/looking different to what we're used to also leads to a lesser experience. On a lighter note\\, the appearance of Yoda's ghost was fantastic (even if the puppet looked very strange at first) and I'll admit to becoming a little teary. Credit to Adam Driver for a quality performance\\, definitely one of the better things about this new sequel saga. Ridley's performance wasn't as solid as it was in TFA and Rey is still the biggest Mary Sue. The cinematography of the film was incredible and some of the shots were simply beautiful\\, but it is let down by it's long length\\, boring story\\, forced cheap humour\\, disappointing answers\\, and generally poor choices. Majority of Star Wars fans are completely disappointed and let down by this underwhelming instalment and I think I'd much rather pretend that Legends is still canon at this point.","true":true}
