Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see why Mark Hamill protested against what they did with Luke Skywalker. Kylie Ren was the only believable or enjoyable character in this said mess. This is the end of Star Wars at least as far as the Skywalker saga is concerned. It deserved much better.Hopefully people will begin to wake up to the fact that a giant monopoly like Disney will only continue to water down any franchise it gets its grubby white mitts on.","true":true}
