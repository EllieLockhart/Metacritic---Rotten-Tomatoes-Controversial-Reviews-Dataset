Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, the good stuff first.\\nThe visuals\\, special effects and sound are stunning. If this were a Michael Bay movie\\, it would be perfect (well aside from the pacing).\\n\\nWarning\\, spoilers ahead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the bad stuff - and oh boy\\, is there a _lot_ of that.\\n\\nThis movie is one gigantic plot-hole\/plot device.\\nFrom the conveniently places criminal\/super-hacker on the casino-plant\\, who sells out Finn and Rose to the FO (btw\\, how could that guy _know_ about the transports\\, when even Finn and Rose didn't know about it?)\\, over the FO refusing to launch their complement of probably 1000 Tie fighters to intercept the approaching Resistance fighters in the opening scenes and their refusal to use those same fighters to attack the fleeing Resistance fleet to the fact that admiral blue-hair only stayed behind to fly the cruiser into the FO flagship\\, even though no-one could know that would be needed (the stated reason was \\\"someone has to fly the ship or they will notice we left it\\\" but 1. the ship is flying in a straight line anyway (perhaps put some duct-tape on the throttle or something) and 2. she doesn't fly it anyway\\, just looks out the window\\, watching the departing transports) How come the FO doesn't notice those transports\\, btw\\, I didn't realise the Resistance had borrowed a few Romulan cloaking devices.\\n\\nThen there is the light-speed ramming itself. Ok\\, so ships can now ram other ships at light-speed and kill much larger ships that way. Ok\\, why does anyone build capital ships? For that matter\\, why didn't the Rebels kill the Death Star that way? Why doesn't everyone just build robot-piloted drones\\, smashing into anything that needs being taken out? I guess the script called for another stunning visual and that was the best they could come up with (and yes\\, it _does_ look stunning - still doesn't make the slightest sense)\\n\\n\\nNext we have the characters.\\n\\nThe whole FO is made up of complete incompetents. It's like the crew of Spaceball One and I'm not s**ting you.\\nThere are only two member in the whole FO we see in this movie\\, who are not completely incompetent. The captain of the dreadnought in the opening scene who complains that the fighters haven't been launched already and Captain Phasma.\\n\\nRey is the _definition_ of a Mary Sue. She already knows everything she will ever need to know (Yoda's own words). There is no room whatsoever for character development.\\n\\nLeia is apparently able to doe feats with the force none of the old jedi-master was capable of (breath and fly in the vacuum of space)\\n\\nSnoke\\, who was build up to be that great villain is killed off just like that\\n\\nKylo\\, who replaces Snoke as the Supreme Leader is still this emo-boy and _completely_ unbelievable as the big\\, bad opponent.\\n\\nAdmiral blue-hair is the words military leader the Rebels\\, I mean the Resistance has ever seen\\, tanking her troop's morale low enough that Poe can instigate a mutiny.\\n\\nRose is a selfish\\, egocentric b**ch who is willing to sacrifice the _entire_ Resistance\\, so she can save Finn from sacrificing himself and can be credited with two of the worst lines in cinematic history\\n1. \\\"Now it was worth it\\\" when they free those dog-horses on the casino planet\\, after their plan to save the Resistance fails (hint: no it isn't you nitwit\\, by failing you have just killed all your friends)\\n2. \\\"Don't fight what you hate\\, save what you love\\\" when she stops Finn from sacrificing himself in order to save the Resistance (hint: That's what he was just trying to do\\, you imbezil).\\n\\nThere are a few characters I can live with.\\nI actually don't have _that_ much of a problem with Luke. People can change over a few decades (doesn't mean I _like_ it\\, though) Finn becomes _kinda_ likeable at the end when he finally decides to do something heroic and Phasma comes over as a strong woman (of course\\, she is killed off after some 2 minutes of screen time).\\n\\n\\nThen there is the agenda.\\nSome say there is no feminist\/SJW agenda to that movie. I think those should have their eyes examined.\\nThe bad guys are made up _exclusively_ of cis-white males (except for Phasma\\, who is killed off at once)\\nWomen are wise\\, all-knowing\\, infallible beings who only smile at the stupidity of the men.\\n\\nProblem with this is\\, the women in TLJ don't come _across_ as strong women. They are pathetic.\\nRose is a self-centered b**ch\\, Admiral blue-hair is incompetent as hell\\, Leia is most of the time unconsious and Rey isn't strong\\, she is god. Being strong isn't being good at everything\\, being strong means trying again and again\\, despite your shortcomings\\, working to improve yourself\\, overcome your deficits and finally\\, in the end\\, to succeed. There are no _struggles_ for Rey\\, she is just perfect. Strong my a**\\n\\nFinally\\, the pacing:\\nOH. MY. GOD\\nThere is a chase scene - well\\, it is more like a scenario - of the FO fleet chasing the Resistance fleet - very\\, very slowly. It's like watching a turtle race.\\nThen there is the whole \\\"Casino Planet Side Quest\\\"\\, which takes about half an hour and leads to absolutely nothing.\\n\\nThe list could go on but I'll stop now as this is already way longer than I intended.\\n\\nBottom line. If all you want is eye-candy and don't mind having feminist ideology rammed down your throat\\, go watch it.\\nEveryone else\\, avoid at all cost.","true":true}
