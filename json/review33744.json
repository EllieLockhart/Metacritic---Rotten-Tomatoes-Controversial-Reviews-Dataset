Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie pandering to the lowest common denominator. Forced SJW nonsense\\, cutesy disney bull with those ridiculous porgs that might as well have stamped on their forehead \\\"aren't I cute aren't I so cute please buy all the merchandise for me moms and dads for your kids cause aren't I so cute aren't I so cute\\\" Jesus.. I can't stand movies like this.","true":true}
