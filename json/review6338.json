Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney must be saving a lot of money on writers by just recycling\/shuffling plot devices from the original Star Wars series and letting 5th graders fill in the dialogue. The humor was forced and juvenile\\, plot-line made no sense\\, poorly edited\\, missed about every mark (aside from Rey) on character development. The Force Awakens was at least fun nostalgia binge and introduced some fun new characters. The Last Jedi missed the mark in every category. I have no idea\\, aside from Disney bots and young children\\, who would give this film a good review. Such a missed opportunity. ","true":true}
