Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie takes a big Dump on the old Films. So much diesrepect to Star Wars fans all around the world. The way they treated Luke Skywalker who is one of the most importent Heros in Film History is insane! They should make a new edit and re shoot many szenes. Plus make the film shorter. Then maybe they will be able to get me to keep watching the up coming films and buying the merch. I have never felt so much hate a film before like this. Lets not let them get away with this!!!!!!!!","true":true}
