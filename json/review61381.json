The two largest twists of the story were completely anticlimactic and a big middle finger to the fans of the first game. You aren't likely to get attached to any of the characters in the new game\\, which is really shocking for a Naughty Dog title. It's also extremely clear that Naughty Dog had a political agenda when creating this game. Let me be clear\\, it's not the agenda that makes the story a 0\/10. It's the agenda coupled with a complete disregard for what the fan base deems as beloved characters as well as a completely inconsistent story with very little depth. Unfortunate\\, considering the studios last 5 new gen games had some of the best storytelling in video game history.\r\rGameplay didn't see much of an improvement over the first game\\, but it didn't need to improve here. Graphics on the other hand are leaps and bounds greater than the previous game and I didn't even think that was really possible after the first game was remastered for PS4.\r\rSadly the story is the most important part of any game like this. And the first game was so well done that it was hard for any game to live up to the high bar it set. Unfortunately\\, this not only didn't reach the bar the first game set\\, this set that bar on fire as if it never existed.\r\rThe first title should've never received a sequel with the same characters if it was to be done so poorly. To me\\, Last of Us is the only game in this \\\"franchise\\\".\r\rGraphically and gameplay-wise\\, I have a hard time giving this less than a 7\\, but because the story is so poorly done\\, so poorly thrown together and is such an integral part of the franchise that this game is a 5 for fans\\, a 7 for newcomers. A 6 is fair. This is the Haze of the PS4.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
