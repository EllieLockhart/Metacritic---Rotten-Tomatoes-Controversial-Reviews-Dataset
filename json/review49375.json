Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars story ever\\, the writers suck\\, but the filming quality of the scenes were awesome but not good enough to save the Star Wars Universe\\, it has been destroyed due to this film a complete disrespect to the lore and character development created in all the past films\\, wtf went wrong! 30+ years of being a fan (39 y.o. currently). The kid inside mourned.","true":true}
