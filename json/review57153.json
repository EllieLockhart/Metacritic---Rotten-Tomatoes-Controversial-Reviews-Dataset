Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is now my least favorite Star Wars Movie.  \\n\\nThe dialogue has some humorous moments\\, but is otherwise forgettable.\\nStar Wars may have always been political\\, but the push in this one is just too in your face and ridiculous.\\nThe Story?  Forgettable\\, boring\\, disjointed\\, and very poorly written.  \\n\\nThis movie feels rushed with unnecessary side stories and a plot twist that was unnecessary and cheapens what could have been my favorite Star Wars moment ever.  \\n\\nI cannot suggest seeing this movie and I fear for any more Star Wars movies if this is a sign of things to come.","true":true}
