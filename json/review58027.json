Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this was not a bad movie\\, it was a deeply disappointing movie.  The Last Jedi was supposed to be part of a story arc that began with A New Hope\\, but it tries to be something independent.  The Force Awakens\\, despite it's flaws\\, did a pretty good job of trying to continue the story despite the thirty year gap in time from Return of the Jedi\\, and it set up some really interesting story points for The Last Jedi.  However\\, no attempt was made to follow through on the story line and character development of prior movies; instead\\, this movie tries to break away and be it's own thing.  This worked fine with Rogue One\\, because it was something that fell outside of the scope of this story\\, even though it was connected to it.  The original trilogy\\, the prequels\\, and the current trilogy were always intended to be one complete story broken into episodes.  The Force Awakens tried to stay within those bounds\\, but The Last Jedi makes no attempt to do so.  For this reason it does not work as an Episode VIII\\, and is a huge let down for anyone who was expecting it to follow through on what was set up in Episode VII.  It gets two and a half stars because\\, as I said above\\, it is not a bad movie in itself; but it only gets two and a half because it fails dismally to live up to the potential that it had following The Force Awakens\\, and I'm left wishing that we could just scrap this and re-do it.","true":true}
