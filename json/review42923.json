Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so terrible. I am actually surprised it has 50% fan approval rating. The story was slow and boring. The plot holes were everywhere and forced\\, and the cringe worthy humor just made things worse. Rose\/Finn side plot was a boring waste of screen time and poor Luke. Rian Johnson must hate Luke and all things Skywalker. Next on the Disney list is\\, Solo: A Star Wars Story. Man I hope Chewie is awesome in that movie and still an omnivore.","true":true}
