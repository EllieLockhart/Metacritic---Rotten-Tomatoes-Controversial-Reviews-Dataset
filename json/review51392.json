Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute trash. I understand people want new with this series\\, but Disney not only goes overboard trying to appease everyone they steal from all the pass movies. From Rays visions causing her to leave her training like Luke in V\\, to return of the Jedi with Luke disappearing like Yoda. The fight scenes are utter crap\\, with Disney taking a Marvel approach while abandoning all that is known in the Star Wars universe. As an avid fan and viewer\\, I must say that I will not be watching the next episode on the premier day and Disney has crushed my love for this franchise's future.","true":true}
