Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers) Terrible movie. What a waste of one of the best sci fi heros of all time. Luke\\, a Jedi freaking master\\, just sits around pouting the whole movie then promptly dies when using the force. Also Finn\u2019s only relevance to the plot is being Rey\u2019s love interest\\, so adding in Rose to pair with Finn was a terrible decision and a waste of half the movie. Kylo Ren is easily the most boring villain in the whole Saga. At least Snoke was somewhat interesting\\, but they killed him off before we learned anything interesting about him. ","true":true}
