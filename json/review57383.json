Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should have been titled \\\"Star Wars: The Beginning of the End\\\". I have been quite disappointed.\\n\\nThe humour in one of the first scenes fails in being funny and just shows how ridiculous this franchise is becoming. Disney is turning Star Wars into a joke and money machine\\, using the Marvel recipe. A recipe that doesn't work and that mainly consists of overusing Special FX to cover the lack of depth in the story\\, overuse of stupid jokes\/humour\\, and a shot of a shirtless guy (to give teenagers something to w**k on?).\\n\\nAborted plots and vilains (to develop and sell comics and novels maybe?) and new cute creatures (probably to sell toys).\\n\\nAt this rate\\, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Guardians of the Galaxy showing up in Episode IX...\\n\\nLoved Carrie Fisher's performance. Very emotional\\, especially since a lot of lines take a double meaning after her death.","true":true}
