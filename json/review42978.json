Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. I was 10 years old when the first Star Wars came out. I have liked most of them... some less some more. Return of the Jedi was terrible. Very disappointed...","true":true}
