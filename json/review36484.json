Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie\\, although cinematically beautiful\\, has a lot of plot holes. The storyline is quite lack luster and seems unnecessary in the franchise\\, a lot more could have been fit into this movie than was. Overall it was quite the disappointment.","true":true}
