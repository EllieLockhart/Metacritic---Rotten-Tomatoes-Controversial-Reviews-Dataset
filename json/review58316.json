Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, this movie was just really\\, really disappointing!  Way too much comic relief (sometimes seemed more like Guardians of the Galaxy)\\, non-sensical sequences\\, \\\"Force\\\" powers that border on ridiculous - or at least inconsistent with previous examples.  Also seemed very political - rich vs poor\\, animal rights\\, weapons suppliers fanning the flames of war\\, role of women in leadership\\, etc. which is all well and good - but that is not what Star Wars has been so much about in the past\\, in my opinion\\, and it just ruins a good movie.  And many fans seem to have spent more time concocting reasonable character connects than this director (Rian Johnson?).  Went to the opening night showing - no one clapped or cheered at the end as is typical for midnight showing!  We represented the faithful Star Wars fan base and I think everyone was just in shock about how bad this movie was...and it could have been so great!!  Frustrated and disappointed.","true":true}
