We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I know this is my first review on Metacritic but I have several others on my steam profile. Im writing this as a warning to players who really liked the first game. First of all\\, this game is polarizing\\, it doesn't like to pull its punches when it tries to make you feel bad. I wouldn't have a problem with that if I was the one making the bad decisions but this game forces you to do ugly things and then tries to make you feel bad for those things.\rI'm not sure how much of the team is left that developed the first game but I do know the people in charge have definitely changed and it shows in the darker atmosphere and storytelling. A lot of my anticipation of this game came from their marketing which showed Joel and Ellie but left out another main character that becomes prominent about half way in the game. This completely ruined the experience for me because I felt they were trying to cheaply get me to care for this character after all the terrible things she did and will continue to do.\rWhere the game easily gets my praise is in the visual fidelity\\, especially running on what will soon be last-gen consoles this game looks great. From the animations\\, the lighting\\, the voice acting its actually all amazing. Clearly Naughtydog are masters of their craft I just for the life of me feel like no one was allowed to criticize the story internally. Its violent and gory and the entire theme of the game revolves around revenge and about how revenge is bad and the cycle of violence has to be stopped. You kill hundreds of people and zombies in this game and in only a handful of moments before committing incredible violence did people even stop for a second.\r30-35 hours of dehumanizing garbage\\, if there was ever a case for video games being too violent this one is hitting the upper edges of the scale. I have heard that some people really enjoy this game and i'm glad that you can enjoy something that i really couldn't.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
