Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you\\, Rian Johnson! Everyone has a version of this movie that has been living in their head or heart for three years; and yet\\, you've not made your movie or my movie\\, you've made the next installment of Star Wars. You've continued this story from a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away. In the past 24 hours I've debated and discussed\\, endorsed and questioned\\, and most of all\\, defended. Because you made these characters come to life again for us\\, we can question their decisions and their actions. Star Wars encompasses family\\, good\\, evil\\, corny jokes\\, reversals\\, coincidences\\, rogues\\, mentors\\, heroics\\, betrayals\\, redemptions--and always has. Thank you for making something living and specific\\, brave and true.","true":true}
