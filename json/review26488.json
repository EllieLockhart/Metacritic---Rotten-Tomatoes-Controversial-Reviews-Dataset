Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Obviously spoilers. This film focused to much on flash and not on story. It was stale with a few high points and to many low points. It was nice to see Yoda again and Luk as a mentor\\, but most what we saw with Luke wasn't who he was for three generations of fans\\, nor did this movie feel like Star Wars. The Leia superman scene was obsurd and pointless to the plot. Killing Luke off in the way they did it was poetic \\, but not needed resulting in walking out in utter disappointment. The movie even tried to tease some delight at the end by making the new Jar Jar character Fin seem to be killed off to be saved by yet another useless character that was introduced for a boring useless subplot that make you dislike them even more. This movie had such potential\\, but the powers that be chose to tease at us and then say this is not the movie your looking for resulting instead with a lack lustre and uninspiring movie","true":true}
