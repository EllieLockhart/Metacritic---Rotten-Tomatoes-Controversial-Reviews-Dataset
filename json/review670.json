It's characters are bland stereotypes\\, which you start to wish to see dead early on\\, have no clue what they are later\\, and just don't care a bit by the end. Early in the game our heroes participate in a lot of stupid pseudo-witty dialog\\, when every action taken by them sure to be accompanied with some awfully written remark\\, like when a hero opens a closed door he shouts something like \\\"Alakazam. Locky-unlocky!\\\" and it sounds as forced in a game as it does on paper.\r\rYou can mentally devide game's story into 2 parts: the buildup\\, which is really get's you excited\\, despite all the obvious plot holes it includes\\, and the \\\"payoff\\\" and i am using quotation marks intentionally. Soon after somewhere half of the game we are presented with a SHOCKING REVEAL that will leave you wandering just how would the script close all the gaps it provoked. It doesn't. Immediatly after instead of giving us answers you will be so desperate for\\, game introduces a new completely bland\\, extremely stereotypical character who gives away main story twist\\, which can easily be put in a few words.\r\rAfter that i just stopped caring completely until the title screen rolled.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
