Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie! It kept me engaged\\, moved me at different points and made me laugh at times as well.  I think the characters are very interesting and I adore Leia.  It hurt to see what happened to Luke\\, but I like the way things ended.  Looking forward to going back to the theater to see it again.","true":true}
