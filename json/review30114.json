Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly the movie felt more like a parodie of Star Wars than a movie that took the source material serious. It almost feels like the film makers wanted to be so smart with their plot twists they actually forgot to make a compelling\\, coherent and logical film and ended up parodying everything this universe stands for. A movie full of missed opportunities and unnecessary story lines that make you think why this movie had to be made in the first place.","true":true}
