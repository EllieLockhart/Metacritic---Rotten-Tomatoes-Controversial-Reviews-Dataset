Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, The Last Jedi is the second best Star Wars after Empire Strikes Back. Like a lot of Star Wars fans who grew up with Luke Skywalker as their hero\\, I too had initial issues with a defeated and depressed Luke who had decided to withdraw from a galaxy in need. But the broader message about failure and how to respond to it as well as the bigger questions about legacy and how to avoid the mistakes of the past are worth the cost of taking Luke's character to this place. I think The Last Jedi is groundbreaking\\, daring; and helps to solidify Star Wars as relevant to the issues facing us in the 21st Century.","true":true}
