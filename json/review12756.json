Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created a RT account just to rate this movie. I think newcomers to the franchise love this movie\\, but long-time fans who have been with it from the beginning will have a harder time. All movies establish their own universe\\, and laws of physics. This movie is a reboot\/reinvention. It violates almost every law\\, and even defies common sense. The story\/plot is ridiculously weak\\, the acting is horrible\\, the dialogue is awkward and riddled with cliche after cliche. We're expected to believe\/accept completely unbelievable situations.  The potential of the movie is completely wasted. Characters are given skills and\/or abilities they never trained for or that we've never witnessed in the franchise. They've turned this franchise into a Marvels super hero flick where the force sensitive characters can do anything on a whim.","true":true}
