Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible\\, terrible film. How was this given good reviews? It was awful. Really awful. I liked The Force Awakens but I have to ask what Rian Johnson was doing with this - an almost willful destruction and ruining of the franchise?","true":true}
