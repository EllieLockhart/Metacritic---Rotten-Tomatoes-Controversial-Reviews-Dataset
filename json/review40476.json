Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the greatest Star Wars movie EVER made. Watch the original 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, then watch 1\\, 2 \\,3. Then watch the Last Jedi and tell me it isn't the best and one of the greatest movies you've ever seen. \\n\\nGive me a break. I cannot see why they are panning this movie so badly. It is brilliant!!! Misa thinksa yousa guysa aresa idiotsa if you don't like this movie. \\n\\nGreatest Star Wars of Allll Time!!!!!!! I'm watching and reading those negative reviews as if they deserve to have every question answered like. They want to have Ray be a part of a privileged class. I think its great that she's a no body that became a somebody. Who gives a flying flip about where snoke came from? Not me. \\n\\nGREATEST EVER","true":true}
