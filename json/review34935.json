Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is tone deaf mess\\, it has no idea what it wants to be. The serious moments are riddled cliche and bad dialogue. The b-plot is dragged out and not engaging at all. Luke's character is wasted for more than half of the movie. It sets up a last film that has little intrigue","true":true}
