Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredibly disappointing Star Wars movie. The lack luster story telling\\, and the outright disrespect shown to established characters ham string this film. If you're a Star Wars fan this movie is not for you. If however you want to see dog fights in space and lots of stuff blow up then you'll enjoy it.\\n\\nIt's very clear that there is no longer room in Star Wars for the fandom.","true":true}
