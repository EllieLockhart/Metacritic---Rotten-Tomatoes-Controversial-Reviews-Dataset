Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a diehard Star Wars fan I will love anything  that this franchise produces. There were obvious flaws in this chapter of Star Wars and many things could have been changed to make this a better production. Finn needed a better Storyline\\, Rey's parental storyline needed a better plot\\, Luke's storyline was...well it was there\\, however\\, I still loved the story because it served its purpose. Star Wars no matter what happens\\, in my opinion\\, will always be the series that changed history. I will always stay with it and love it no matter what happens.","true":true}
