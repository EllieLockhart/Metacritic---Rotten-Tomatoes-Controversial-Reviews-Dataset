Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are moments of genuine brilliance in this film but sadly they are damaged by the much more frequent instances of awkwardly placed humour\\,  jarring tonal shifts and a complete disregard for rules\\, characters and plot points set up by all the previous movies.  I am a massive Star Wars fan\\, like lightsaber owning wookiepedia reading book owning fan...and I wanted to love this movie.  It was just a mess\\, put simply.  Classic characters get butchered and turned into weirdo version of themselves with no justification.  Other characters are utterly wasted (Phasma and Snoke) and don't even get me started on Leia's space walk.  Thank the force for Rogue One.","true":true}
