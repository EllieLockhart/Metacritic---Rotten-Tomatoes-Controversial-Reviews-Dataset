Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie since AoC. I can\u2019t believe Rian Johnson was given the keys to the future of Star Wars. My beloved franchise has been shattered to pieces. The greatest hero in American film history who was fearless and courageous is suddenly fearful? No lightsaber battles??? What the heck. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a great film in general but a terrible Star Wars film. Say what you want about the prequels but at least they were Star Wars films. Disney I hate you and Kathleen Kennedy you\u2019re a disgrace. There is so much more I want to talk about but whatever man. ","true":true}
