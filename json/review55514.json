Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My SPOILER FREE movie review for Star Wars The Last Jedi.\\n\\nWas it the best Star Wars movie ever? No\\nWas it better than The Force Awakens? Yes\\nDid I have a great time watching it? Yes\\nThere are a few jaw dropping moments that you want to avoid spoilers for. \\nA good mix of humour\\, serious emotion and action.\\nIt made me laugh\\, gasp and cheer. \\nThe CGI is amazing as is the music.\\nMark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were great. \\nWill I go see it again? Yes\\nIt's definitely a \\\"must see at the cinema experience\\\"\\nOverall\\, pretty good but had one or two questionable \\nplot\/character choices. \\nI liked it and give it 8 out of 10.\\n?? ??????","true":true}
