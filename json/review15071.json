Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater angry thinking that whoever wrote this was not a Star Wars fan. In fact\\,it feels so off I'd almost guess he had a complete disdain for it.  Some good visuals. I like all the characters\\, escoecially Rey but the plot was ridiculous and the screenwriting was cheap and lazy. Thanks\\, Disney. You've exceeded my expectations. And not in s good way. I've been a lifelong fan and have seen every movie in the theater multiple  times.  I doubt I'll see this one again and Rian's basically erased any point of watching the next one. What a pile of crap.","true":true}
