{"101487":147199,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this movie twice\\, and while I understand that some people would find it entertaining\\, I found it to be severely lacking in consistency\\, uninteresting and frankly insulting. The first thing that struck me in\\, what  tried to be an honest assessment of the movie\\, was how inconsistent it was with The Force Awakens; the Knights of Ren\\, Luke's map\\, the destruction of Starkiller base (like it never happened) and many\\, many more things that were never carried over. But I also found the story in the Last Jedi\\, just not that interesting. I actually was intrigued\\, and liked a Luke living on Ach-To\\, finding himself or the force\\, but where Johnson went with the story was bizarre\\, and unbelievable. Luke Skywalker throwing away his fathers lightsaber\\, considering the murder of his nephew\\, the introduction of Admiral Holdo and this weird battle\/chase with the First Order\\, and new found fuel shortages and I'll keep our tactics to myself Admiral. The Canto Bight foray and story line was painful\\, and could be cut out of the entire movie. I liked Finn more in this movie\\, than in TFA\\, as I felt he over acted in that movie\\, but I think his whole character arc was wasted\\, as was Captain Phasma\\, which was literally laughable\\, the buildup\\, the potential\\, to have her basically go down another garbage chute. While much of the movie felt lacking\\, some things felt forced\\, the comedy at times felt forced\\, the- what appears to be possibly pushing some social message ( which I won't get into\\, as it's very subjective but I do wonder why they did certain things) but this forcing of the overwhelming message to forget the past\\, and embrace the future\\, and that's fine\\, but  do it in a manner more befitting of the grand story\\, not a punchline\\, or head scratching confusion. Luke milking a sea creature\\, Leia flying through space (which looked rather ridiculous) no real mention of the death of Han Solo or its impact\\, using Chewbacca as comedic relief. It could have been so easy\\, so well done\\, but instead we have this confusing minutiae of plot holes\\, new story lines\\,and characters I personally don't care about\\, leaving you with this feeling of what the hell did I just watch.\\n\\n And I almost forgot about Snoke\\, Snoke was key to this story\\, and unless this is going to be picked up IX\\, it's going to make this bad situation even worse. Snoke was a fascinating villain\\,  who brought so much to the story\\, and I don't have a problem having him killed off\\, but what the heck\\, gives us some backstory. \\n\\n( Yoda was a joke. I was so excited to see force ghosts in this movie\\, and while some people liked it\\, his appearance looked ridiculous- but again this is subjective\\, and while the dialogue was ok\\, it could have been so much more\\, like this movie)\\n\\nThe movie was beautiful shot\\, the throne room scene was entertaining\\, the force bond with Rey and Kylo was good\\, Mark Hamill's acting was amazing\\, as was Adam Driver. Daisy Ridley\\, who I loved in the Force Awakens was not as appealing\\, her abilities without training detracted from the story\\, and leaves one scratching their head\\, but I think she is great choice to carry on the Jedi lineage\\, but heck\\, 2 training sessions\\, the unexplained abilities...\\n\\nI won't go see episode IX\\,I won't go see other SW movies\\, not to protest\\, not to have a hissy fit\\, its because I just don't like the stories anymore. If people want to go\\, if people are enjoying the movies- great\\, but for me\\, the Last Jedi ended my Star Wars fandom\\, and now I fade away\\, unfulfilled- what a shame at what could have been.","true":true}
