Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie fan\\, this was just not a very good movie. While there were good parts that flowed quite well\\, you are suddenly jerked out of the moment into something from left field that just didn't seem to belong in the movie. Right when it started to pick up and get a groove\\, it just stopped and took a right turn into a side street with a dead end. As a Star Wars fan it was simply horrible and just didn't have the ebb and flow of a Star Wars movie\\, even the Prequels...if you take out Jar Jar Binks\\, of course. This movie felt more like a B Rated Sci-Fi movie with a story that was 'inspired' rather than based on Star Wars but with a open checkbook for a budget. Just a bad movie\\, whether a Star Wars movie or not.","true":true}
