First\\, I'd like to tell you readers not to trust the user score distribution. I reloaded the screen and it went from negative reviews outnumbering the positive\\, to the positive outnumbering the negative and the number of negative reviews going down by a few thousand. I don't know what's happening\\, but my review may not last long here. Firstly\\, I played this game because it's a gift. I never played the first\\, but I watched a full playthrough of it and it was enough to make me feel hopeful. This game... does not hit the same way the first did. If you want to leave with a feeling of relief and hope for the future\\, don't get this game. It's not what you're expecting. The user score for this game is actually not majorly negative or positive from my experience. It's very neutral. In between. The players are very split. That's because this is a game that is not really a game for it's audience.\r\rThe reason why The Last of Us 2 isn't as great\\, is because it doesn't take into account it's audience. It has a good lesson\\, and it's executed well\\, but the lesson and execution does not fit the franchise. It was not created with it's audience in mind\\, one of the most basic things a game creator must consider. The Audience. Naughty Dog has gotten so absorbed into all the other aspects of creating a game that it has forgotten one of the most basic elements of all. The audience. It forces you to continue on a revenge storyline\\, which at the end\\, teaches you revenge is essentially bad. Sure\\, this is good for people who don't know what\\, but you can see from people's reactions\\, that the other half of the audience does know it.\r\rThe reason why those who hate it hate it so much\\, is because it forces people who don't like revenge\\, to continue on the route to see what happens to a character they love. I review it as a 3\/10 not because I don't care for the other aspects that they've put into it\\, but because they've neglected a basic element. Do note\\, I am not reviewing for everyone\\, simply for myself. It's spaghetti without tomato sauce\\, some people may like it\\, some may not. I don't review this to tell everyone it's bad\\, but to warn those who think alike me.\r\rIf you are like me\\, and dislike revenge and would rather not be forced to carry out revenge to get it hammered in your head that it is bad\\, don't play it. Even if it's a gift. You will feel extremely frustrated and tired before the first hour is out.\r\rIf you do believe revenge isn't so bad\\, or playing the game to see how they teach the lesson would be nice\\, I recommend you play it. You may enjoy it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
