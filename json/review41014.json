Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie failed in so many ways. But face it\\, there's a new audience out there that will carry this movie to box office success. Storyline was could have been better\\, Carrie Fishers character finally was shown using the force in a ridiculous unbelievable way. So much more i could go on\\, but I'll let the generous 2 star review speak for itself. Sad end to a franchise that will now be exploited for years to come. George Lucas is not happy i can imagine. Hope the 2 bIllion dollar's was worth selling your company Sir George.","true":true}
