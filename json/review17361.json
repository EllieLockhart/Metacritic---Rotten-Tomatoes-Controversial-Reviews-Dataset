Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Irredeemable garbage. Sacrifices writing for political messages. The plot is an incoherent mess\\, both with itself and with the rest of the series. An insult to the intelligence of fans and non-fans alike. Episode one all over again.","true":true}
