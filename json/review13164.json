Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't nessecarily disagree with any of the decisions Rian Johnson and others made in regards to the story and the direction of the characters; I loved how unique it was in terms of a Star Wars movie. However\\, the execution of those desicions seemed to be the failure of this movie for me. The comedy was certainly NOT organic; in fact it may have been the most derailing element of the whole movie. And once I was off the rails\\, I couldn't get back on. No matter how much I wanted to believe in the characters desicions\\, arcs\\, and newly found powers\\, and no matter how much I love the Star Wars saga as a whole\\, I just couldn't get back on the track\\, and I didn't believe anything I was seeing as an audience member. I will be watching this again to try and appreciate more of the good desicions the film makers made\\, but as for my first viewing I was underwhelmed and disappointed. ","true":true}
