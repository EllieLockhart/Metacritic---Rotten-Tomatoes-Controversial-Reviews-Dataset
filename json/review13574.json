Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt Arian Johnson did a tremendous job in bringing the saga back to its center after Abrams felt it necessary to  put in 50 gazillion things that needed to be figured out.\\n\\nHamill's performance as an old hermit who felt scorned by the force was incredible.\\n\\nMost of the reviews I hear of people who didn't like it were fanboys mad that Johnson didn't take the story in directions they wanted or answer questions the way they wanted them answered.","true":true}
