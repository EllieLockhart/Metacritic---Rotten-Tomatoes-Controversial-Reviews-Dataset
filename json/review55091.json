Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie so badly. I wanted to LOVE this movie. But everything about it screamed that the director did not care about the actual Star Wars saga. This movie ruined star wars for me\\, and I am very dissappointed. Terrible story\\, plot lines only used to make weird political points? Who goes to see Star Wars to listen about how the rich exposes the lower class?! And learn about animal rights!? Really? I just wanted to enjoy a movie and love the continuation of the saga. Also\\, Rose is one of the worst characters I've ever seen. They somehow made this move 3 hours long while also leaving out every plot point that the audience was looking forward to. \\n\\nFinally\\, if the next director wants to save this series? In the next movie\\, please make Kylo Ren an actual badass. This whiny dude should not be the leader of the \\\"first order\\\"\\, it's hard to watch.","true":true}
