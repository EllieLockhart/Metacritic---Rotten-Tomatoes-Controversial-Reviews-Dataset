Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has it's moments\\, complemented by the breathtaking visuals and mindblowing music.However\\, it is overshadowed by the plot\\, missed opportunities\\, non-developed characters\\, and political themes.","true":true}
