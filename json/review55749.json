Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I loved Last Jedi. It's more of a character driven film than a plot driven one\\, which was interesting to see. When looking at the main theme of the film\\, failure\\, I think this makes sense\\, as one cannot expect much progress to be made in a film where to focus is on what goes wrong. Much like the Empire Strikes back\\, I think this film has initially rubbed fans the wrong way\\, but there is no doubt in my mind that it will come to be well loved like ESB is. I did have some issues\\, hence the 4 stars instead of five- mainly with the pacing. However\\, I found that the characters were so engaging\\, and watching them develop over the course of the movie so enjoyable\\, that I was able to sit through this rather long film and not be put off by the sometimes choppy progression. I am thoroughly looking forward to Episode IX\\, where I hope that we get more of the brilliant character growth that we saw in this film.","true":true}
