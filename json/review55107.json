Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed in The Last Jedi. The movie failed to explain plot lines that the Force Awakens began. There was no back story or expansion on Snoke. Rey's parentage amounted to nothing after being set up to be potentially so much more. Luke in hiding resulted in a complete reversal in character that episodes 4-6 built up. These were all disappointing moments to see. The editing of the film could have been much better. When Rey appears on the Supremacy\\, there's no explanation for how she got there and why she is all of a sudden standing next to Kylo Ren. The overall plot was weak. So much more could have been done with two galactic factions vying for control\\, but instead we were given a two hour ship chase that felt like a day at the snail races. It lacked the excitement of the original trilogy as well as the political intrigue of the prequels. Kylo \\nRen is a great character\\, who is the sole redeeming quality of this new trilogy. All the actors did a great job for the most part\\, but the acting was not enough to save a film lacking in substantial plot\\, editing\\, and immersion. This did not feel like a Star Wars movie to me but neither did the Force Awakens. I thought Disney did an excellent job with Rogue One\\, but Rogue One also had an already established storyline assisting it. The Last Jedi is a new frontier and so far\\, the frontier is barren.","true":true}
