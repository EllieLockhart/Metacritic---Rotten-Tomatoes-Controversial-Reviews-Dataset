Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It would be a fun movie if it weren't a Star Wars movie. I don't want to spoil anything\\, so I will simply say\\, this was a film made to make money\\, and not made for the Star Wars fans themselves. There was a lot of dumb stuff in here\\, and a mismanagement of plot resources. This is the last Star Wars Movie I will be watching\\, until Disney can start telling a good Star Wars story again.","true":true}
