Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars needed to renew itself\\, break the wheel if you will\\, and that's what they've done. Our heroes aren't Mary Sues who make perfect choices. They are older and flawed\\, weary and dispirited. I commend Rian Johnson for making some bold choices about character development\\, and avoiding falling into the trap of making an Empire 2.0. Just like the criticism Empire faced upon release\\, this film will be remembered more fondly in the future.","true":true}
