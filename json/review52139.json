Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" brought me back to a galaxy far far away and made me feel like a kid again I was beyond excited for this movie. What I got was a sense of sadness in the movie theater. The handling of Luke who was the symbol of hope and optimism was an insult to all Star Wars fans. Just to circumvent expectations. Doing something for shock factor does not make it good. The entire plot of the movie was pointless. If General Holdo had used some basic management skills and communicated the plan to the staff so many issues could have been resolved and a lot of lives could have been saved. What a mess of a movie.","true":true}
