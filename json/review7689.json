Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Exceeded my expectations after the first one being the same script essentially as episode 4 but Rogue and this one had new story lines and not bad either. Don't get me wrong it was no Thrawn trillog but for Disney writers not bad at all i really enjoyed it. Just hope you can up your game in the future maybe even consider some of the great stories already out there for the quality the subject matter truly deserves Disney think about it?","true":true}
