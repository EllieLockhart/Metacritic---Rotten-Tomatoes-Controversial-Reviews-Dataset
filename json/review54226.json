Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have seen the other SW films first. This one adds to the action\\, drama\\, suspense. It is a welcomed member to the SW saga to me\\, which started in a galaxy far\\,far\\, away\\, way before I was born. I liked the juxtaposition of characters and the fresh characters that didnt seem to be the usual. By that I mean\\, they were easy to see as ordinary folks caught up in this big mess\\, that being the empire and rebel conflict. With that said\\, I felt like I was joining in on the battle\\, or at least feeling I was there first hand to witness the historic events unfold.","true":true}
