Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gaping plot holes\\, tonal differences and sharp contradictions in moral message and theme. Cheesy character motivations and humour that is completely out of place and come at the expense of characterisation (Rey is an all powerful rube\\, Hux is moron villain without malice and Luke has spent the last 20 yrs sucking the nipples of a pace moose). The Film is a visual spectacle but otherwise falls short of  The Force Awakens.","true":true}
