Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a title so intriguing it makes all viewers want to explore the question\\, \\\"who is the last Jedi?\\\" I'm not necessarily excited\\, rather than interested in the film. The cinematography in the last movie was outstanding. Though\\, the new film has a new director\\, which isn't always the best option. Rogue One truly wowed the crowed and it to had a new director. With that being said\\, the director of the project filmed such movies as \\\"Looper\\\"\\, so we truly can't judge until we watch.","true":true}
