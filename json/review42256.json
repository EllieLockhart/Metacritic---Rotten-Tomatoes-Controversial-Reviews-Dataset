Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie subverts the typical Star Wars formula in so many ways that even a veteran of the series will be on the edge of their seat and leave surprised. This movie delves deeper into the philosophy of the conflict between good and bad as well as the tendency to cling to past ideals and moving on. Really good movie\\, really good message. Absolutely loved it. Also Rose is a really good\\, compelling character. Her character is a perspective not seen often and I'm glad she was included in this movie\\, really loved her. Hope she plays an even bigger role in the next movie.","true":true}
