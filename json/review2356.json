Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At the end of the day\\, I highly enjoyed this film. It is filled to the brim with spectacular visuals and cinematography\\, although the acting and plot fall pretty short of its original predecessors. Mark Hamill is an interesting exception\\, followed by an unusual\\, enthralling and bombastic performance by Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Overall\\, the movie had some major flaws\\, but with managed expectations\\, The Last Jedi delivers confirmed entertainment with a bit too many laughs.","true":true}
