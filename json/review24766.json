Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much has been said about this movie. Go watch almost any rant review on YT and you'll know what's wrong with it. I'm not going to waste my time reviewing\\, as I already wasted it by going to the theatre. The only good thing about this \\\"masterpiece\\\" are visuals and sound. Good acting got wasted by terrible writing.","true":true}
