Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An awful writing giving a mess of a film.\\nPlotholes\\, deux ex machinas\\, useless subplots and characters\\, what kind of movie have we been forced to watch? Nothing more than porgs goofing around for the pleasure of small kids. \\n\\nDumb\\, mean\\, empty and shallow . This movie ressemble the new target audience.","true":true}
