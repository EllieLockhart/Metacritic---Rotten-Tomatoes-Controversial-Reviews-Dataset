Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A message for the \\\"professional\\\" critics.\\n\\nMaybe you have watched the movie in a period of very high hype\\, when Disney flooded the critics sites with paid comments and scores.\\nSame thing happened to me\\, so I know what I'm talking about. During the movie\\, I subconsciously noticed blatant inconsistencies\\, political agendas and bad jokes\\, but I DESPERATELY WANTED TO LIKE THE MOVIE!\\nAfter all the dust settled\\, I started to re-view the movie in my mind and started to ask myself: \\\"why the hell did you like this pile of crap?\\\".\\nThen I started reading the REAL critics\\, those of the REAL people\\, and I discovered that they ALL had the same sentiment towards this movie.\\n\\nSO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE\\, dear \\\"professional\\\" critics writers\\, rewatch the movie\\, if you can\\, and review your critics. You will be surprised of how your words discredited you and destroyed your reputation as an honest\\, impartial\\, non-paid-for movie critic.\\n\\nPlease note that we will check what you wrote about this movie before according or negating you credibility for critics you may write for other movies.\\nIf you have indeed been paid by Disney\\, or if you fear their revenge\\, well... maybe this is not the right job for you.\\n\\nA message to Rotten Tomatoes: C'mon dudes! Math is not an opinion. Hundred of pages with scores between 0 and 1 cannot possibly give a score of 49%.\\nWhy don't you show the actual score? Do you fear Disney's revenge? If so\\, please shut down the site and go home\\, you losers.","true":true}
