Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has its moments\\, but overall\\, the treatment of one of the most iconic characters in the last century of movies was unforgivable. Johnson and Disney would have done well to heed Mark Hamill's initial reaction to the script. Instead\\, in an understandable attempt to finalize the handoff of the franchise from the old to the new\\, the studio rammed an irritating message of \\\"geez\\, just move on\\\" down the throats of fans of the original trilogy. Compound that with poor character development - Snoke\\, Phasma\\, \\\"The master codebreaker\\,\\\" etc. (hell\\, they even got a second chance with Phasma and STILL screwed it up!) - and wonky story decisions\\, and I just cannot recommend this addition to the Star Wars library. And I don't say that lightly. I never even criticized Episodes 1 through 3. But the horrible taste left in my mouth at the end of this film forced me to create a Rotten Tomatoes account and review a film for the first time in my life. It's that heinous. In short\\, you have to see it - because it's Star Wars - but don't expect to like it.","true":true}
