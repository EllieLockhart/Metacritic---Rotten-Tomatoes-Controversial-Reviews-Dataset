Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They ruined Luke Skywalker in this film. It's a very beautiful film to look at\\, but the script is very weak\\, characters make decisions that make no logical sense\\, characters' legacies from previous films are destroyed\\, and this film also ignores all lore\/in-universe rules established in the first 6 films. No film has ever irritated me so much as this.","true":true}
