Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's one thing to make a movie with plot twists and defying expectations when it makes sense and without throwing out everything that has come before it. It's another to change characters entirely and throw in expectation defying moments all for the sake of surprising the audience. Good cinema isn't about surprising the audience\\, it's about telling a good story that keeps audience interest. You can get interest from twists\\, but when those twist exist for the sake of throwing the narrative on its head\\, you have a problem with your movie.","true":true}
