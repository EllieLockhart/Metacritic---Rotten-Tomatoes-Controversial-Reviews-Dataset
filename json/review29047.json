Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"really great film plot is good but i dont understand this star wars ep 3 :65% star wars ep 8:63%","true":true}
