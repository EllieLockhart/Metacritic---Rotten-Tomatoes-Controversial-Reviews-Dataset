Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good film in general\\, but it did more bad than good to the star wars franchise and I didn't mind the character of rose. I thought she COULD have added great character development to Finn. But no. What they did with her was bad. Apart from the throwing the lightasber off the cliff thing\\, I loved what Rian Johnson did with Luke Skywalker. Watch the film once you've watched episodes 1-3 then Solo then Rogue One then 4-7.","true":true}
