Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Constant continuity errors. Lack of stable and clear plot. Way too preachy. The writers somehow managed to give unneeded nods to the previous movies whilst lacking to provide a movie that exhibits the true Star Wars feel. The movie as a whole felt plastic\\, a knockoff of its predecessors. The comedy was terrible\\, felt like a Marvel movie (which Star Wars isn't!) and felt forced in most instances. Luke's death was horribly handled and the Finn\/Rose relationship should never have existed. I felt that the character of Rose lacked depth and was an unneeded addition to what is already an overloaded cast of characters. Similarly\\, the movie should have completely left out DJ- the casino planet sequence simply weighed down the movie. Admiral Hux's character seemed unrealistic and comical in what should have been a serious role (think grand moff tarkin). The kylo ren\/Rey relationship was the   one redeeming aspect of the movie. But kylo ren without a shirt  on? Gross.\\nSadly\\, Disney's grubby hands have marred what was once a marvelous franchise. Disney has produced the unthinkable- a movie worse than any of the prequels.\\nStar Wars is dead.","true":true}
