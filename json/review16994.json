Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really didn't like The Last Jedi. I'm a huge fan of the original star wars trilogy as I grew up watching them so those are obviously my favorites in the series. Although I am less fond prequels\\, i did enjoy most of those as well.  I also really liked The Force Awakens. Although the plot seemed to be a rehash of A New Hope\\, I enjoyed and was excited to see where the story would go next. \\n\\nPrior to watching Episode 8\\, I avoided reading any reviews because I didn't want to be influenced. When I finally watched episode 8\\, I was underwhelmed to say the least. I really hated the way Luke Skywalker's character was written and treated. It seemed like a slap in the face to the original trilogy. It also made no sense how Rey's character was so powerful with no real training. Also the scene where Leia flies through space like Mary Poppins was probably the single dumbest thing I've seen in any Star Wars film. The entire subplot involving the casino seemed unnecessary and pointless and would probably make the film better if had been excluded. I also didn't care for was the whole subplot\/conflict between Laura Dern's character of Poe. The whole script just seemed like lazy writing to me. After this entry\\, I honestly could care less about episode 9.","true":true}
