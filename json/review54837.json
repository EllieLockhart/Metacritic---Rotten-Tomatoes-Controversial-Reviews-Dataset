Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is different that any star wars film to date and thats a good thing.  Since the creation of the new trilogy\\, one complaint has been the sameness of the story.  TLJ goes a long way towards trying something new on the big screen for a 40 year old series.  What is interesting is that it takes a lot of cues from the small screen versions of star wars that have come out over the last decade.  The Clone Wars and Rebels have had a lot of freedom to experiment with formate and story telling in a way that the tent pole films have not.  TLJ is amazing because it takes those experiments and tries them out on the big screen.  It is arguably one of the most visually stunning and artistic films of the saga with bold color choices\\, incredible sound design\\, and frames that might as well come from a comic book.  While some of the B plots seem to be wheel spinning\\, the overall thesis of the film supports what they are creating.  As a life long fan its important that the series continues to evolve and explore.  We have so many stagnant franchises that are afraid to go where The Last Jedi goes.","true":true}
