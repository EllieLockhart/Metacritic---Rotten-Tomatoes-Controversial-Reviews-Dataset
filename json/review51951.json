Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A franchise reduced to nothing more than a few glimpses of why we loved it\\, yet covered in millennial treacle that will please newcomers. The film whilst entertaining is filled with plots that go nowhere. Characters known and loved for over 30 years are treated with little respect and by extension so is the fanbase. The ultimate crime being the demise of Luke Skywalker himself in a fairly limp and zen way. Whilst no one was expecting the world\\, the reason this has caused anger is fans is simply due to the passions that surround these characters and their stories. None of that has been respected and we are now forced to move forward by a Disney mandate. Your kids 15 and under will still love it as it harks to Harry Potter\\, hence the millennial love.","true":true}
