Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an abomination. Anyone who has known star wars for any length of time or understands why the original trilogy was so good will hate this film. I ould cite all of the plotholes\\, of which there are a vast number but I don't think that these are what ruins the film\\, it's the characters. Every character is now totally hollow\\, they all make completely erratic\\, incoherent decisions in practically every scene which often contradict decades of character development and world building that has taken place up to this point. This film is a disrespectful\\, irreverent\\, disgusting slap in the face of long time fans of the series. As a result of the last jedi I will never spend money on a disney product again\\, myself being someone who has in the last 25 years spent hundreds if not thousands on items relating to this franchise. Star wars is dead to me.","true":true}
