Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I greatly enjoyed the entire movie all the way through. It was only after watching it and letting it sit in my mind that I realised there were a couple of dumb things in the movie but they don't change the fact that this is a quality piece of Star Wars media.","true":true}
