Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrendous. Destroyed what little faith I had left in the new Star Wars trilogy possibly living up to the lifetime of joy I have experienced from previous stories in films & other mediums. A complete cinematic failure with no logical planning for the characters or plot leading to completely incoherent storytelling that had no basis on the preceding film\\, all while spitting in its fanbase's (or anyone with a modicum of intelligence) face.  If you love Star Wars yet have somehow been supremely fortunate enough not to have seen this movie then please\\, for the love of whichever deity you pray to\\, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It will destroy the franchise for you.  If you're like me & have already been stabbed in the back by Disney & had your heart broken by your favorite franchise then the only potential solution is to henceforth discount all Disney produced Star Wars content as merely \\\"fanfiction drivel\\\" with nice special effects (i.e. not canon).","true":true}
