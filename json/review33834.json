Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible no sense ruined what could have been great. I don't think he watched the last movie or any Star Wars for that matter. Bad plot terrible subplot no pay off. Mystery from last film shrugged off with out care. Don't see it save your money and your time","true":true}
