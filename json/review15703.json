Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. In my opinion\\, it was one of the more original Star Wars stories. I feel like people didn't like it as much because it didn't answer all the questions in the way they wanted and didn't just shoot you back into the goody Star Wars nostalgia feeling that TFA did. But this movie was never meant to do that. The story was unique and progressed the story of the saga. I'm super pumped for Rian Johnson to do another trilogy now.","true":true}
