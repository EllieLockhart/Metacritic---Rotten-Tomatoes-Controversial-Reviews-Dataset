Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie plays to the lowest common denominator. A majority of the dialogue is stating the obvious\\, and redundant to the visuals. I always watch a movie with an open mind\\, ready to be taken wherever the story tellers choose\\, in hopes that there will be moments of awe and surprise and intrigue\\, but this film had none.  There are no moments of sincere character development. There are no attempts to craft a single well written scene. It's just sad. The very reason Star Wars is Star Wars is because of strong characters. And these new characters are terrible. They didn't have to be\\, but they are because of incredibly timid storytelling\\, and a lack of faith in the intelligence of the audience. I know Rian Johnson can be a great director and Kathleen Kennedy is one of the greatest producers of all time. But together on a Star Wars Skywalker Trilogy film they seem to be completely out of their element.","true":true}
