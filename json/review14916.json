Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I joined up on here purely to to air my dismay at this total dissapointment. Just such a let down and reading through all the other reviews many have put it far better than I could. \\n\\nWhat is more concerning though is the obvious fake high scoring reviews on here - some are obviously cut and paste or automated falsifications. This is putting Rotten Tomatoes in a bad light and I'm losing respect for what I originally thought was a genuine movie resource.","true":true}
