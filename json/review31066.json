{"101487":167910,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-05","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, I'm gonna be one of the few people who rates this movie anything but 1 star. Now now\\, before the fan boys come out and trash this review\\, hear me out okay? :D (A bit of Spoilers ahead\\, only for this review... I think)\\n\\nSo we have the story beginning with the First Order chasing down the Resistance. If you watched the Force Awakens\\, it should be blatantly clear to you that Rian has dumped that setup. This idea is the most prevalent throughout the movie. Rian has essentially given a very deliberate middle finger to J.J. Abrams.\\n\\nLet's skip over to when Rey finds Luke at the Island Planet. Luke asks Rey TWICE: \\\"Why are you here?\\\"\\, to which Rey answers (paraphrasing): \\\"idk man\\\". With this alone\\, Rian has shined a spotlight on Rey\\, showing those watching as to why Rey's character is horrendously bad. She doesn't have any goals. She doesn't have any aspirations. She is NOT the heroine archetype that fits the story. Following that vein\\, in another scene Snoke gets on Kylo's case saying he was \\\"bested by a girl who never touched a light saber before. YOU FAIL!\\\". Hilarious. Good stuff Rian.\\n\\nThen there's the thing about Admiral Purple Hair. She's just the kind of commander you'd want commanding the Resistance while Leia is recovering from out-MarySueing Rey (literally \\\"forces\\\" herself back to the ship after being thrown out of it into space [no logic required dooooh])\\, isn't she? *sarcasm* Poe asks her after her rather useless speech (only information gotten out of it is that the ship contains the last of the Resistance) about what the plan is\\, only to get a bunch of sassy remarks from her essentially telling him to \\\"fuck off\\\". And somehow\\, this lady gets a scene where she becomes a martyr for the Resistance's escape.\\n\\nMoving onto to the point where Kylo and Rey are in Snoke's chamber. The character who was expected some form of backstory from\\, gets killed off in the stupidest way conceivable. And there's no background whatsoever. Genius. \\n\\nWhat really got me howling though\\, is when Finn (arguably one of the most useless characters in the series) is about to FINALLY get his spotlight when he flies into the space cannon trying to bust open the doors behind which the resistance is hiding for safety. And then he gets saved by Rose. This is followed by a \\\"glorious\\\" line from her where she says\\, \\\"This is how we're gonna win. Not by killing what we hate. But by saving what we love\\\". And then the cannon busts those doors open\\, only offering the Resistance its rushed and messy demise. You know what makes this funnier? The fact that Rose's sister was the one in the first scene who died trying to save the Resistance\\, and SHE ends up being the reason why the Resistance ends up in one of the most perilous situations. Top comedy gold guys\\, your money has been worth it.\\n\\nFF to when Luke confronts Kylo. Luke is shown to be a complete badass while confronting Kylo this scene\\, surviving a bunch of cannon blasts and answering to every blow Kylo deals him. And then it's revealed that Kylo was fighting a hologram this whole while. Tbh\\, I was quite disappointed with this reveal initially. It took me a few more runs before I could really appreciate how much of a big middle finger this was to all the fans.Luke peaces out after this\\, with a small tribute to Obi-wan's demise in the Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nSee\\, J.J. made \\\"A new Hope\\\" and repackaged it to the masses. Rian could have done the same and this movie would be a well-liked film for the short term. So why wouldn't he do it? This movie is NOWHERE CLOSE to The Empire Strikes Back. He could easily have done that.\\n\\nI think Rian never wanted it to be that. I think he decided to crash the franchise by making a movie with gaping plot holes in its story\\, and its characters doing all sorts of nonsensical actions that would NEVER happen if George Lucas or even J.J. were behind the helm. Yoda wanted to complete training Luke EVEN after Luke wanted to save Leia\\, and now here Yoda tells Luke that the Jedi texts are worth shit. Luke ran off from his training to save his sister once he found out\\, now he reluctantly decided to train Rey after Chewbacca persuaded him to (and then tells Rey to fuck off after seeing how Mary-Suish she is). \\n\\nBetter still\\, he gives the biggest middle finger to the SJWs. Every female character in the movie is shown as either useless or outright dangerous. Detrimental to the Resistance even. Couldn't do that to Rey of course. That's heresy. :p\\n\\nThe most deliberate middle finger to the SJWs. I wonder if they even caught that\\, tbh.\\n\\nThis movie kills all its characters\\, all the overarching plot lines\\, EVERYTHING. I only rate this what I do\\, because even as much as I enjoyed all the middle fingers flipped at the audience\\, there is no good story in it. It is a very bad movie\\, and I'm not denying it. But yes\\, disney\\, hope you got the message from Rian. STOP TRYING TO MILK THE CASH COW. LEAVE THE FRANCHISE BE.","true":true}
