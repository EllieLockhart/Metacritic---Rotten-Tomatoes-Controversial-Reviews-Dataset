Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a constant string of \\\"oh\\, that's unexpected\\\"... But not in a good way. Too many inconsistencies\\, lots of new force habilites that didn't belong to anything that we've seen before. Milking weird animals\\, weird characters\\, killing off potentially great characters\\, stupid jokes\\, liberating animals but not slave children\\, hyped new characters that were badly there... The movie is a mess!!!","true":true}
