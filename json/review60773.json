I do think it dragged on slightly too long\\, at the least the last 5 hours or so and went back and forth in it's revenge plot one too many times.  There were two flashback sequences that just involved too much walking around and talking I found particularly boring at times as well.  Overall it was worth the $80 I paid.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
