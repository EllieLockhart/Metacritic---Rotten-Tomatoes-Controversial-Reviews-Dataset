Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the Star Wars movie we were looking for.  Full of holes\\, and it seems more like Johnson\/Disney were breaking as many star wars \\\"toys\\\" as possible to gain attention.  Might be the last one I see.  Great to see Hamil again and sadly beneath what Carrie Fisher' s last performance should have been for what they created for her.","true":true}
