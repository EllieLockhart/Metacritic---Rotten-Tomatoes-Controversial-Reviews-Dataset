Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was all I wanted to see form Star Wars.\\nThis movie has gorgeous special effects\\, surprising plot twists and magnificent cinematography.\\nI see lots of comments with arguments like: Star Wars isn't a space-opera anymore (have you ever seen Star Wars or did you just listen to interviews with George Lucas? Because to be honest it never really was.)\\, Rey is a Mary Sue (Like Luke had to do lots of training to blow up a Death Star\\, he just can randomly fly and use the force without training.)\\, this movie cheats with the force\\, that Leia scene was ridiculous (Before ESB you couldn't move objects with the force\\, before PM you couldn't force jump\\,...) \\,and the list goes on and on.\\nPeople can't enjoy movies anymore becaus they feel themselves too important because they can write reviews. To be honest nobody cares\\, if you even read this it is a freaking miracle.\\n\\nMay the force be with you and be a good boy. (Leave cast mebers alone\\, the actor from Jar Jar wanted to commit suicide because of \\\"fans\\\".)","true":true}
