We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So\\, where should I start. I am (now was) a big fan of the 'The Last of Us' franchise. Finished the first part 2 times on PS3\\, 4 times on PS4. To keep it short: If you aren't sure if to buy it and never saw anything from the first Part\\, leave it and spend the money on something better. The gameplay is pretty nice\\, like the graphics. Its a story relevant game. And that's where it fails. The story is horrible and so poorly made. Its supposed to be a game of the adventure of Ellie and Joel. You play 49% Ellie\\, 50% Abby and poor 1% Joel. In my impression in total this game is made of 30% Ellie\\, 30% Abby\\, 30% cut scenes and 10% loading screens. That's it. I even accidentally skipped the death of Joel and just saw what happened in my second playthrough and I still don't know\\, what happened with Tommy\\, because I was and still am so annoyed of those cutscenes. Why do you make us play the killer of Joel for half of the game? Add some more backround story of Abby\\, before she kills Joel\\, so we can feel why she did that. The death of Joel is so poorly made. My tip for Naughty Dog: Remove the really poor death of Joel and sell it as a spin-off. This franchise did'nt deserve such a bad continuation. Its an absolute money waste. I pre-ordered the Collectors Edition. The Collectors Edition\\, content and figure is really nice\\, but I wasted 230\u20ac in total for this game. My expectation was really high\\, when I started this game. Fun went to 0 in minutes. Just grinded for the platinum trophy (when I received it\\, super rare with 0.3%)\\, packed the blu-ray back in the box and gone in the basement. Save your money\\, don't buy it. If you really want it\\, wait for a sale. Don't buy it at least for the full price.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
