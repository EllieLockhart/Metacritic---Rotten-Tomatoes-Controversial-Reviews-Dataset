Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so horrible I want my money back! I feel cheated by Disney and Rain Johnson. I will watch episode 9 but I will not pay a single cent to watch it (torrentz). Maybe if they have a loss of hundreds of millions they will make a cool\\, interesting and plausible movie from SW universe that will not destroy all characters\\, lore and common sense. Stop dumbing down everything!","true":true}
