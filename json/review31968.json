Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers Ahead! Let me just start by saying I grew up in the 90's with the original 3 films so I am very much a long time fan of the series. So much of a fan in fact I owned the books and even watched phantom menace 7 times in the theatre\\, yes only a true fan would endure such torture. \\n\\nI went into this film having not read any reviews and under the assumption they would play it safe and follow the same formula as its prequel i.e. OG trilogy rehash. I couldn't have been more wrong\\, this movie takes every cliche\\, trope\\, safe spot and slams it against a wall before casting it aside. Every minute of it became an ever increasing smile on my face as finally I was treated to having all of my predictions shattered\\, and questions unanswered\\, simply because the questions themselves were fodder. Who cares what Snope's backstory was it's not relevant\\, we have been there and done that. I went from being shocked that Yoda would destroy ancient texts to laughing because oddly it suits his character. This movie was about balance from the beginning. Snoke had to go so Rey and Kylo could balance the force (which became evident during their force struggle with the lightsaber) Luke also had to go for the same reason\\, taking back his affinity with the force meant things were now unbalanced once again\\, and had to return to that state. This was not the same rehashed tale we have all seen a million times\\, this was incredibly refreshing. This movie is also the best I've seen as far as Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher's characters in this universe. Yeah\\, it was kinda cheesy her floating through space\\, but seeing the princess command the force like that for the first time ever was incredible to watch. \\n\\nLike any other movie from the saga it does have some points that make you question some of the decision making\\, especially the sidequest to find the hacker while everybody else just chills and slowly gets fired on. All in all though\\, nothing could ever beat empire for me through all of these years. That is until now. For me this is the greatest of all the films in the series. It will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy\\, and it's about time.","true":true}
