Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the best star wars movie since Empire strikes back. I really don't  know why there is a terrible audience score\\,this is a fantastic star wars movie. It show us more of the dark side\\, and what It can do to people who are seduced by it. The cast is charming and grand Especially Mark Hamils performance as Luke Skywalker\\, he nailed it. The score is better then previous star wars movies\\, the visual effects are great looking\\, and this movie is actually funny at times\\, and has every right to be.","true":true}
