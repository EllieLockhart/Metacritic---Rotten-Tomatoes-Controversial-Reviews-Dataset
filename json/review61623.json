Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I love narrative driven games. Love them.... I\u2019m frequently telling everyone I know that Hollywood is done\\, and the real talent and stories are in gaming.\rAfter all\\, just look at RDR\\, RDR2 and TLOU.\r\rI never wanted a sequel. I know from the get go\\, that to make it as emotional\\, they\u2019d kill Joel. Which IMO was just bad\\, lazy writing\\, but I was sure that was what they\u2019d do.\r\rI was expecting a John Marston\/Arthur Morgan quality story of redemption... after all\\, this is Naughty Dog. They thrive in story telling\\, don\u2019t they?\r\rNope. No they do not.\rTLOU2 takes one of them most cliched and overused plots of any bad B movie ever\\, and makes it into the main plot.\rThen gives up any desire for character development or even trying to stay true to what we know about these characters And destroys them immediately.\rThe nice thing about TLOU was the subtle nod to Ellie being gay. Subtle being the main point... we didn\u2019t need it rubbed in our faces\\, because Ellie was a great character\\, and so it didn\u2019t matter what she was. It was barely a blip on the radar.\rTLOU2 takes that subtlety and beats you round the head with it so badly\\, that any negative comments on this game automatically get you labelled as homophobic or transphobic.\r\rNeil. It\u2019s great you want to support these communities\\, but leave your politics out of the damn game!\r\rAs for Joel. I can deal with character death. I do t gave to like it\\, but given that the RDR games are 2 of the greatest ever made IMO\\, I can accept it if it serves the story.\r\rJoel\u2019s death does NOTHING for the story. Nothing. The man who ran over someone in the last game just because he had a \u201cfeeling\u201d something wasn\u2019t right\\, willingly goes with a group of strangers and tells them everything. He then proceeds to be beaten to death in glorious HD by a woman. The daughter of the surgeon he killed in the first game (I did mention the plot was utter dog **** didn\u2019t I?)\r\rNot only are you then forced to play as the person who killed one of the most beloved characters in gaming for 10 hours\\, whilst we \u201clearn\u201d about her. Not only did I not want to know anything about her\\, what we did learn was boring and mundane cliched bull****.\r\rThen at the climax of a game all about revenge...and this game is pretty brutal. I\u2019ve seen it described as torture porn - and that\u2019s pretty accurate... you have your one chance of revenge taken away from you.\r\rBecause revenge is bad people...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
