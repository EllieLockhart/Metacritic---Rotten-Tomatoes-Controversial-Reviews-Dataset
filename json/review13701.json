Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally saw this movie today on Netflix. I've been using RT for several months\\, but never felt the need to make an account\\, but I really wanted to share my disappointment about The Last Jedi. Granted this movie might not be so bad if you've never seen a Star Wars movie and had no idea who the characters were and what their history was\\, or what the tone and tenor of a Star Wars movie was all about. This installment seems like a Seth MacFarlane parody\\, with quips and gimmicks better suited for a Fast and Furious movie or an after-school special.","true":true}
