Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the film was brilliant but I'm not a huge fan.  My husband however is Star Wars daft (not episodes 1\\,2\\,3)\\, and he loved it; thought it was as good if not better than The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
