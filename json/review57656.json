Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total letdown! Any questions that need answering get really lazy and meaningless answers that made me want to just walk out of the theater. So much potential just thrown out all for the sake of \u201cplot twists\u201d that make the whole movie a complete waste of time and money. I have no reason to watch this movie again. Save your money and watch it when it\u2019s on Redbox or Netflix.","true":true}
