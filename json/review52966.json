Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really enjoyable Star Wars movie that is a little long but never gets boring. The movie leads the audience to think something is going to happen and then the complete opposite happens. And this happens multiple times throughout. People who complain about how the force is used in this movie and feel it doesn't agree with their theories need to get a life. The force isn't real. Jedis aren't real. It's a movie. A really well done and enjoyable movie. I'll admit it has some flaws but I can't deny that it's amazing to watch and I will want to see it again.","true":true}
