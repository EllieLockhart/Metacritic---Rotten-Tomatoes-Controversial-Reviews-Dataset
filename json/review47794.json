Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I even begin!? Dissapointment. Not only did we not get luke but for 10 seconds in Force Awakens\\, Luke is only marginally in Last Jedi and is 1) a whiney little baby and 2) never actually trains nor is impressed or surprised by Rey's Jedi abillities nne of which are mentioned or even blinked at. the fact alone that she bested Kylo should be a big flashing bright light saying OMG this chick is special.  not even so much ass a brag from Rey \\\"oh btw Luke\\, I fought your former student and i kicked his A**\\nNone of the characters were expanded upon and we never get the answers i am certain EVERY SINGLE FAN wanted. 1) SNOKE and 2) why the hell did Moz have Luke's Light saber and 3) Rey's force abilities and connection to Luke.\\nso many expectations and hopes and dreams and they just spit in our face and pushed us down and laughed.  SO dissapointed!! IX had better  win the best picture Oscar!!","true":true}
