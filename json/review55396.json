Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke's character was utterly destroyed and then his life was thrown away.\\nSnoke: We hardly knew ya and see ya later!\\nRey and Kylo... meh.\\nFinn's character did nothing that mattered.\\nRose's character did nothing that mattered.\\nLeia's character was unconscious for most of the movie.\\nPhasma's character does almost nothing.\\nI think the cute little whatever-they-were creatures got more screen time than Phasma\\, however they too were pointless.\\nThe side trip to Space Vegas was almost meaningless.\\nThe retcon of fuel was offensive and destroys the past of the milieu.\\nThe invention of hyperspace tracking destroys the future of the milieu.\\nThe invention of the tactic of hyperspace ramming destroys the future of the milieu\\, not to mention begging the question of why not one person has ever tried this in the last several thousand years (because if they had\\, it would not be a standard tactic since it's so obviously effective)\\, further beginning the question about why it was **shown** differently in Rogue One.\\nI can't give this movie less than 1 star\\, it appears.
