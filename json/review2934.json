Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A worthy chapter in the saga\\, my family loved this film\\, it had everything you'd want in a film for adults and children\\, like most pixar films The Last Jedi ticks all the boxes - just ignore the fanboys...","true":true}
