Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi hit on all levels. The story\\, the cinematography\\, the acting\\, all were done beautifully. The film picks up where The Force Awakens left off. The movie never has a dull moment. The battles actually have importance\\, and everything you thought was going to happen\\, didn\u2019t\\, as Luke said\\, \u201cThis is not going to go the way you think.\u201d Carrie Fisher puts on a stunning performance. And the comedy\\, great\\, just like with all of the Star Wars films dating back to 1977\\, the comedic relief delivers great. And most of all. The music! John Williams once again writes a beautiful score that creates so much of the emotion in the film. A must watch!","true":true}
