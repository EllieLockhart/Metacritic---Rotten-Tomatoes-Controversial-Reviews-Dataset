Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was actually a really good movie\\, it get many of the same things right as the force awakens did and more\\, it gave me everything I wanted and more\\, The movie has its problems but it doesn\u2019t take away from the entertainment and the fun.","true":true}
