Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to see an adult Star Wars movie with real Sith villains and real Jedi heroes. Not this angsty kids who have parent issues. Also\\, Disney stop shoving your causes down our throat: PETA\\, Woman power\\, etc. Story was all over the place. Don't like how you are treating the original cast.","true":true}
