Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor pacing\\, continuity issues\\, characters introduced that don't add anything to the plot\\, overused \\\"awkward humour\\\" (Disney seems obsessed with it ever since the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie)\\, full of merchandising opportunities. Overall\\, it feels like Disney is very confused about the direction of the film.","true":true}
