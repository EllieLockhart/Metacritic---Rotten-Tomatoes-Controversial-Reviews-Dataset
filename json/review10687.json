Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some great moments but zero character decelopment for some of the biggest characters\\, nothing new here just being chased by First Order same as ESB.\\n\\nWhat happened to Luke? Very dissapointed - no training Rey? No duels with Snoke? How did he lose his nephew to the dark side? None of the questions from Force Awakens answered\\, how did use the Force with ZERO training? Luke deserved a better ending very dissapointed. \\n\\nBasically\\, the originally three movies were for nothing\\, we are right back to having a Darth Vader (Kylo Ren) and an Empire (First\\nOrder) and all of Luke's\\, Leia's and Han's sacrifices were totally for nothing...\\n\\n\\nGoing to boycott the next movie at the cinema","true":true}
