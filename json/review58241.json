Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4 of us went expecting the worst after reading a lot of the negative viewer reviews. My son 18\\, my daughter 23\\, along with my wife and myself. This is one time we all agree with the critics. Make the decision for yourself and never let a review from anyone influence seeing a movie. I almost did and I know better. As for there being to much comedy\\, there is no more in The Last Jedi than any other Star Wars film. Evidently people forget that they all have comedic moments. Rewatch the movies and see for yourself. As for Rey being capable of doing anything\\, not true. She had a few moments but I went expecting her to be kicking ass all movie after reading the reviews but didn\u2019t see it. Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, it wasn\u2019t perfect\\, but it was not a one star horrible movie in any of our opinions. My advice\\, IF\\, you read this\\, do NOT read one more review good or bad\\, just go see the movie and make your own judgement. On another note\\, I have read reviews from people who like myself\\, old enough to have seen all of the movies at the theater starting as a kid\\, who claim it ruined something so special to them. I have asked nearly 20 kids from 8 to 14 years old if they liked the new Star Wars. EVERY single one of them loved it. It\u2019s really hard to satisfy everyone.","true":true}
