Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie ruined the Star Wars saga. Completely took a dump on fans and through everything out the window that was set up in the previous movie. Also defies and ignores the first six movies of continuity. Rian Johnson seems to think he\u2019s making his own Sci-Fi movies instead of continuing a story line spread across 30 years. If you like Star Wars but haven\u2019t seen this movie\\, don\u2019t even bother. You won\u2019t miss out on anything\\, it\u2019ll just confuse you.","true":true}
