Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You really don't see where the film is headed and it is fantastic. Kept me on the edge of my seat. In an age of unoriginality and few films which are prepared to take risks\\, this is a very interesting and ambitious film full of heart.","true":true}
