Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a good movie that you can watch once. Grand vision\\, great visuals\\, some unexpected twists but fails to rise to the expectations.\\n\\n-------Spoilers begin------------\\nWhat worked:\\n1. Portrayal of Luke as an imperfect master who is weary of the dark side and has a moment of weakness that destroys a generation. Truly brilliant\\, how they took a beloved character and add a wrinkle to him that only makes you connect with him more. Mark Hamill delivered his finest Luke yet.\\n2. Goodness me\\, Adam Driver can act.\\n3. BB8 and Porgs.\\n4. Light saber fight between Rey and the Knights.\\n5. Fight between Luke and Kylo.\\n\\nWhat didn't work:\\n1. Awful pacing.\\n2. A subplot that leads to no where. What did Rose and Finn achieve in the entire movie. WTF?!\\n3. Leia should have died. There is no dramatic heft without it. Why is every Tom\\, Dick and Harry using the force now?\\n4. Except for Luke and Kylo\\, every other character is one dimensional. Boring!!!\\n5. There are Disney agenda undertones to this movie that I absolutely detest.","true":true}
