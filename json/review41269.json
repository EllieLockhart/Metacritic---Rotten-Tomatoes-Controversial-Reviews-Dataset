Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. Two years of waiting for a let down this big. If you are a fan of the original trilogy\\, or even  compliant with the prequels\\, you will be beyond shocked at how bad this movie really is. It honestly made no sense\\, with some real cringe-worthy scenes that make the prequels look like amazing movies. Star Wars was a large part of my childhood\\, and to see what has happened to it makes me sick.","true":true}
