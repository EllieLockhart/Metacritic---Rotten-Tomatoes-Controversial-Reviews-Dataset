Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a Star Wars movie. The conflict was forced\\, the comedy was childish\\, the movie was not an epic adventure that we recieved in the other Star Wars movies. This was a waste of 3 hours.","true":true}
