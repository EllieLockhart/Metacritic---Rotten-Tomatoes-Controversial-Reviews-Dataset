Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film has a genuinely intriguing heart buried in scattershot\\, tone-deaf humor\\, distractingly lazy writing\\, cheap tension\\, and a disheartening departure from the series' attention to detail and immersion. The film\\, unlike the rest in the series\\, is not an experience\\, but a clear\\, albeit still somewhat enjoyable\\, cash grab. The Last Jedi makes me very concerned for the franchise's future as it lacks the heart and magic that made me fall in love with Star Wars.","true":true}
