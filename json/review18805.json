Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a lot like Suicide Squad: fun enough as a mindless romp\\, with a lot of solid individual character\/action moments ... but the plot is a hot mess that completely fails to hold together the moment one starts thinking about it. The \\\"fleet chase\\\" scenes are simply not believable: why don't a couple of the ships in the pursuing fleet hyperjump just ahead and entrap the fleeing ships (or why aren't reinforcements called in to do the same)? Why aren't there any capital ships in orbit about Krayt to pursue\/trap\/bombard the Falcon? The incoherence just reeks of Plot-By-Committee.","true":true}
