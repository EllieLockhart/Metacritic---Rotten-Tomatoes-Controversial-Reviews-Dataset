Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Spoilers. Just my opinion. After thinking about it overnight after seeing it on opening day\\, everything makes sense. I've been around since 4-6 came out in the theaters. Millennials are FREAKING OUT over the film and how horrible they think it is. They don't understand anything about what this film portrayed. Watch the movie and really think about why things are the way that they are. There's so many parallels to the original movies and even the prequels. Some idiots just don't get it.","true":true}
