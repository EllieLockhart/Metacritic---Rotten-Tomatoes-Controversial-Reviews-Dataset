Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing the score\\, the cinematography\\, and just about everything about this movie made me smile. This movie is definitely a must see\\, and will definitely surprise you\\, which I actually think is why people aren't liking this installment as much. People were expecting snoke and Luke to do a lot more in this movie\\, but they served the bigger picture better than pleasing people immediately. They're telling a different story and letting it play out like the original trilogy wouldn't resonate well with fans. To really get away from this they needed to empower the new characters and show how powerful they can be. We weren't expecting Kyle to kill snoke and I wasn't expecting luke to appear in the way he did. This movie is very powerful in its imagery\\, story and just about everything\\, it was just missing a better light saber battle and we need to feel like the good guys aren't safe and they could die\\, because with only like 10 rebels left it's crazy that all the main characters made it to the end.","true":true}
