Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a love it or hate it kind of movie... and I love it. It wasn't what I expected but it had s lot of good. Holdo is Amazing\\, Leia is wonderful- and I loved that scene. Fight me- and Rey\\, while not how I pictured her\\, is beautiful. Some parts were a little cheesy yeah\\, but uh it's a children's\/Faily movie what do you expect? Especially since it's sci-fi. I greatly enjoyed it.","true":true}
