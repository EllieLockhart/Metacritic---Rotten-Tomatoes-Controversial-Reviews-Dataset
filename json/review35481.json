Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi felt like anything but a Starwars film - more like an unholy hybrid of Men In Black\\, Fifth Element and Harry Potter. It was littered with cringe-worthy jokes and social concepts shoe-horned into it that absolutely no one ever asked for. I left the theater feeling entirely let-down and have not watched it again since. I also don't plan to. J.J. Abrams has his work cut out for him and will have to pull something off that is nothing short of amazing if Disney is going to salvage this epic disaster of a trilogy.","true":true}
