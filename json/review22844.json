Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long\\, drawn out\\, incoherent to the plot of the movie before it and filled with meaningless plot devices in a vague attempt to create analogies between the SW universe and ours - all of which flopped. The story\\, while containing some gems\\, was simply poorly written and executed. Additionally\\, the writers & directors sacrificed their integrity through the addition of many characters with no other purpose in the story other than romance\/drama. These 1-Dimensional characters usually were either dynamic characters from the previous movie or poorly generated new personalities.","true":true}
