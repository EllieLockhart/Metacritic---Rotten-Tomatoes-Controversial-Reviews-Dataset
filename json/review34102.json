Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrific movie\\, filled with the exciting magic I expect from SW. Bold and unafraid to expand what we know\/think about our favorite characters. Among the best in the franchise\\, IMO.","true":true}
