Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a bad movie. Following on from the force awakens it just kills any plot threads and feels like it is the end. The story goes on pointless tangents to push a save the animals agenda. The characters are subverted just to shock rather than meaningfully. The humour frequently falls flat and is often out of place. Overall it was sad to see what they did to one of my favourite franchises.","true":true}
