Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sloppy screen play that played too loose with the powers of the force and lended itself to lazy writing.  Plot gaps.  Horrible handling of Luke Skywalker's character. Resistance leaders portrayed as incompetent with no control of their soldiers - can't imagine this group being a threat to anyone. Po Dameron character totally obnoxious. Difficult to watch if you care about the Star Wars story. Typical Disney \\\"sell merchandise & Park tickets first\\, worry about acting and storytelling second\\\" type of movie. So pathetic.","true":true}
