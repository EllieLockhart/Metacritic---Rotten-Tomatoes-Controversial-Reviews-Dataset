Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Must see the force awakens to understand the Last Jedi. This movie is such a beautiful journey and experience as a fan. The movie is confusing at times but it ultimately makes sense towards the end of the movie when they wrap up some of the plot. I think a lot of people are forgetting that this is movie 2 of 3 so of course there was going to be a cliff hanger.","true":true}
