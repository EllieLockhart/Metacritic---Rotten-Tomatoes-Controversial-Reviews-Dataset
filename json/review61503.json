It's nothing special\\, has a few exciting moments a few boring moments. It's more about personal preference than anything. I personally didn't like it because I prefer my enemy AI to feel at least slightly human.\rAs for the story...\rI hated it\\, as someone who has enjoyed stories that look into the human condition\\, this really saddens me. Every character's personality and characteristics get messed with so often just to fit neatly into the story the writers want to tell in the way they wanted to tell it that at some point they stopped feeling like people and just puppets. The game focuses on ethics but only with characters important to the story\\, you will shoot\\, murder\\, and kill your way through dozens of people who are probably fathers\\, mothers\\, sisters\\, and brothers but the story only cares about the one featured in a cutscene.\rOne moment your blasting your way through enemy after enemy like doomguy\\, the next moment you're Shinji from ******* Neon Genesis Evangelion.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
