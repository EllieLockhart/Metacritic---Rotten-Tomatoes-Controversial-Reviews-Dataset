Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film.  This should be Rian Johnson's last movie\\, for he has no business being anywhere in the film industry.  The film is awkwardly paced\\, chooses poorly placed\\, off-putting humor\\, has terrible acting from all involved\\, and a plot with so many holes\\, the Millennium Falcon should have no issues navigating the gaps\\, especially with the Mary Sue pilot Rey at the helm.  Speaking of; Mary Sue\\, I mean Rey\\, is offered no challenges\\, no room for growth.  She has everything handed to her on a silver platter and is in and of herself a Deus Ex Machina plot device.  The SJW themes of rich=bad\\, and hurrah purple-haired feminism only helps further sink an already listing ship.","true":true}
