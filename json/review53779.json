Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. So many pathetic white men angry that there are strong women in a movie that are not barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. So upset that white men have to share limelight with a diverse group of ppl and aliens. Sooo but  hurt that Rey n Finn may like each other spoiling those oh so pure white caveman genes. Does the film not give greed\\, cruelty and anti-science equal time?\\n   Poor little white supremacists\\, the world is so unfair to your small minded lives.","true":true}
