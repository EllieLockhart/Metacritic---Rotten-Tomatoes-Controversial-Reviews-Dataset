Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I enjoyed this movie. It did have a different feel in some ways. In other ways it truly captures the essence that is Star Wars. Star Wars was never about the big reveals or the famous people. It was about a farm boy staring off into twin suns wanting more. Wanting to be more\\, to experience more and to live more. It is the essence of a little boy picking up a broomstick and pretending to BE Luke Skywalker. This movie made me FEEL the joy of Star Wars again.","true":true}
