Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"dissapointment is what I felt watching this movie. I wasn't a big fan of the The Force Awakens\\, but at least it kept me entertained. The Last Jedi just ruined everything that I loved from Star Wars. It even seems Rian Johnson didn't watch The Force Awakens\\, didn't wan't any theory out there about the characters to be true (even if that meant to give poor and stupid answers to the characters that we wanted to know more about)\\, and decided to do what ever he pleased with SW. Lame jokes\\, lame plots\\, lame story\\, lame subplot\\, lame characters portrayal\\, and I can go on and on and on.\\nActing was fine as some of the action\\, but that doesn't make a good film\\, much less a good Star Wars film. Rouge One\\, was far superior. The Force Awakens was better. EVEN THE PREQUELS are more enjoyable than this film.\\nand Rian Johnson gets a whole new trilogy just for himself? I have a bad feeling about this.... (that phrase wasn't even in the movie!!)","true":true}
