Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall the film has some great moments\\, however too many glaring issues existed to give this a good rating.  There is only so much a person can overlook\\, and this film well exceeded that limit. The editing was poor and the plot had too many holes\/inconsistencies. The truly great moments were killed by ill times humor and poor story development.","true":true}
