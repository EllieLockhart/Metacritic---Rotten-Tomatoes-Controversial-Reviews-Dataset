Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watch \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi | Dismantling All Order\\\" on YouTube.\\n\\nA very intelligent and fact-based review of The Last Jedi which explains\\, through the analysis of symbolism\\, why Rey is purposely built as the ultimate millennial hero\\, that is\\, an almighty Mary Sue\\, and why the movie is nothing else than a Social Justice Warrior manifesto from the beginning to the end.\\n\\nAfter seeing this video\\, you will understand that Rian Johnson did not do what he did in good faith\\, but with the exact purpose of transforming a 4 billion franchise into an extremely powerful propaganda machine for Social Justice targeted at our millennial children.\\n\\nDon't let this brainwashing machine reach your children. Protect them. \\nDon't let Disney rape them.","true":true}
