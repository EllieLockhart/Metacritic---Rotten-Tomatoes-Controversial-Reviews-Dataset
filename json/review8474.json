Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got to see The Last Jedi and I must say I was very disappointed. Everything was very familiar and I was not impressed with the story and in-consistency in the plot and subplots.\\n\\nI am not going to spoil it for anyone but just saying as a die hard\\, life long Star Wars fan I was very unhappy with how they are continuing the saga and the story they are trying to tell. The issue is that the elements that we loved are getting pushed aside by some 1 dimensional characters and a ton of special effects.\\n\\nIt's about story\\, and the great thing about the original trilogy is that it was more about story because they couldn't afford fancy special affects.\\n\\nAll in all it was a good movie\\, but I wouldn't call it great and if they keep this up it will bring a slow painful death to a great legacy.","true":true}
