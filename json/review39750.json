Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a horrible film. I\u2019m not even a diehard Star Wars fan but I left the cinemas feeling angry and disappointed. Comedy was injected into serious scenes which only served to cheapen them; there were so many plot threads from TFA which got a half-assed answer; the entire plot was irrelevant and left you thinking what was the point. I\u2019m just gobsmacked with how bad this really was. I could write a better Episode 8 in 5 minutes. By far the worst Star Wars film of the saga. THE WORST... BY FAR.","true":true}
