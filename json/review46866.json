Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well to say that I was disappointed is an understatement. Nothing of consequence happened. Snoke went out with a whimper with no real reason to exist in the first place presented. Luke looked like a badass for all of 5 minutes until we found out it wasn't real. Finn should have been allowed to make a momentous sacrifice\\, instead he accomplished nothing. No rebel reinforcements\\, didn't prevent the First Order from doing anything. Yoda looked like hot garbage. The space casino\\, was cringe worthy and unnecessary. Leia force pulling herself onto the ship looked comical\\, not inspiring. I honestly cannot understand how these choices were green lit. If you do not see this movie\\, then you are not missing anything really important in the story.  The whole thing dragged while I was waiting for the payoff. Through all the bad dialogue and problems with the prequels\\, I can at least point out some pivotal moments. If you enjoy this\\, then power to you. Cinematography was at least spectacular as were the set pieces. I hope we get better in the future\\, because I think we deserve better.","true":true}
