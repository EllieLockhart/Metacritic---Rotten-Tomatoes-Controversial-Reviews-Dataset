Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't even know where to start with this. My inner child was ripped away\\, and my son came home crying\\, wanting to throw away all his star wars toys\\, because his biggest hero was a hermit who died\\, in one of the worst send offs\\, of one of the most iconic childhood heroes\\, I have ever seen. \\n\\nThis just makes me think critics are paid\\, and you can only ever trust the audience on these rating things..Leia jumped the shark floating through space. Snoke!! What the heck is that about!! Plasma who?? Tricked into thinking I was going to care about this movie. I'm not one to ever write reviews\\, or care\\, but I feel like I have to as I have an emotional stake in this. Star wars was something I grew up with as a child. There is no weight here on any character. I feel like they gave the middle finger to all the fans to make way for a new cash cow.  No wonder Mark Hamel said he hated the script\\, then of course Disney probably shut him up. 40 years of luring people into star wars with using Luke sparingly to keep em coming back\\, then to finally see him on screen just to throw him away. So much more I could say about this movie. No interest in seeing the next one.","true":true}
