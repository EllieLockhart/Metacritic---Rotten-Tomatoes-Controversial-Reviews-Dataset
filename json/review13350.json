Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it. I like that there is humour in the movie\\, and the drama\\, tension and emotions were portrayed well. Whilst some parts were predictable\\, overall I felt the movie fit in well with the rest\\, and is definitely worth seeing","true":true}
