Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the BEST Star Wars film that has been made. With Star Wars itself being about a Galaxy far far away\\, Rian Johnson knew exactly how to finish off one story without completely diminishing its roots and start fresh with a new generation of Jedi and Sith that isn't reflected on one specific person or bloodline. 5 Stars to Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi.","true":true}
