Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie director took a dump on mark hammel and they crapped over the entire series. The female lead cant act and they made the villain look like a little boy that is terrible at doing what he does and a total pussy. Everything is this movie made me cringe.","true":true}
