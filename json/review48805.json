Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst of all the movies\\, including prequels. Im a hardcore fan since birth\\, have all the memorabilia\\, tattoos etc. This is going to have to be erased from my memory and bring back Legends as canon. Awful awful.","true":true}
