Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a star wars movie it was just......off. So many wasted opportunities with luke\\, yoda\\, etc. Finns story was useless if people would have just talked to each other. I'm all for taking chances with franchises but do it if it makes sense.....nothing in this movie made sense. Like you're telling me that a master jedi has been in solitude for 30 years and has never talked to yodas force ghost before that night\\, let alone obi wan or anakin's? retarded....also too much humor. Felt more like a marvel movie than a star wars movie.","true":true}
