Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching the Rise of Skywalker it became crystal clear to me that even J.J. Abrams  saw the Last Jedi as an abomination to the Star Wars franchise.  Half of the Last Jedi was pointless.  The story line was weak with major flaws in basic logic.  Most of the characters were reduced to one-dimensional caricatures with no soul.  It basically said whatever you think about Star Wars and the force throw it out and start all over.  It was easily the most disappointing movie I have ever seen.","true":true}
