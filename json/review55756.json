Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, the movie succeeded on most counts\\, but fell short on some key dramatic points.  Much like a poor officiating performance in a sporting event can dominate the water cooler talk rather than memorable plays\\, the movie left me thinking more about the direction and handling of the content\\, rather than the content itself and its implications.  \\n\\nFirst and foremost\\, when you have such a dramatic change in a main character\\, the viewer need just as dramatic an explanation to be sold.  We did not get that in The Last Jedi\\, to its detriment.  There were some preachy themes that were not sold subtly enough to be persuasive\\, instead they just seemed overbearing.  At times the director seemed to be diverging from classic Star Wars just because he could\\, rather than in service of the story. Some scenes were ridiculous to the point that they took away some off the gravitas of an otherwise solid dramatic performance.  At times it looked like we were watching Spaceballs instead of Star Wars.  Some moments just left me puzzled - not at a mystery\\, but why a handful of scenes were shot the way they were.\\n\\nAdam Driver was the highlight of the movie.  He truly shined in an amazing\\, nuanced performance.  I enjoyed his character's portrayal much more than in The Force Awakens.  Laura Dern\\, Mark Hamill\\, and newcomer Kelley Tran also had fantastic performances.  Daisey Ridley and Oscar Isaac did well.  John Boyega\\, the highlight of The Force Awakens\\, was wasted in The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe special effects were tight\\, the critters were cute\\, the light saber scenes were well choreographed\\, and the cinematography was beautiful.  There were funny one-liners and tidbits to pay homage to classic Star Wars. The Space Battles were more gripping than The Force Awakens\\, which seemed more cartoon-like than dramatic by comparison.  The plot had some interesting twists and the direction taken in the development of the younger generation of characters was compelling.\\n\\nComing out of the movie\\, I thought it was fantastic - the best Star Wars since the original trilogy\\, and was eager to go see it again.  But over the next couple of days some of the awkward handling of the dramatic content and preachy themes kept eating away at me and made me not want to go back to the theatre.  I think a few scenes clipped here and there\\, and some more development of the main plot line and major themes would have turned it into a masterpiece.","true":true}
