Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unexpected and thrilling\\, The Last Jedi pushes the boundaries of Star Wars mythos\\, yet honors old canon in some subtle ways. Being the longest Star Wars movie ever\\, it drives through the storylines with unusual for Star Wars pace.\\nI am sick and tired of half of the Internet using this movie as punching bag.\\nI would have loved to see more of Phasma and Original trilogy characters but this story is explicitly not about them. Old canon is gone. Old actors are old. Carrie\\, as much as it saddens me\\, is gone.\\nGet over yourself. Rate this movie\\, not your expectations. Because this movie is great.","true":true}
