Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked The Force Awakens and loved Rogue One\\, but they really missed the mark with The Last Jedi. My biggest criticism is regarding the story which throws out what the Force Awakens builds to. Additionally\\, the movie throws in humor where it shouldn't be. For example\\, the start of the movie puts you in a scene that should be in all account a serious moment and then they throw a your mom joke in there that they proceed to try and do throughout the entire film. I could state many other issues that I have found in the film\\, but you might as well search YouTube as there are plenty of negative criticism on there that I fully agree with. This is a visually stunning film with a terrible story.","true":true}
