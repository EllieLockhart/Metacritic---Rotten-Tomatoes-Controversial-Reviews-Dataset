Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute shit. Crappiest Star Wars ever made.\\nEvery character is a pathethic asshole with the mind of a lumbering retard.\\nLuke Skywalker has nothing to do with the character\\, the brave and optimistic jedi master is turned into an old cunt with a shit backstory. And then he dies for no reason.\\nThey kill off snoke with another pathethic death\\nRey is still super strong\\, even without any training. And apparently her parents were nobody.\\nFinn and rose go on a mission to sabotage the resistance and ruin the movie and unfortunately they dont die. They should not be alive after ruinning everything.\\nLeia surprisingly doesnt die\\, they kill an purple haired woman who should not even exist instead.\\nTheres a bunch of annoying jokes all the time like if the movie was mocking me. And more cg than the prequels.\\nIf i were to say every thing that is wrong with this movie i'd need something like a billion pages. Listen folks: DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY IN THIS RIDICULOUS PILE OF GARBAGE.\\nIt shits on every thing star wars.\\nIt made me angry\\nIm so fuckin angry","true":true}
