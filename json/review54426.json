Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked The Force Awakens\\, so I'm not just a new-Star-Wars hater\\, but this movie is laughably bad.  There are the same bad cliches from the other movies - cute animals\\, new annoying sidekick\\, and so many characters allowing themselves to be killed in order to save the Resistance.  The pacing was both too fast and too slow.  The things I'd want to see more about (Jedi books & tree\\, the dark side focus on the island\\, how Rey and Luke try to convince each other\\, how Ben turned\\, Snoke's backstory\\, a purpose for Phasma\\, whether the New Republic has completely collapsed) are sprinted through.  And at the same time various side-stories and characters are given a LOT of time but are still not interesting.  And TFA did a good job of injecting the right amount of humor; Last Jedi went way overboard\\, it really got in the way.  Put it this way - I would definitely watch Phantom Menace again before this.","true":true}
