{"101487":121368,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, please do NOT give half-star ratings\\, give at least ONE FULL star\\, because there is rumor that half-stars will not be counted!\\n\\nApart from that\\, another reviewer already described the fan reaction to \\\"Last Jedi\\\" best: Disney\\, what would you say if someone would do things like fundamentally changing the looks and personality of Mickey Mouse\\, have Donald try to kill one of his nephews for misbehaving\\, and literally ignoring everything that people loved about those characters\\, up to the point that they are killed off without proper respect and being replaced by new ones that are totally unrealistic \/ uninspired \/ bland just for the sake of being 'diverse'?\\n\\nEXACTLY!!\\n\\nBut I would like to add one thing:\\n\\nDisney\\, WE WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU DID\\, how you ruined the greatest space opera of all time with INCOMPETENCE\\, CARELESSNESS\\, GREED and POLITICAL AGENDA.  WE WILL *ALWAYS* REMEMBER\\, whenever there is a new Disney movie\\, whenever we see a Disney toy\\, whenever we see the Disney logo anywhere\\, and WE WILL TELL OUR COLLEAGUES AND OUR FRIENDS AND OUR CHILDREN what kind of company you truly are\\, a company that gives a damn about quality as long as it just makes money\\, a company that shows the middle finger to long-time loyal fans as soon as a new generation is on the horizon.  WE WILL REMEMBER FOR ALL TIME what ugly face is truly hidden behind the always-smiling face of Mickey!  And we are MILLIONS worldwide\\, a group of customers that can not be dismissed as easily as you might have hoped!","true":true}
