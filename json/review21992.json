Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just the worst. Honestly would've rather had JarJar be a sith lord than have this. If you see it it ill ruin your opinion of star wars. No true fan would like this movie at all. Don't get me wrong\\, the effects and everything were great but thats not what counts. The plot was horrible and made no sense. Ruined all characters and threw away the morals of the Jedi and the evils of the sith. I left the theater in shock that what I had just seen\\, it seemed like someone who had never seen star wars and who didn't understand it made this movie\\, still can't believe this is a star wars. And why change directors? It just sucked and I really hope this gets better I probably wont be watching the new star wars' after this point of they all suck.","true":true}
