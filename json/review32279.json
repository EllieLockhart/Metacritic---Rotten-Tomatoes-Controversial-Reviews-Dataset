Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans should be Star Wars fans!!!  It is too easy to criticize a movie online vs. posting something positive.  This movie was awesome!  People have wasted countless hrs and months speculating about Snoke or who Rey's parents are\\, etc. since Force Awakens came out.  Just because it wasn't what you expected or wanted\\, that gives you the right to say this movie was horrible?  It doesn't.  Enjoy the fact that a movie is just that\\, a movie.  Star Wars is meant to entertain and allow us to escape for a 2 hrs and enjoy seeing our favorite characters on screen.  Just because they didn't behave or act or revel something you wanted doesn't make it bad.  If you didn't like the movie stop wasting your time bad mouthing the movie and stop watching Star Wars.","true":true}
