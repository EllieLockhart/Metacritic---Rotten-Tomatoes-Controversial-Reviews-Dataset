That's a built in excuse for your failure as writers. The settings were excellent. But the story was not good. Gameplay was not progressive. LOU is one of my favorite games ever. LOU2 is one of the worst games ever. The difference is one was well written and one was badly written. Propaganda and reversing expectations don't work in storytelling. Storytelling is organic. Writing to prove a point disrupts the organic nature of storytelling. Character motivations are destroyed. The pleasure from the first game is destroyed. The reality is the gameplay in these types of games is fun only when it meshes with story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
