Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well made\\, well thought out Star Wars. It may have some flaws\\, but the minimal amount of negatives are far out weighed by the vast amount of positives. Highly recommended to any movie fan.","true":true}
