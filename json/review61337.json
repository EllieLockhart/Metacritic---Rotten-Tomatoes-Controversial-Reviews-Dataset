We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I loved the first game\\, but surprisingly I might love this one even more. I felt so many emotions while playing and loved the relationships shown between Ellie\/Dina and Ellie\/Joel and how they developed. The gameplay was polished and fun\\, with cool animations and satisfying sound design. The settings were also diverse and you can really optimize what kind of challenge you want when playing. The story was suspenseful and bittersweet.  However\\, if I\u2019m going to nitpick the story did have some holes. Off the top of my head I can think of a few\\, such as why weren\u2019t Joel and Tommy more cautious around Abby and her friends? They\u2019ve lived a long time in a post-apocalyptic world and have wronged many\\, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be so open to share personal info. Also\\, I can understand how Tommy would turn spiteful in the end of the game\\, but if felt sudden and out of nowhere. It felt out of character to be that harsh towards Ellie. Maybe if we saw more development with Tommy and his anger towards Joel\u2019s death it wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Overall though I have very few gripes with the game and consider it a work of art. Just because the story didn\u2019t always go the way I wanted to doesn\u2019t make it a bad game. Although I still feel resentment towards Abby and will defend Joel for his actions\\, I was relieved that Ellie spared Abby in the end. Not for Abby\u2019s sake\\, but for Ellie\u2019s.  She found her peace with Joel and realized she didn\u2019t have to kill Abby to do it. The fight at the end showed how exhausting holding on to the pain and anger was\\, when neither of them truly wanted to continue. Ok that\u2019s my rambling for today. Great game. Highly recommend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
