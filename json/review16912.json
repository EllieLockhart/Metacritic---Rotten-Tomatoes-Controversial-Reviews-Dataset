Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In what universe did the critics see The Last Jedi? The movie I saw was horrible. It was a slap in the face to the fans. It was nothing but \\\"gotcha\\\" moments\\, bad humor\\, miscast actors and actors that just can't act\\, pointless characters\\, irrelevant scenes\\, and a huge letdown of an ending.   I would love to ask the director if he had even seen Star Wars before making this.  Go see it for yourself but you've been warned. Oh...and the name of the movie isn't even accurate.","true":true}
