Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone already knows what to expectwhen coming onto TLJ rotten tomatoes audience score. Many have already pretty much summed up everything wrong about this movie. However\\, despite this\\, it still very unfair that Disney decided to add politics and social agendas into a fantacy world where women were never opressed in the first place and even if they were\\, they would rise up and show their usefulness. Rey is a Mary Sue (look up the definition and even videos proving she is one) and therefore has no flaws. The only flaw I can think of is that she is too overconfident and too good at everything. No one has mentioned this but in my opinion\\, Rey can't be a jedi. All you have to do is look at her expression\\, her face\\, her anger\\, her fury. She uses her emotions in battle\\, just like Anakin who used his emotions countless times just like Rey. But she won't be a sith because Disney won't do that. I would love to see a reversal of roles in episode 9. Rey becomes a sith while Kylo restores peace and security to the galaxy but under the first order.","true":true}
