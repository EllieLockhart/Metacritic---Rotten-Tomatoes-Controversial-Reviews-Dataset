Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"40 years of Star Wars down the drain. Luke Skywalker's character was ruined\\, massive plot holes and it's boring and fails to build upon the mysteries of the previous films. This was the first SW film I only saw once in theaters...until I completely skipped Solo because as a life long fan who's read every book I don't care anymore.","true":true}
