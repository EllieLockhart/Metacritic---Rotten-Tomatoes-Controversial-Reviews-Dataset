Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fabulous and unique Star Wars film that explores the idea of the force in new ways. It confronts morally grey issues in the Star Wars universe and subverts the fans expectations to create a memorable experience for viewers.","true":true}
