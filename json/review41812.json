Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is SO BAD. It has officially ruined Star Wars for me. I'm done. No more. Half SJW\/Ghostbusters political agenda BS and half canon breaking garbage. The critics are horrible and most of the positive reviews are from Disney bots.. The ONE fight scene was good but poor reasons as to why\\, two chuckles and an almost good space battle ruined by the CONSTANT Disney\/marvel awkward humor mill. That's It.. This makes Awakens which was bad look like the greatest movie ever. This makes the prequels look like an epic adventure of all time. This makes the Hangovers seem like a deep soul searching franchise. This makes Pok\u00e9mon seem heroic.. If I could vote zero or better yet negative stars ohh you betcha.. One inch from just pure garbage.","true":true}
