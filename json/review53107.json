Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At no time did i find myself find myself feeling excited about anything I was seeing during this film and only three times I found myself vaguely interested in what I was watching. It\u2019s a dull movie\\, contrived\\, and ordinary which took no risks and pushed no boundaries. It was as interesting and exciting as a reading of an unabridged dictionary while drinking warm salt water. Luke and Rey? Okay\\, that was somewhat interesting in a Remo Williams kind of way. Rey and Kylo? Sure\\, I bought a little of that. Fin and what\u2019s-her-name? Go get some popcorn because that whole thing\\, how it\u2019s constructed\\, is boring and cliche. It could have been cut in half and had the same effect. The \u201cchase\u201d was as exciting and riveting as a drag race for dump trucks. The movie wasted a lot of opportunities for something special and they (Disney\\, et al.) chose to shoot for the boring\\, ordinary middle. It\u2019s the story\\, stupid. If the story is dull and the characters disinteresting\\, you\u2019ve got nothing that will be remembered in the long term. But\\, hey\\, I actually didn\u2019t mind the porgs and the actors all did fine work in this sub-par action film. They did what they could with what they had. ","true":true}
