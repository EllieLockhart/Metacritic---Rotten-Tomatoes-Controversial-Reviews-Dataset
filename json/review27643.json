Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pacing was off\\, themes were nearly incoherent. Character development was average to below average and most of the movie was spent wondering why I felt so disappointed. While certainly not as bad as the prequels this definitely comes up short of my already mediocre expectations of the newest trilogy following the force awakens. Now not everything about this movie was awful\\, there were some seriously beautifully shot scenes\\, and the action in this movie is great. However\\, this movie will clearly go down as a below average film and frankly just dissapointing.","true":true}
