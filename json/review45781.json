Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very mixed feelings on this movie...there's some great stuff in it but I can't get past the litany of questions set up in TFA that were left unanswered\\, the long running time (most the middle isn't necessary)\\, and the elements that just take you out of the movie.  There's too much modern day vernacular used that will not hold up 20 years from now (the first 5 minutes is a prime example).  The original trilogy was timeless and didn't rely on the catch phrases of the time\\, and that's why it was so good.  It's supposed to be a universe than can exist anywhere\/anytime.","true":true}
