Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible\\, I'd love for any serious critic to explain how this movie is certified fresh. Without delving into any Star Wars lore or giving anything away\\, there is NO character development\\, the plot is very weak\\, numerous plot holes and none of the twists or plot surprises we were promised. I have read critic reviews talking about plot twists\\, someone please point out any plot twist from the movie.\\n\\nA case of the \\\"Emperors New Clothes\\\"\\, Disney would have you believe the low audience score is a result of a small number of disgruntled hardcore fans\\, however this is truly a bad movie in every sense of the word.","true":true}
