Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While different and usually subverts expectations\\, the movie seems indifferent to the lore of not the other trilogies but the film right before it. The cast is well done and the dynamic between Rey & Kylo is great\\, it is not enough to overcome the faulty logic in narrative and tone shifts in a majority of scenes. Good but not great for star wars","true":true}
