Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not worth of the Star Wars name. I thought I didn't like The Force Awakens\\, but man that rehash looks like a golden goddess compared to the trash that is The Last Jedi. The first movie I've ever attempted to get up and leave during. Unless Disney bows to the petition and removes this terrible travesty from Canon\\, they will have ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
