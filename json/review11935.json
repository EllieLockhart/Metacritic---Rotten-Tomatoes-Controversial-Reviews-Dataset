Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely disappointing. Subverts all expectations set up by The Force Awakens in the worst possible ways. Poorly developed characters. Pointless subplots. Incomprehensible character motivations. This film treats classic characters from the original trilogy with no respect whatsoever. This waste of time is a great example of how NOT to make a film. Visuals are pretty\\, though.","true":true}
