Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"****SPOILERS****\\nMovie sucks bad!\\nMagic princess leia\\,\\nonly star wars saga movie with no lightsaber duel\\,\\nsnoke and his arc is killed off way to quickly\\,\\nstar wars is now in the comedy genre\\,\\nand luke has been turned into a coward and potential murder and does a cheezy matrix move and at one point has a stick fight with rey\\, which he loses. \\nThere is lightsaber combat\\, but no light saber duel which has been a defining feature of every saga movie since the first. This movie was so bad it literally makes me appreciate the prequels\\, which I'm going to give 5 stars to each one after I get done here... including episode one. I went into this film with no expectations but this movie was that bad and treats its lore like crap.","true":true}
