{"101487":99031,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actually\\, it's 4 stars for the visuals (Crait was especially gorgeous) but the movie is a -3 star so there you go\\, 1 star. I find it really funny how the media and critics are blaming the low audience score for this trash movie on bots and the alt right\\, because how could they be wrong\\, right? It must be an attack and not how the fans really feel! How egotistical! Those that are blaming the alt right not being able to accept diversity...nope\\, I'm Asian\\, for crying out loud. And while I am really happy to see strong Asian characters like Chirrut Imwe and Baze Malbus\\, when the Asian actors are reduced to mere tokens\\, then I'd rather you don't thank you very much. It's patronising. And while Kelly sounds like a great person in real life\\, her character of Rose is pointless (one of many in this movie). As for having strong female figures\\, I'm down for that too! Jyn Erso was a strong female character on her own strength\\, without having to make her male companions utter idiots so that the ladies look good in comparison. Unlike this movie\\, where all the male characters are either incompetent or idiots. The blatant disregard for established Star Wars lore is quite simply shocking (and no that does not make it edgy or revolutionary). I don't really want to go on and on anymore\\, as I'm sure all the other reviews here have already pointed out what I feel is so wrong about TLJ...the forced Marvel-ish humour\\, the pointless subplots and characters\\, pissing on everything JJ has set up in TFA\\, pissing on the legacy of Luke Skywalker\\, Leia can fly thru space! Disney and Rian's claim that this movie is to erase the old so the new can grow is bullshit\\, you can give the old guards a respectful send off and then bring in the new\\, you can bring in new fans without having to piss off the loyal oldtime fans. It's not either or\\, you know? Besides\\, in their haste to erase the old\\, I don't see them rushing to blow up the Millenium Falcon. Because\\, you know\\, the Falcon can still sell toys and oh look! Disney has a new theme park coming with...gasp...a Millenium Falcon in it! Horrible horrible movie...I can only pray JJ can salvage something out of this wreck. And if Rian gets to go through with that new trilogy\\, then Star Wars for me ended at Rogue One (which was a great movie!)","true":true}
