Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a huge let down from start to finish.  From a person who grew up with Star Wars...born in 1971...This movie made me give up caring about Star Wars.  I will not go see or spend my money on the next Star Wars movies.   Some reasons for this movie being that bad...\\nNo answers to who's who\\, powers not explained.\\nVery poor story writing\\, many stupid scenes...example being Luke milking a monster and drinking it's titty milk\\, pathetic.\\nVery lazy special affects... backgrounds very generic\\, very unrealistic physics\\, final battle perfect example of this movies pure laziness.\\nThere are so many reasons I completely hate this movie.  If they just want a annual cash grab...I'll keep my money and I advise you to do the same.","true":true}
