Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had the ingredients to be one of the best. But somehow the director managed to screw up everything other than the quality of the visual effects and sound. After seeing this film I felt as though a close friend had died in a violent and unexpected way. The damage cannot be undone. How this terrible movie reaches back in time and manages to vomit all over the original trilogy is actually an amazing achievement. Completely heartbreaking.","true":true}
