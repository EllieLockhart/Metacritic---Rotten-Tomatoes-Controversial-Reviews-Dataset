Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am an alt-right activist\\, white supremacist\\, male chauvinist\\, and I'm proud to say I have voted for Trump.\\nI want to thank Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson for showing us how dumb and incompetent women are. Admiral Holdo is a perfect example of the ineptitude of women in power. Her unexplainable decision of not telling anyone (especially men) her plans\\, caused the unnecessary and avoidable death of 95% of the resistance and the annihilation of the fleet.\\nI also think that Rian Johnson hinted to her being an admiral only because she is the secret lesbian lover of her majesty Princes Leia.\\nProof being that Holdo decided to sacrifice herself only when all resistance ships but one\\, the one with Princess Leia on board\\, had been destroyed. Pretty clear\\, isn't it? Homosexuals are even worse than women!\\nThe other women in the movie are portrait as inexplicably and undeservedly strong (which is pathetic\\, given that real women are good for nothing\\, except for bearing children or cooking\\, and for sex) or so stupid that they free some animals\\, which will be recaptured the day after\\, and they don't even care to free the enslaved children. \\nI really love how correctly women have been portrayed in this movie: stupid\\, mean\\, selfish\\, incompetent\\, arrogant\\, violent (Leia slaps Poe)\\, irrational\\, in other words\\, pathetic excuses for human beings. \\nJust as they are in the real world!\\nI couldn't do better. Good job\\, Rian. You really are one of us. Respect!\\nThe black tool\\, Finn\\, is reduced to what black people deserve\\, that is comedy relief\\, and he also gets sexually assaulted by that ugly fatty stupid Asian bitch\\, and he likes it! Their sons will surely be stupid like them\\, uglier than them\\, and they will surely vote for a black tool or a dumb corrupt woman like Hillary.\\nI think that we\\, as Trump supporters\\, could not have done a better job. \\nI think that\\, watching this movie a lot of people will start supporting our great President and maybe they will help us reelect him for the second mandate.\\nPlease J.J. Abrams\\, follow Rian's example and give us another movie like this one\\, where women and colored people are depicted as they really are: stupid\\, violent\\, arrogant and undeservedly powerful in this once great Country.\\nGo Rian Johnson! Go Kathleen Kennedy!\\nMake America Great Again!","true":true}
