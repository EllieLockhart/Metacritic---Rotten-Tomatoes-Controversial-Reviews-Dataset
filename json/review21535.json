Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would say Star Wars fanatics would enjoy it\\, but that doesn't even appear to be true. Episode VIII is filled with holes\\, bad jokes\\, and runs very long with very little story development. Most of the film's subplots are inconsequential in the big picture and really only involve stalling\\, the all-powerful villain is mishandled\\, and big problems seem to have simple solutions that come off as cop-outs. The only character of interest is Kylo Ren\\, and in the end\\, even his story doesn't go anywhere. Not a particularly fun or interesting watch.","true":true}
