Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn\u2019t live up to the hype of the critics\\, but I still enjoyed it greatly. Non stop action with a few twists. Just a little too long with some of the side stories. Acting was also so so. ","true":true}
