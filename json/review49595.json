Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, should not of read the audience reviews.  So much hate.  I loved the movie.  Was it perfect? No\\, nothing is.  But if you go into the movie without \\\"knowing\\\" what would make it the best movie ever\\, it is a delightful addition to the cannon.  So Snoke wasn't who you wanted him to be\\, so Luke is not the Jedi you expected.  \\\"This (movie) is not going to go the way you think\\\" and that's perfectly all right with me","true":true}
