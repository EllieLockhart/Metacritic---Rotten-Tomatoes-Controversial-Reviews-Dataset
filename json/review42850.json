Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was pathetic in nearly every way conceivable.  It was wasteful\\, boring\\, and unintelligent.  I have enjoyed these movies for as long as I can remember and this one ripped the heart clean out of the franchise.  I understand that they are trying to somehow make this magnificently successful series more appealing to the younger generation but they even failed at that.  Goodness\\, it was one of the most unpleasant theater experiences I have had in a while.  Afte the AMAZING job with TFA\\, and the mediocrity that was Rogue 1\\, I really hoped for more...but alas\\, all good things must come to an end.","true":true}
