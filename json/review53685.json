Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a storytelling perspective\\, this movie is terrible\\, because it so hugely ignores Force Awakens in telling a story. It's completely unsatisfying as a story. Hated Force Awakens for its unoriginality\\, hated Last Jedi for too much originality. Tell a coherent\\, original story from film to film!","true":true}
