Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets one star for looking gorgeous\\, that is star wars and the cinematography is amazing\\, lighting amazing and the sets are amazing.\\nThe film was hot garbage\\, that's not Luke Skywalker is it? The guy that climbed into a Xwing and proclaimed he could take on the entire empire Luke? No can't be this guy ran away albecusse he can't just go out their and take them on with his lazer sword. And what's with him throw the lightssabre\\, one of few items the jedi can posses and not only posses they are attuned to. This light sabre is especially special as it belonged to his father","true":true}
