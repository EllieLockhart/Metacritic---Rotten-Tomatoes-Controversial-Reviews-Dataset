Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liberal undertones are scattered everywhere in the film that is\\, like the whole franchise states\\, in a galaxy far far away. Im sure in a galaxy far far away people are above inserting their own political agendas into a movie. Not mention this is a fictional galaxy\\, trying to implement todays liberal ideologies onto it. Its pathetic. And needs no place in this once amazing universe. Disney has destroyed the franchise and im ecstatic at the fact that SOLO done only 83 million at the box office. Absolutley terrible yet terrific. Take a pass on this film if you dont want todays minority represented as majority politics forced onto you.","true":true}
