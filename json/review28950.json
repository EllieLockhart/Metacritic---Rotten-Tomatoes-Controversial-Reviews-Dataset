Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointing. This film felt more like a Star Wars Parody skit on SNL than anything else. Everything that was built up and was good about TFA was torn down in TLJ. I really hope they  make drastic changes to the direction in the series before the last installment.","true":true}
