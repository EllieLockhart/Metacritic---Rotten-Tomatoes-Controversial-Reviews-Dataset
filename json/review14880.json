Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly have no clue where to start on this film. It is pure garbage. I cannot even write a lengthy response to my review because i am still lost in the amount of trash my mind is swimming in.\\n\\nPathetic.... absolutely pathetic. The amount of disrespect they did to the characters makes you want to vomit in disgust!! \\n\\nFlying princess Leia after getting exploded INTO SPACE.... SERIUOSLY!!?!?!?!\\n\\nWHY IN THE WORLD are you trying to even find Luke Skywalker!! Just have Leia fight Snoke or Kylo Ren! I mean she got BLOWN UP!! and survived !! SO WHO NEEDS LUKE!! YOU GOT FREAKING FLYING PRINCESS LEIA!!\\n\\nUnbelievable !!","true":true}
