Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not perfect but it was the one film that carried the spirit of Star Wars most in the new trilogy. These movies have always been about hope and TLJ reinforces that feeling many times over. It's refreshing to see such complex and relatable characters in a setting that we love\\, but forging their own paths. Rey is a beautifully crafted character\\, made even more so by her constant struggle between the light and the dark\\, her struggle to define who is right and who is wrong\\, and her struggle against\/with Kylo\/Ben\\, even as she tries to find her place in the Skywalker story. What's more\\, her lack of a familial legacy in this universe made her that much more of a hero that we wanted to support. Additionally\\, the evolution of Kylo\/Ben from start to finish of this film was so well crafted and evoked such emotion through the performance alone. Rian Johnson really gave us something to hope and look forward to with these characters.","true":true}
