Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is what a Star Wars sequel is meant to be. The new and the old blended together in a fun suspenseful action filled spectacle. Wisdom from the Jedi\\, surreal moments\\, poignant moments\\, exciting fights and jaw dropping space battles. \\nForget anyof your preconceived fan conspiracie theories and enjoy this spectacular piece of film making.","true":true}
