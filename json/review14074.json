Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're an original Star Wars fan\\, like I am\\, you know that there's pretty tough criteria for a good Star Wars movie. Does this pass? 100%! I'd say... I might even like it more than Empire Strikes Back. The Adam Driver scenes are always so dramatic and fitting! The awkwardness really somehow adds to the plot.","true":true}
