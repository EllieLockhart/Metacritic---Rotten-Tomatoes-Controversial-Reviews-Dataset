Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't get the \u201ecritics\\\" opinion of how great the film is. It is pretty bad. The biggest flaw in my opinion is that they broke the concept of hyperspace by doing this kamikaze thing. Visually the film was okay.","true":true}
