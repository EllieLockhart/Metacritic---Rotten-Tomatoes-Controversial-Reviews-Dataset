Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A short summary of the film is Rey meets Luke\\, nothing happens\\, space chase\\, useless casino scene\\, Kylo Ren turns into a whiny crybaby\\, nothing happens\\, they kill off a beloved character for no reason other than to enforce the female lead\\, end. Honestly\\, this isn't the worst Star Wars film\\, but it's down there with the trash. Boring\\, bland\\, generic\\, and clich\u00e9.","true":true}
