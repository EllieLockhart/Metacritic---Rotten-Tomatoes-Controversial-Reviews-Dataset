Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of the box and not your average Star Wars film which makes the visuals stunning and the story unique to the world. It's unfortunate there are a subset of loud disappointed fans who both don't want it to be the ESB while being upset it's not ESB. If you take away the preconceived notions of what you thought TLJ should be\\, you'll walk away with a new understanding of leaving the past behind and accepting the gray of the world around you.","true":true}
