Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars Movie I have ever seen\\, Rian Johnson tried to ruin the franchise and he definitely ruined this trilogy. Just absolute garbage with plot holes and a terribly written line of characters\\, avoid at all costs if you love star wars.","true":true}
