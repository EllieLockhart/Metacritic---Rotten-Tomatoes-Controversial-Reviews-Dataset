Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I wish there was a word above \\\"masterpiece\\\" to describe what this game is. This game goes beyond anything I've ever played to deliver a beautiful\\, BRUTAL\\, immensely emotional experience that grips you tightly and doesn't let you go until the credits start rolling. Being a HUGE TLOU fan\\, I knew that ND would deliver\\, and they did that...and so much more. I felt uncomfortable\\, i felt sad\\, i was angry\\, i was heartbroken\\, it made me more emotional than anything ever has\\, and I'm still recovering. The game was genius\\, and Ashley's acting as Ellie is top-notch\\, and really grabs at your heartstrings\\, or makes you shiver in fear( whatever her mood at that moment)The story is truly amazing\\, and complex\\, and it makes you think...A person can be a Hero to someone- but be a Villain to someone else. I love that the game touched on that- especially with the addition of the trading cards to push that notion. I'm saddened to find out that a lot of TLOU fans aren't able to really look at the bigger meaning of the plot\\, or understand the immaculate storytelling this game has to offer. I thought they'd be more complex than that. But a game that pushes the envelope like this one does is bound to upset a lot of dense people. It comes with the territory. Another 10\/10 and GOTY in my book. Well done\\, ND\\, well done.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
