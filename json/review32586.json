Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a cinematic failure in nearly every measurable quantification.\\n\\nThe characterization is completely illogical and contradictory\\, as well as inconsistent with pre-established character norms. The overall narrative drags and sacrifices coherent plot progression for hamfisted \\\"subversion of expectations\\\"\\, and blows massive holes in established canon purely for ill-advised spectacle.\\n\\nThe movie even forces Avengers-style gags that have a beloved place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but have no rational place anywhere near a Star Wars film. \\n\\nRian Johnson has taken everything about Star Wars that made it special and thrown it out the window. This film is empirically awful and falls apart under any scrutiny\\, makes no sense on its own\\, and certainly is a mess in relation to the previous and following films.\\n\\nOne of the worst films ever made.","true":true}
