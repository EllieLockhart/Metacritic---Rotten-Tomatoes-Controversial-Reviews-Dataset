Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this weren't a Star Wars film\\, and a standalone action sci-fi then it would be absolutely fine as a movie for children or pre-teens\\, and a decent choice for a Saturday matinee.\\n\\nHowever\\, it's pitching to a wider audience than that. And so\\, I'd have to say that this is terrible. Major plot-holes within the film itself\\, and a complete disregard from the Director of the fact that the film is placed within the middle of a trilogy. It doesn't take into account anything of what has happened before\\, and leaves no room for anything interesting to happen next.\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi is juvenile nonsense.","true":true}
