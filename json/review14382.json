Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had done the mistake of going to the cinema to see the Force Awakens. I didn't fall for that again though! Out of some interest one night I watched The Last Jedi on fast forward online. The movie is a ridiculous charade of mumbo-jumbo!\\nI'm only gonna mention 2 scenes. Leia survives outer space without any gear and returns to the spaceship better than Superman would thanks to The Force! Meanwhile Luke is doing ads for fresh milk of a huge-titted alien cow and teaches as how to fish with a 500 meters spear on a scene that was definitely part of the gag reel!\\nDraw your own conclusions...!","true":true}
