Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In some ways\\, Episode VIII was an excellent middle movie in a trilogy: It was exciting; kept me on the edge of my seat and engaged; and the plot and characters took me in directions I had not anticipated. I particularly liked Luke\u2019s wrestling with internal demons. And\\, the Rey-Kylo Ren interaction was fascinating. So\\, on one level\\, I loved the movie. (SPOILERS follow) However\\, the entire \u201cescaping rebels\u201d sub-plot had more holes than a colander. For example\\, Poe\\, who is supposedly the rebels\u2019 shining example of military leadership\\, spent most of the movie being a villain. Let\u2019s see\\, Poe disobeyed a direct order and his action resulted in all of the rebel bombers being destroyed; he authorized Finn\u2019s secret and ultimately useless side mission; and he led a mutiny. Frankly\\, I found it unbelievable that those decisions didn\u2019t get him pushed out of an airlock or at least having his credibility so damaged that no one would follow him. Also\\, the Finn-Rose segment\u2019s only purpose seemed to be so that Finn would have something to do in this movie. By the way\\, how did DJ know the rebels were escaping using cloaking technology? Neither Finn nor Rose knew that. So\\, when I think about these and some other plot problems\\, I\u2019m left being very disappointed in this movie and worried for the future. Specifically\\, will discordant\\, but exciting action now be more important than coherent\\, captivating storytelling? ","true":true}
