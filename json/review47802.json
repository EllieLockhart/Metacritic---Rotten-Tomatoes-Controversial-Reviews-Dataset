Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I start... The movie was plagued with problems: the plot\\, the writing\\, the poor choices of character development\\, the total lack of continuity with TFA\\, and so much more. How disappointing this was. I don't care to ever see a Rian Johnson move again in my life. He has ruined so much of what I liked about Star Wars. Ugh... Don't see it.","true":true}
