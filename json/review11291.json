Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HONESTLY\\, THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!!! I ADMIT IT\\, I AM A PREQUELS FAN AND I HAVE TO SAY IT THAT THE PREQUELS ARE FAR SUPREME THAN WHAT KATHLEEN KENNEDY AND RIAN JOHNSON HAVE TO OFFER IN TERMS OF VERY INTERESTING AND EXCITING STORY PLOTS\\, IMAGINATION WELL USED AT THE RIGHT PLACE\\, SAME WITH CUSTOMS\\, DESIGNS CHARACTERS AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\\, FURTHER MORE SOUNDTRACK BY JOHN WILLIAMS WHOM WAS GIVEN VERY LITTLE FREEDOM OF EXPERIEMENTING AND WRITING NEW AND EVERLAST THEMES AND MELODIES DUE TO THE MOVIES COPY OF THE ORIGINALS.\\n\\nSTAR WARS DIED WHEN GEORGE LUCAS SOLD IT TO DISNEY!","true":true}
