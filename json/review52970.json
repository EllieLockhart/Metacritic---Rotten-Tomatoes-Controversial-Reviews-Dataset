Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Arg.  Did anyone at Disney even watch the original trilogy or hell\\, even TFA?  You bring back an iconic character 30 years later like Luke Skywalker....who you teased us with in TFA...and this is all you give us?  The advancement in choreography for lightsaber duels (see the prequels) and CGI combined with Luke being a Jedi Master who helped redeem Darth Vader and you give us this crap....and then wither him away to die for no reason??  Shame on you Disney. \\n\\nAnd don't get me started on killing off Snoke without any possible explanation of who he is and where he came from?  Clearly a powerful Sith (who shouldnt exist as he looks like he's 150 years old and would have been around at the same time as Palpatine) and Johnson must have decided he didnt like him as the main villain so he just kills him off...\\n\\nAnd since when is Finn a pilot?  And what the hell was the waste off time hour in the middle of the movie sending them on this nonsense Casino mission...full of pod racing like CGI...all of which served no purpose.  \\n\\nI could go on talking about Rose\\, further plot holes\\, Rey being superman\\, etc but this movie angers me in ways I can't deal with.\\n\\nI'd take TFA\\, a re-hashing of A New Hope\\, over this movie any day.  At least that felt like Star Wars","true":true}
