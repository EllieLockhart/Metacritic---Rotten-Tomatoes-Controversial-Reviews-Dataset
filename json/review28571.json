Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. Not only did this film waste our time with a useless Finn subplot; but it also did not deliver on any of the setups of the Force Awakens\\, and most devastatingly destroyed the integrity of Luke Skywalker. We waited two and a half years to find out that the legendary Luke Skywalker had become a murderous coward. BOOOOOO Rian Johnson and shame on you for ruining the legacy of the original trilogy. NOT MY STAR WARS MOVIE!","true":true}
