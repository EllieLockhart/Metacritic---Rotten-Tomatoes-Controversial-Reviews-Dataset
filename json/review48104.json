Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie is not perfect\\, I do think it is the most interesting since A New Hope\\, there're some thrilling moments\\, good humor\\, great surprises....\\n\\nI understand that a lot of people didn't like it\\, however the trailer warned us... this is not going to be the way you think... also lot of people are complaining about the unanswered questions... wer'e at the middle of the trilogy... a lot of things could happen and this uncertanty adds something more\\, actually we don't know what to expect anymore... in a good way","true":true}
