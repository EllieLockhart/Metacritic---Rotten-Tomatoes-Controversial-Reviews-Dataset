{"101487":196405,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-04","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While full of the typical space action\\, harrowing close calls\\, and one-on-one showdowns between arch rivals\\, The Last Jedi remarkably fails to respect the basic rules of coherency with the rich universe George Lucas handed over to Disney. Here we have Luke Skywalker\\, who could see the good in someone as evil as Darth Vader\\, and who faced and defeated a Sith Lord weaponless\\, is yet depicted here as someone who could not see the good in his own young and impressionable nephew\\, who attempted to kill him in a cowardly fashion\\, and refused to truly face him even at the end of the film. Luke is now practically a Sith enabler\\, someone who ran away to die and passively end the Jedi Order while Snoke and the Knights of Ren run amok; he doesn't even remain in-network with the Rebel Alliance like Obi Wan did. Luke is even said to have \\\"cut himself off\\\" from the Force\\, even while the original trilogy established that the Force is an energy field created by all living things\\, thus making such a state of being pretty incoherent. Aside from the fundamentally incoherent treatment of Luke and lack of an honorable duel between Kylo and Luke\\, there were side stories and characters who were similarly illogical and detracted from the film as a whole. Benicio del Toro's character DJ sits in a jail cell whilst having the lock-picking skills to have gotten himself out anytime before the film picks up. Fin and Rose go on a critical mission\\, unarmed\\, in pursuit of a specific code-breaker\\, yet they settle for random guy DJ. Captain Phasma is mysteriously the only trooper to ever wear blaster fire-resistant armor\\, but she apparently didn't know it herself in The Force Awakens when she surrendered to blaster-weilding rebels. Fin decides to fly headlong into a giant laser beam even though it was generally clear his attempted sacrifice in that fashion would be of no measurable benefit. Laura Dern's Admiral Holdo withholds strategy information from her soldiers thus encouraging panic and mutiny\\, and she decides to personally pilot a kamikaze attack -- rather than using autopilot or a droid pilot -- which is so poorly timed that many rebels die waiting for her to mount the defense. The Last Jedi suffers tremendously from incoherent writing\\, but it does have some memorable scenes. The reappearance of Yoda and Rey's adventure into the depths of the island Ahch-To fairly echo and even cleverly utilize characters and scenes from the original trilogy. These moments are few\\, however\\, and do not shape the course of the film enough to define and redeem it.","true":true}
