Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a fans sins I was 5 years old. I can not understand how they built the story around Reys parents and Snok\\, they flattened the excitement like a ballon \\, they managed to build excitement and killed with no answers. killed the one of the main characters and with no real build up just flat. Somebody dropped the ball. ok have no words to explain it. Not Happy. Disney should fire some one for this. ","true":true}
