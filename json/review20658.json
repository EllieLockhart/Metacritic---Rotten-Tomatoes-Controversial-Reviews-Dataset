Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen the movie twice so far. It took two viewings to really digest what the movie was trying to say\\, though admittedly with the first viewing I was caught up in the spectical of the thing. \\n\\nThis is a movie about failure. The failures of the Resistance\\, the failures of the First Order\\, the failures of Luke. Everyone in this movie has failed at one point or another\\, save for one person. I won't go into spoilers\\, but this movie really needs to been viewed in a dismal light to be understood.","true":true}
