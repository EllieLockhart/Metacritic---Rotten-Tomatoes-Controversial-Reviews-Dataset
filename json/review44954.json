Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"UGH THIS MOVIE\\, It was so boring with the Resistance running away from The First Order and that stupid Casino planet with those horses.  However the parts with Rey and Luke Skywalker were good.  So I think this movie was fine.  Everything ended fine with Luke Skywalker teleporting a ghost of himself accross the galaxy and then actually still on his island.  Everything was all going good and THEN HE DIED.  WHAT THE HECK!!!  He appeared on his island and looked like he was going to die but then he was okay and I was satisfied and THEN HE DIED FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THE STUPID DIRECTOR.","true":true}
