Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are too many negatives to list here. From the terrible script to the acting to the unnecessary scenes and\\, as a result\\, lack of character development\\, it was shocking. All they had to do was follow Rogue One's lead!\\n\\n2 stars for the visuals. Basically a bunch of things happened\\, which kept me mildly interested apart for some painfully slow scenes with poor script\\, and then the movie ended. You're left with a hollow feeling wondering how they'd managed to produce such a poor result. \\n\\nEverything that Rogue One got right\\, is everything The Last Jedi got wrong. A weak and corny version of Star Wars that should never have been released in its  current form.\\n\\nD Gleeson for worst acting in a Star Wars movie? He's definitely up there.","true":true}
