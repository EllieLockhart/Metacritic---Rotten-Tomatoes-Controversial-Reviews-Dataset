Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. Rey is the best at everything. Best pilot strongest force user best light saber duelist. With no explanation two movies in as to why. They ruined luke skywalker. Rey has defeated Kylie ten twice. Who cares about tico. Who really cares about fin. What a waste of a platform. Could have had a strong male lead character of color. Turned him into the comic relief though how typical. Didn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t have the balls to actually have a masculine male black lead. Someone for kids to look up to and someone women wanted to be with. A black Indiana Jones type lead. Someone capabale and relied upon and self suffiecnt. Just shit on all the male characters in this movie. All of them. Watch it. Allllll of them are fodder for their female counter parts. Because apparently that\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s how you write strong female characters.","true":true}
