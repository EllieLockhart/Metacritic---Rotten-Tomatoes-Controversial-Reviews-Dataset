Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty good slow chase story with heroes and cavalry coming for help. The life of mice. Luckily\\, some have the force. Great effects\\, good acting and rather funny at the beginning.","true":true}
