Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve seen the movie twice and I\u2019m so happy that I gave it a second chance. Like many on here i was disappointed the first time I saw it. I didn\u2019t think it was a bad movie just was hoping it would of gone in a different direction. I you feel this way see it a second time. You really can appreciate that the movie itself was actually quite good and the couple scenes that bothered me the first time( everything with Rose\\, Leia floating thru space) were overshadowed by all the other good parts of the movie. I plan on going again.","true":true}
