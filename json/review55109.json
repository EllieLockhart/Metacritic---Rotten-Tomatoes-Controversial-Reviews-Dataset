Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed with the way they portrayed Luke in this movie. It amounts to a character assassination.  And the way they handled Snoke's character is simply criminal --- they completely neglected to develop one of the central players in the story.  Frankly\\, DON\\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Wait for it to be available via streaming services.  This movie was barely worth the gas I spent driving to the movie theater.  Very sad!","true":true}
