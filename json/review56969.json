Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars film to date. The film has tenfold the stupidity of the Phantom Menaces Jar Jar Binks as well as the cringe worthy lines from Attack of the Clones. It manages to constantly ruin characters with excessive use of baby humor which ruins an otherwise half decent story. \\n\\nThe entire first half of the film needs a complete redo. Its unbearable. It made a joke out of two of the biggest characters of the saga- Luke and Leia. The whole Canto Bight section of the film felt completely pointless and extremely out of place in the star wars universe. \\n\\nHowever\\, the second half of the movie is  absolutely spectacular. Kylo Ren is the definite  highlight\\, and saviour of the film. It manages to deliver some unexpected and arguably very pleasing twists that I personally enjoyed very much and surprisingly make the film watchable. \\n\\nI give the film 2 and a half out of 5 stars simply because half of the film was absolutely terrible\\, and the other half was phenomenal. \\n\\nI so hope that Disney releases a sort of updated edition of the film in DVD version that removes some of the humor. Similar to how they have updated the original trilogy with extra CGI and what not.","true":true}
