Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold step forward for the Star Wars universe. Unlike any Star Wars movie\\, but totally feels at home in the saga. Characters take center stage over flashy CG set pieces and battles. Mark Hamill is a master in his role and Carrie Fisher leaves us with a fitting memory of her and her beloved Leia. So many unexpected twists and turns. A thrill ride with heart. I can totally see why he was given his own trilogy.","true":true}
