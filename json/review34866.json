Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that they feel the need to kill  the classic characters for no reason is just dumb and so uncreative! And Rian Johnson  should not be let within a 1\\,000 miles of a new star wars film! He should withdraw from any future starwars films and if he doesnt we should boycott any star wars films he involved in.","true":true}
