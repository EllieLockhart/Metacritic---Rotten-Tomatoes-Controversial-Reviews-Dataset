Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest I loved it \\, actually beleived it was going to be better than Empire 2\/3 into it\\, then it crashed into the side of the effing mountain during the last 1\/3. The bad score isnt fake\\, every one I know who saw it basically thought the same thing. After Kylo and Reys convo on the deck of Snokes burning ship it was all down hill from there. They had it and me until then. They just blew the last 1\/3 of the movie. Its like watching your favorite team in the championship game having the last shot uncontested and they brick a layup. Thats how I felt leaving the theatre. They had it. They had it in the palm of their hand and let it slip through their fingers. Sucks.","true":true}
