Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great! They piggybacked a few lines from previous movies\\, they could\u2019ve given us more insight on the history of Snoke\\, but I thought it was fun and it kept my attention. Lot of people hating so maybe my expectations were low. I\u2019d def go see it again. ","true":true}
