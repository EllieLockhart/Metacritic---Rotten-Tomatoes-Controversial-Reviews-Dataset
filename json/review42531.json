Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an absolute disaster. They took one of the greatest characters in cinema history and made him into a bitter old man. Absolutley ruined the franchise. I thought the force awakens was a really good movie and did what it needed to do to get the franchise back where it should be after the prequel disasters. This one just set it back again. Will not be seeing Solo. ","true":true}
