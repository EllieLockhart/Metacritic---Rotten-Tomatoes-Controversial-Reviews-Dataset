Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a very good and risk taking movie. It was well written and had a very diverse cast giving Oscar winning performances. It was nice to see Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia for her final portal as the character and Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker giving an equally great performance. It was all around a good movie and if you are a true Star Wars fan you will have an amazing time with this movie. I cant thank you Ryan Johnston and the casht enough for giving us such a quality film. May the force be with you all.\\nSincerely\\, Mark X Smith","true":true}
