Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never has a movie had so much oportunity that had been squandered in every way. Visual effects and action scenes try to cover up for gaping plot holes\\, zero character development\\, neglect to pre-established lore from previous installments\\, and an obvious lack of proof reading. Please learn from your mistakes\\, and DO NOT make an obvious money grab again\\, because dedicated fans can only tolerate so much and are hanging by a thread.","true":true}
