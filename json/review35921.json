Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is thoroughly enjoyable family entertainment. The story was an excellent bridge from part 1 to part 3\\, despite what insubstantial fan-critics say who\\, by the way\\, I'm thankful are not allowed to write stories that anyone will ever see.","true":true}
