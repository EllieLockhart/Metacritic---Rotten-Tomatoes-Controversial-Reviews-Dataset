Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes. Rey is still overpowered. Luke was worthless. How in hell couldn't the first order catch up with the rebels\\, they can when traveling in hyper space but regular trouble was an issue? I could go on forever.","true":true}
