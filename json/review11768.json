Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How do these filmmakers not only crap on the Lucas movies but also crap on their own new trilogy?  I greatly dislike Force Awakens and loathe this film but come on\\, how can you not even keep things straight within your own context? All the things they built up: Luke's lightsaber\\, who is Snoke\\, Rey's parentage. All thrown away. I loved the Lucas films. Say what you will\\, at least those films had a thread going through them\\, a sense consistency. These new ones\\, it seems the directors are too busy shitting on each other.","true":true}
