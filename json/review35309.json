Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The highs are extremely high\\, but the lows are some of the lowest you'll ever see in any movie\\, let alone Star Wars. The Last Jedi's biggest problem is that its ending doesn't leave you guessing or looking forward to the next installment the way The Force Awakens did.","true":true}
