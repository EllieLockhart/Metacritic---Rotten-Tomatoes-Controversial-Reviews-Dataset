Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not that good. I'm saying not that good because it is still watchable and enjoyable in some individual parts\\, but as a whole\\, the plot was completely asinine\\, the majority of the characters shallow and dull\\, the obvious copying of Episode V and VI (literally a sequence which is exactly like Episode VI when the Millennium Falcon goes to destroy the Death Star\\, except its shaded red) made it feel like a cheap knockoff rather than a fresh new movie\\, and there were so many immersion breaking parts that you don't even feel like you're watching Star Wars at all\\, but a lame rendition of Space Balls.\\n\\nIts a movie that everyone is going to watch simply because it is labeled Star Wars\\, but a large majority of the people I've spoken to who've watched it agree that its simply not up to the level we expect. I hope the series can redeem itself in the next movie though I won't be holding my breath.","true":true}
