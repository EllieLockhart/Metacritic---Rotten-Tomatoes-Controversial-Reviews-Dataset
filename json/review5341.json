Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely worth a revisit for those that dislike the movie. Having not watched the film in a year it was quite eye opening to relive it. Escaping from the internet negativity\\, you will find a very good Star Wars episode that sets the stage for the finale. Sure there are some problems but for me they are isolated moments rather than film ruining threads. I think people forget just how exciting this film is from its thrilling throne room sequence to the battleof crait. Undoubtedly though the highlight of the film is the magnificent Adam Driver as Kylo Ren\\, a top three Star Wars character in my opinion.  His arc and his scenes with Rey are Star Wars gold.\\n\\nSure there are some minor flaws\\, bu ultimately this is a very worthy addition to the saga. Pro-tip watch this with the force awakens\\, it gives the sequel trilogy a clearer sense of vision. So give it a chance you won't regret it (hopefully).","true":true}
