Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film does not deserve the name Star Wars. Everything that happens in this movie is boring and awfully written. They break rules set in the earlier movies and seem to not give a fuck about it\\, when I heard Luke call a Lightsaber a Lasersword I had enough. Everything set up in The Force Awakens by J.J. Abrams got scrapped and ended in the most awful ways\\, Captain Phasma had nothing to do at all\\,Leia's sudden force powers weren't even adressed\\, Rey's visions were forgotten\\, Rey's also seemingly the most powerful creatur in existence and Luke literally disappeard. The big fighting scene between Kylo Ren\\, Rey and the guards was awfully choreographed and even had mistakes in it. A movie that made me sad in the worst way possilbe\\, it shit all over my beloved Franchise. Luckily theres much more to Star Wars than just the films. The Force is weak with this one.","true":true}
