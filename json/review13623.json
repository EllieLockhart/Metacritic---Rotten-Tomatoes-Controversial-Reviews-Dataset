Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt very excited throughout but couldn\u2019t shake feelings of unease during certain scenes that seemed out to destroy the plot\/lore set in place by the previous film. A lot of scenes could be seen as painfully cringeworthy to witness and cause you to look around the theatre to believe if everyone else is actually seeing what you\u2019re seeing. ","true":true}
