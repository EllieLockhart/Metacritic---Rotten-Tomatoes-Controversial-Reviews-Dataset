Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As daring as Poe\\, as courageous as Finn\\, and as wise as Rey\\, this is Star Wars that gives no shits about how you think this story should go. Literally burning its own history while paying tribute to it all the same is a fine tightrope to walk\\, but Rian Johnson walks it nevertheless. And boy does he walk it in style. Quirky\\, funny\\, thoughtful\\,  emotional\\,  hell\\, even spiritual at times - it's a lot of movie to unpack\\, but the risks (mostly) pay off. We need more fearless writer\/directors like Rian Johnson\\, and I'm super psyched to see where he takes this saga next. \\n\\nStar Wars is dead. Long live Star Wars!","true":true}
