Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot. I know people want to believe bots brought down the audience score. Sorry\\, the truth is that this is a horrible movie. It has horrendous storytelling practices\\, so even if you're not a \\\"fanboy\\\"\\, if you like cohesive storytelling then this movie will bother you. You ultimately hate it more than like it. But if you're a Star Wars fan\\, then you the mythos you love will be destroyed by this film. This movie should absolutely be removed from canon. It's the worst Star Wars film and goes against its mythos so much\\, it doesn't make sense it keep it. I've never watch another Star Wars movie. I'm done. I'll also never watch another Rian Johnson movie. He's just a sour person who set out to ruin a story people loved.","true":true}
