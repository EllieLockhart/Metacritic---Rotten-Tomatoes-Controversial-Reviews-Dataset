Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just not a good film in general. Even as an avid star wars fan I was lost in so many places. Think of how confusing this film would be to someone who just has a casual interest in the films. The fact that so many things have to be explained outside of the movie just shows how poorly written this movie was. A movie should be its own self contained story\\, with outside additions being just that\\, additions. When outside sources have to be the explanation for untouched elements of the story it shows how lazy this movie is. Even being the longest star wars film in the franchise it explains the least of any movie. And don't get me started on the way that this film has butchered its legacy cast. It essentially mocks those that came before it in some of the most un-clever and disgusting ways I've seen a sequel ever do.","true":true}
