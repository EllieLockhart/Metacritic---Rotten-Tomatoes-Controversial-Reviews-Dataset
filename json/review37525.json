Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reason people hate this movie is because it decided to just ignore all of the bullshit that J.J. Abrams set up in Force Awakens\\, because they decided they had a better story to tell. It's a good movie\\, with a great message that hope and the Force have nothing to do with lineage. The biggest flaw with the movie is the whole Canto Bight sequence. It really needed some better editing\\, and some better writing in general. I understand the need to establish some relationship with Finn and Rose\\, and that's all good. But it was heavy handed \\\"Damn those 1%ers!!!!\\\" and it was painful. The movie was great when it was Rey and Luke or Rey and Kylo. The rest had its place but could've used some work. Everything from when Luke showed up at the end on was just great. Half star taken off for Rose's cheesy line after she freed the horse-thing on Canto Bight.","true":true}
