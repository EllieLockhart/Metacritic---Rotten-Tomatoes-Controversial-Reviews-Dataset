Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes and cliches that are allowed to exist while serving no dramatic effect. The force given no respect\\, not earned\\, not learned\\, not taught. Life lessons of the first trilogy thrown out the door. Female characters that caricature power and feel flat\\, like the RPG character an adolescent makes the first time. Male characters that caricature awkwardness in life\\, with none of the humour or life lessons but all of the shame. There is no lesson here that makes a better world or provides the intelligent geekdom of the world any relatable material. I miss the \\\"never tell me the odds\\\" and \\\"do or do not\\\" moments ... amazing that what felt like popcorn and a pleasure ride so many years ago now feels like wisdom when held against this travesty of our Star Wars Universe.","true":true}
