Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi provides a lot for the ever-expanding Star Wars universe to work with\\, and fleshes our characters the new trilogy is centered around\\, while also bringing in old ones in good taste. The movie does stutter due to poorly implemented jokes and uninteresting subplots\\, but is usually able to make up with great shots from director Ryan Johnson\\, and very intriguing additions to the lore","true":true}
