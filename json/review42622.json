Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was beautiful\\, but only if you turned your brain off and stared only at the visuals. The plot was inane\\, the characters uninteresting\\, and the logic mind-numbing. Mark Hamill was great but couldn't carry the movie alone\\, and even he suffered from a script that completely betrayed everything that was Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
