Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To quote Mark Hamill\\, \\\"Just cause it makes money doesn't make it a good movie.\\\"  I'm not gonna waste much more time on this\\, but Disney has done among countless others I am sure\\, 2 things. 1\\, Made sure the true foundation for Stars War success\\, its fans\\, HATED this movie\\, to try to appeal to an army of useless\\, mindless\\, SJW and commie leaning critics. And 2\\,  make the prequels AWESOME!","true":true}
