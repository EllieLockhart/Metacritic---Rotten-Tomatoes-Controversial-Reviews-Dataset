Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was tremendously painful to view.\\n\\nI wish Disney would have hired a talented director that took the responsibility of making a movie that moves the Star Wars universe in a direction\\, any direction would have been nice.\\n\\nStory was a heaping mess. boring and flat.\\n\\nThe plot was a lazy mast of parts jammed together with other parts that didn't fit\\, with duct tape holding it all together\\, leaving huge uneven gaps.\\n\\nSeems like no research was completed for character referencing which made the actors on screen appear flat\\, paper thin and strangers to their own bodies.\\n\\nWhen the story did show up\\, it squandered a lot of good solid opportunities as it laid waste to any exciting history that the past had to offer.\\n\\nAll in all\\, leaves to wonder if the guy that fell asleep behind me in the movie theater was right for doing so.","true":true}
