Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't even have words... It's like the director was including things because they seemed \\\"star warsy.\\\" Let's throw some bad jokes in\\, \\\"that's star warsy.\\\" Butchered the characters and the ideas the stood for. So disappointing it's and such a waste of time.","true":true}
