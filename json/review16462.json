Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm still trying to process this movie\\, and as a lifelong fanboy who saw A New Hope in the theater in 1977 and was hooked for life\\, this film is a worthy inclusion in the archive of the Jedi Order. I know a lot of people are already hating on this film...probably because it didn't deliver exactly what they wanted or expected. There were some things that i was really expecting\\, if not hoping for in this film\\, and many of them just didn't materialize. But I was deeply satisfied with what I saw last night. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I high fived my kids during the film. And I remembered the central themes of the OT that are the basis of this film...hope\\, sacrifice\\, love. That's what this one is about at its core. All the events in this film may not coincide with my preconceived vision of how it should go\\, but where it went is amazing. And I can't wait to see it again. The Force will be with you...always.","true":true}
