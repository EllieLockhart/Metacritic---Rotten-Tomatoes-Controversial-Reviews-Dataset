Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had low expectations and planned to launch a website devoted to how bad the porgs ruined the movie. First off\\, I thought they were actually really funny and added just a hint of humor. There were some of the funniest moments I have ever seen in this genre  - Oscar Isaac is a joy. But\\, what I loved most about this movie was the gravitas. I was simply moved as an audience member. It was truly breathtaking. Is it the best? I don't know yet. I will tell you after I have seen 200 times.","true":true}
