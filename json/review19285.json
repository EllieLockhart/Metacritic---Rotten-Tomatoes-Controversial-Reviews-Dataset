Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its not perfect but not sure about the hatred. Spoilers! The only bits I didn't like were Finn and roses side quest not the main plot line but the horse chase through the town was not needed and was very episode 1. Also don't find out who snoke is before he. gets chopped into about 4 pieces (which is an amazing scene) was still a very good film and I'm looking forward to the new trilogy that Rian Johnson is directing. 8\/10","true":true}
