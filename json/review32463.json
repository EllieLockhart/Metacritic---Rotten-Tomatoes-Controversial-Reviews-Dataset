Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars. Many questions answered. Some questions remain. A few new questions. The movie is very well done and has several surprises. Things don\u2019t always happen the way you are used to and that\u2019s a good thing!!! Ready for the next movie!! Take my money!!!!","true":true}
