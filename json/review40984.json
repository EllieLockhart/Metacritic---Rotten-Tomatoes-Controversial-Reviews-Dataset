Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie doesn't even merit 1\/2 Star\\, but it's the least I could give it without looking like I forgot to give it a star rating. I've been a Star Wars fan for 33 years\\, but this movie has officially killed the saga for me. Politics\\, animal rights\\, and child abuse commentary combined with terrible acting\\, dreadfully worthless story lines\\, and dialogue such as \\\"we won't win by fighting what we hate\\, we'll win by saving what we love\\\" make for 152 minutes of eye rolling. This movie stars Luke Skywalker playing the role of Mark Hammil\\, as well as a cast of totally forgettable supporting actors with no chemistry. Go home Star Wars\\, you're drunk. Never\\, ever let Rian Johnson near Star Wars again\\, please.","true":true}
