Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly dont understand the extreme dislike with this film. LUKE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT YOU WANT. He is old and beaten down. THAT IS THE POINT. Obi wan is not young obi when luke meets him for the first time. Why would luke be 19 year old look when rey meets him? I think the movie left more questions then answers and again i think thats the point. ITS THE MIDDLE FILM. if it answered anything i wanted i would be mad. I really feel that the fans that hate last jedi are just not being patient with the series. If you have seen any of Rian Johnson's work you'd know the dude loves mind games. The movie was very clear to me i dont get why people left so torn or confused.","true":true}
