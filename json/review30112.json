Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad to see the direction episodes VII to IX are going. It\u2019s a decent 2 movies in 1 feature. Good visual effects\\, but the storyline is so bad\\, and the acting.... well\\, you don\u2019t watch these movies with an academy award expectation\\, but they could at least try to make it more realistic. I had to watch the originals after watching this movie. I miss the Sith and the Jedi. This is just some crowd pleaser happily ever after space movie. ","true":true}
