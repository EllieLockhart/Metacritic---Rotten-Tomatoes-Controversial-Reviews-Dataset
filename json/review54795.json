Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that Disney hates Star Wars fans and they want us out of the picture. Disney and their chosen directors have tried to repeat some of the things that made the OT so liked but just as a formula and not in its essence. The reason that I give this rate is because the essence in the OT was team work\\, three main human friends with other three non human pals\\, and even a fourth diverse hero that joins their cause trough chance. Well\\, it took me a while to see Rey\\, Finn and Poe with Bb8 as the new team\\, I had to accept that we were going to share the fandom with new generations of kids and teens that needed new relatable characters that with the gender change of the main hero and the diverse character moving to the lead\\, seemed somehow as a great premise... until now\\, until TLJ. I actually don't know who hates the over 25 fans more\\, Disney or Johnson\\, thinking that we would celebrate seeing our heroes been decimated through bad writing and literally through bad choices made by the diverse characters. Whoever is proud of the role of the non-white characters in the plot knows nothing of diversity and also nothing of interesting twists\\, Lando started with treason but made that up with successful missions one after the other. How can I be more proud of him being the fourth and feeling ashamed of Finn in a more important role but doing nothing good\\, even having his intentions of being the biggest kamikaze heroe thwarted by the other diversity character\\, I didn't want him to die but come on\\, that save is pathetic and only shows that he wasn't supposed to get the girl at all. Who made this decision? Disney or Johnson? Finally\\, I'm sure they paid all the critics because they knew the anti-feminist trolls and bots were going to attack them\\, but having in the end their most fierce fans agreeing with bigots because they couldn't create an interesting enough diverse feminist story is what pisses me off the most.","true":true}
