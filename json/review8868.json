Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the first time ever I came out of a star wars movie at the theatre and had absolutely no elation at what i had just seen. There were a couple seems that I really loved in this movie but there were also WAY too many drawbacks. There was out of place comedy. I love humor in movies when it is put in using an approach that feels natural and doesn't stop the flow of the movie. These attempts at comedy did that\\, frequently. There was also an entire section of the movie that was made completely pointless by the end. Worst of all they dumped the big bad evil guy who they built up so well in the last movie and never looked back at him. He just got left in the ditch and disregarded. DIRECTLY after that there is a possibly pivotal moment in the movie that turns out to just be absolutely nothing special.\\nThis movie makes me hope they stop making Star Wars movies. I don't want to bear the pain of another like one. I say this while wearing my beloved Darth Vader Christmas sweater. It hurts to watch this happen to one of my favorite things.","true":true}
