Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I stood in line for the original Star Wars movie back in 1977. I was 7 years old and  was an instant fan. So I'm no nube when it comes to the Star Wars galaxy. I gauge a movie by my desire to see it again. I left not wanting to. Super disappointed. There are definitely fun parts to this movie but there is just so many points about this movie that just made it bad. Hard to imagine why it scored so high with the critics. Oh well\\, crossing my fingers for the last one.","true":true}
