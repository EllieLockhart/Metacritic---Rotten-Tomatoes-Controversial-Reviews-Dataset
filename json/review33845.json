Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Only AOTC was a worse star wars film. Long on action and short on storyline. Terrible character development\\, poorly executed and misplaced humor\\, too much cgi\\, and a disservice to characters from the Original trilogy. Thumbs down for Rian Johnson\\, Disney\\, and everyone associated with creating the storyline for this film. It definitely falls well short of star wars standards.","true":true}
