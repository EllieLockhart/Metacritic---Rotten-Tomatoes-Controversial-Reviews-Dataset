{"101487":108039,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad is bad...\\n\\nThe Script:  This was a poorly written script.  The opening scene was fun\\, but the rest of the movie was not well written.  The interactions\\, conflicts\\, humor... forced.   The story arch was nearly non-existent.  The secondary adventure was terrible as well.  Fire them all... Carry Fisher deserved a better last film.\\n\\nThe Acting:  You can only be as good as the material you are working with\\, and the material was bad.  One bad actor in a movie can cause me a lot of issues when trying to watch a movie and in this case there was a decent amount to go around.  The worst by far... Kelly Marie Tran... I hope she doesn't make it.  I get wanting to add an Asian American in\\, make your inclusive statement all you want\\, but please get a better actress.  I have a feeling the gunner in the bomber would have been a better choice\\, at least she delivered one believable and memorable scene.\\n\\nPolitical Statements:  It is expected that Star Wars would have a political statement and I am OK with that; as long as you don't force it in and ruin the story arch.  Stop trying to make it so obvious.\\n\\nDirecting:  Again\\, you can't deliver a quality movie with such a flawed script\\, but this Director looked over the script and approved it.  He did a horrible job and should not get another chance at putting out another movie.  \\n\\nThe movie is going to make a lot of money\\, because people love star wars as a concept.  The original movies were incredible during their time\\, but they didn't break the rules of good artistic expression in film.  This movie broke most of the rules.  Bad Script\\, Bad Acting\\, Bad Directing\\, Bad Fight Scenes\\, Bad Sub Plots.  It was just bad and I was so excited after The Force Awakens.  I guess the era of good story telling is over and the era of agenda based story telling is full upon us\\, which it was in the 70s as well\\, they were just better at it.\\n\\nThe Acting:","true":true}
