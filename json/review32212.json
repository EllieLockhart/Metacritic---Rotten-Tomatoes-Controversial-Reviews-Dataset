Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars as we (the true fans) know it\\, Is over. Forced humor\\, dropped plot lines from TFA\\, political undertones\\, Disney influence and simply redoing the story of the original trilogy. This movie was crap and did nothing besides retell a story that\u2019s been done before while answering none of the compelling questions we had after TFA.","true":true}
