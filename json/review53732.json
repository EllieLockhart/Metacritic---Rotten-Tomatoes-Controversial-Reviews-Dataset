Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good looking movie\\, but definitely not a Star Wars movie. I was so dissapointed with this I had to reflect on it for about a week afterwards just to make sure there wasn't in fact something wrong with ME. But no\\, it was the movie. Subversion just for subversion's sake\\, especially in a much loved and cherished film series\\, is a BAD idea. I hope you're happy Rian\\, you just made J.J. Abrams job harder than it needed to be. There are so many plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, and pointless writing in this film I don't know how this trilogy can recover.","true":true}
