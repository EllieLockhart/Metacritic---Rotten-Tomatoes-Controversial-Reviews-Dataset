Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something very strange is going on here. 92%? The alt-right? Some have even been saying that the movie is alright\\, it's just that as a Star Wars movie it's trash. I think the opposite case could be made\\, in that as fans we can forgive quite a lot-such as the obvious\\, WTF-type missteps is TFA. I have friends that bend over backwards to defend all sorts of Star Wars ridiculousness. I've been disappointed but have remained hopeful\\, but no more. In the face of this kind of incompetence and plain lack of common sense on practically every level\\, what's to do? Bye Star Wars! RIP","true":true}
