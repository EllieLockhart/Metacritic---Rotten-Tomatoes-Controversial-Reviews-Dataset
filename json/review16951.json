Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally love this film. Although the pacing issues are apparent\\, Luke Skywalker's arc is brilliant\\, and the movie is driven by it's theme. However this makes the messages a bit tiring and nearly feel as if they are being shoved down our throats. The characters drive the film as well though and this new trilogy is jam-packed with plenty of likeable\\, layered\\, interesting characters.","true":true}
