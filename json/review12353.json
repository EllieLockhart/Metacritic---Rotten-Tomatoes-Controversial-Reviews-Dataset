Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am very dissapointed with this movie\\, to say the least.  I came out of the theater with such a disbilief of utter crap that I just witnessed.  Terrible plot\\, terrible side plot.  Plot hole galore... in my view total disregard of The Force Awakens set up.  This movie could have been so much more.  I think Disney and Lucasfilm wasted what could've been the best Star Wars movie yet.  Star Wars does not feel the same\\, I strongly believe the glory of Star Wars will die in the near future.  The captivating and engaging feeling towards the characters its juat not there.  We will see what happens...   I dont have high hopes for the next installments\\, the emotional suspense and expectation of what will happen next is not there for me\\, not anymore.","true":true}
