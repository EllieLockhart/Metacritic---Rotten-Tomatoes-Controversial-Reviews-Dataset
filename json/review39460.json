Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film might have boon ok if it wasn't a Star Wars film\\, however it was obviously written by someone who hates Star Wars. It is an appalling middle finger to the fandom and to the very fabric of what fundamentally constituted a Star Wars property. From poorly timed jokes that made me cringe when others in the theatre laughed to the sheer audacity of the poorly written plot. It took all the potential of its characters and history and squanders them joyously as its dialog gleefully tells all the lore that came before it to literally die. The last Jedi is a painful splotch on my fandom\\, and if Rian Jhonson will be in charge of this franchise going forward a bitter end to 30+ years of my fandom. In the words of a young Luke Skywalker: What a piece of Junk.","true":true}
