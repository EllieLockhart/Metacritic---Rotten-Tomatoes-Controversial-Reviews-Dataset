Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the theater with nothing.  Was relieved that my 12 year old daughter\\, who I turned into a Star Wars geek\\, hated it as well.  I was very critical of the prequels\\, but would watch any of them before I go back into this debacle of a soulless movie.  Some were worried that it would be a rehash of Empire.  (If only it was\\, then I may have had an emotional reaction)","true":true}
