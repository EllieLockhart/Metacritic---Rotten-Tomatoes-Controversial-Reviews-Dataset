Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. I love the Star Wars franchise to bits but this film was just annoyingly bad. They wasted so many interesting plot points and it had really silly parts. This isn't a Star Wars movie. End of story.","true":true}
