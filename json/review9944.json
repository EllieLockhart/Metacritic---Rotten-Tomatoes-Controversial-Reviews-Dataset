Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great example of what millions of dollars can buy in a movie.. good reviews from \\\"critics\\\" who are so fucking out of touch with reality they probably oppose trump at the same time they take a pay check for positively reviewing a shit show like this. This was a fucking slap in the face and the lady glimpse of a dying star.... good job Disney you killed Star Wars...","true":true}
