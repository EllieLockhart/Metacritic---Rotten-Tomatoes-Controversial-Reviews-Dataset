Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can forgive the drastic departures from established Star Wars lore and characters. Solely as a film\\, this has big issues with pacing\\, tone\\, dialogue\\, and other issues that wouldn't pass in any blockbuster. No idea where the near-universal praise from critics is coming from.","true":true}
