Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Steaming pile of hot garbage. It should be called The Last Feminist. I was seriously waiting for two storm troopers to come out as gender confused and have some type of awkward sex scene followed up with an abortion. Thank you for destroying my favorite childhood movies. This will never be Star Wars for me.","true":true}
