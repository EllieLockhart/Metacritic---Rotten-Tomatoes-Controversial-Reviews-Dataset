Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While having lots of inconsistencies in terms of character choice\\, The Last Jedi is a thematically rich\\, gorgeously looking movie that takes the entire franchise to a bold and unprecedented direction. It is polarizing upon the first viewing to a lot of Star Wars fans\\, but over time I truly think people would look back at this movie with a fond memory.","true":true}
