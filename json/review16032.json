Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan.\\n\\nHere is what I dislike about The Last Jedi:\\n  - Luke was indeed the last jedi\\, Ray did not become a jedi by having little to none training at all\\n  - Luke did not read the judi books? Really\\, he sit on a lonely island and he did not find time to read the sacred jedi books?\\n  - You don't kill sith masters like Sonke by mind tricks which can be read by a non-force sensitive 10 years old kids :(\\n  - Without training\\, Luke was barely able to lift a rock or R2D2\\, Ray was able to lift a mountain!!!\\n  - there are so much more (hate the bombing scene) but I feel too irritated to write about this.","true":true}
