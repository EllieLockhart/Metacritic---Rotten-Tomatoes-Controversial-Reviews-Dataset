Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the words of Luke himself: \\\"What a piece of junk!\\\" \\nMovie should have been called \\\"Grumpy Old Jedi\\\". This did not seem like Luke. Not the fault of Mark Hamill; he did the best he possibly could have with what he was given (as did Daisy Ridley). Finn is wasted in boring\\, go-nowhere side-plot with pointless new character(s) that turns all the positive energy and good will that John Boyega's performance created in Episode VII into a giant cinematic wet fart. The less said about Poe Dameron\\, the better (although I heard he was originally supposed to have died in Episode VII - in retrospect\\, maybe that wasn't such a bad idea).\\nSome good moments (including a \\\"silent\\\" spaceship collision and a gesture of bad-ass defiance from Luke) are overwhelmed by ill-conceived scenes and character moments that should have been left on the cutting-room floor (or better yet in the first draft of the screenplay). \\nOverall: tedious and disappointing. Billions of dollars' worth of wasted potential. Years of effort and loads of talent behind and in front of the camera flushed down the crapper by people who either can't comprehend what the hard-core fans really want or don't really care. See you at Episode IX\\, fellow chumps!\\nRIP Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
