Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi curiously indulges in some of the worst traits of the Star Wars saga (awkward sub plots\\, undeveloped characters\\, unearned dramatic queues) at the same time it conscientiously - almost spitefully - labors to discredit some of the best (brave but unpolished heroes\\, the mythos of the Jedi\\, the hard-earned nobility of Luke).\\n\\n\\nPart of the problem is that this latest entry in the Star Wars realm is so preoccupied with subverting expectations and wiping the slate clean that it doesn't appear to have any other purpose. Compelling development for the new cast is scarce\\, a small number of noteworthy characters are unceremoniously dismissed with almost no dramatic weight and the handling of presumed 'Last Jedi' Luke Skywalker is so inconsistent with his established character and legacy that what should have been the return of a hero ends up being a bitterly disappointing farce.\\n\\n\\nAt best\\, The Last Jedi is a missed opportunity. To long time Star Wars fans\\, however\\, it may feel more like a cruel joke.","true":true}
