Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s like Rian Johnson doesn\u2019t even understand that this is the 8th movie in an overall story. He completely puts up a middle finger to everything that was established before regarding the rules of the force and how the characters act and he ignores the questions that were asked in VII. The plot is silly and side plot is useless. The way he has Luke portrayed is unforgivable. The movie is visually stunning and has some cool action scenes but that is about all the positives.
