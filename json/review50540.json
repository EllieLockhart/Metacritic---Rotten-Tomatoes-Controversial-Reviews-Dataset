Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1) There is still one more chapter to be told\\, so everyone claiming the finality of things need to calm down. Answers told this episode may not be the truths revealed in Ep. IX. Luke \/ Kylo's interpretations of the temple memories were an example of that.\\n2) The same people complaining about Leia's scene are the same individuals who were fine with Gandalf and the rest of the LOTR crew defying everything to survive (#RIPBoromirNed) and who are okay with Keanu Reeves being short of a deity in his films. \\n3) The movie took risks\\, and for the most part they paid off. The casino planet was dumb\\, but sometimes there are dumb things in good movies.\\n4) If you can write a better film\\, the cool thing about today's day and age: Flipping talent rises to the top. Show it or shut it.\\n5) To everyone claiming they would rather have Jar Jar back than certain scenes\\, just stop\\, quit the internet\\, and take up farming.","true":true}
