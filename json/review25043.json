Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My teenage daughter and I both hated this movie.  With an hour left to go we both just wanted it to end.  There were a couple of good set pieces.  The effects are top notch.  But the plot is such unintelligent nonsense it is painful to watch.  Yes\\, I am a life long Star Wars fan\\, and yes I created this account just to post this review.  Please\\, Disney\\, pay attention and commit to a course correction with this beloved franchise.","true":true}
