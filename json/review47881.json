Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While an excellent film on its own\\, there were too many unanswered questions and weird scene inclusions to make this film truly \\\"awesome\\\". Visually\\, however\\, it's absolutely stunning. Overall\\, still better than 2\/3 of the prequels...so there's that. It's much better upon a second viewing\\, as well.","true":true}
