Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a true die hard Starwars fan I was completely disappointed with this garbage heap of a movie.  Starwars has always been about the Skywalkers now it's about nothing the Skywalker lineage is dead and Disney seriously messed up the movie does not tell us anything about snoke the most powerful being and ren just kills him with a quick lightsaber strike.. are you serious?  Starwars is over for me and part of my childhood has been lost never will I buy a Disney product again.","true":true}
