Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Farce\\\" Awakens was a 3\/10\\, this was a 5\/10 and Rogue One was 8\/10. Still too many plots holes\\, bad writing and wasted characters for me. I say that and still like it better than Farce Awakens. That movie was just pure bad. These writers and directors are all drunk on the Disney KoolAid and can't tell a decent story.","true":true}
