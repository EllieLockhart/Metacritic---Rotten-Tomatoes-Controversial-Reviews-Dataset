Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really appalling. I was actually stunned at points\\, rolling my eyes. They found a way to make almost every event meaningless and even damage the legacy of the original trilogy. \\n\\nThere was way too much slapstick humor. Hux has become just comedic relief. Rey\\, as usual\\, is bizarrely skilled in the force for a reason still not explained. The big villain Snoke is killed easily. Luke was mishandled in the extreme and his opening scene\\, tossing the lightsaber over his shoulder\\, made almost the entire previous film the build up to the punch line of a terrible joke. That Luke would think to kill a sleeping student after spending the entire original trilogy not giving up hope on the greatest villain in the universe is absurd beyond words.\\nThe plot is scattered and hammers constantly on some bizarre message apparently targeted at kids and young people.\\n\\nEpisode 7 was god-like by comparison and this truly must be the death knell for the series. Disney will undoubtedly make money but they're hemorrhaging the integrity of the series faster than ever.","true":true}
