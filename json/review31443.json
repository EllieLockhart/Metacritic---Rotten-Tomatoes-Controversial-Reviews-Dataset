Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Someone needs to tell Disney that their brand of humors shouldn't be in every movie.. also this is very confusing : every plot JJ had set up is now trashed or safely resolved.
