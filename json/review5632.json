Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't go see for a long time due to the bad reviews. It was a good movie. I had fun and enjoyed it like I did with the original 3 way back when. Not dark enough for some I guess. For those upset by the multi-ethnic actors\\, surprise\\, that's how our global society will continue to change and look like in the future... lots of different people.","true":true}
