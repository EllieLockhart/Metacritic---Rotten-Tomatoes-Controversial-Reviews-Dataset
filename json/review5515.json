{"101487":115314,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroying the iconic character of Luke Skywalker!\\n\\nI grew up with Luke Skywalker who saved his evil father out of compassion and fought for his friends. Only a shadow of this character is left in The Last Jedi. Instead we see a grumpy and angry old man who wants our new hero Rey to leave him alone. Fine so far\\, if this changes over the course of this movie\\, but nope\\, that is the Luke&Rey dynamic in this whole movie. No emotional and personal bonding. We learn what happened between Luke and Ben (his nephew) and in this Luke entered with an ignited weapon the room of his nephew because he sensed some darkness and had for an blink of an eye the idea to kill him. Yes\\, just throw the whole original Lucas trilogy out of the window for this. I call this lazy writing to make Kylo look better and a character assassination.\\n\\nSo we can follow Rey\\, who should then be the eyes of the audience? Nope\\, she acts stupid and listens to evil Kylo\\, despite that this guy tortured her in the last movie and killed and injured her best friends. Rey also needs no training and like in the last movie\\, she just lest the force in and can do everything without training. Luke does not really train her and instead tells he why the Jedi should end and why he came to the island to die. Another big failure. Rey and Luke even fight and of course the Jedi master Luke is beaten by a not trained Rey...what a surprise.\\n\\nWe come to another big issue of this movie the slapstick Marvel humor entering Star Wars. Poe making a prank call to Hux\\, Hux ridiculed by Snoke in front of the other First Order soldiers. Then we saw some of Luke's daily life and I wish I could get the scene out of my head with Luke milking this big pace creature for green milk. We also got a scene in which Luke wants to burn the temple tree after Rey was gone\\, but cannot do it and then Yoda appears and shows him that he did not learn anything in 30 years\\, because Yoda is still the master and force lightning style burns the tree.\\n\\nWe also have some other characters in this movie like Finn and newbie Rose\\, but who cares\\, because the plot does not care and her casino planet mission was useless and failed in the end. It was only there to have them something to do. The plot of Poe and Holdo as both competitors for military leadership was again a sign of bad writing and Holdo simply telling Poe about the rescue plan would have saved us the usleless Finn&Rose mission. \\n\\nThe last appearance of Luke\\, after no one else came for rescue was another rollercoaster of bad writing\\, bad execution and simply bad directing. It starts with a nice goodbye scene between Luke&Leia and so we expect a showdown between Luke and Kylo. Yes\\, the First Order shoots everything at Luke\\, but we already wonder where did Luke get his hair cut and dyed + bis beard trimmed on the way to this final confrontation\\, but whatever. It looked exciting first\\, also when Kylo finally ignited his saber to battle Luke\\, but then we learn Luke is just a force projection. We see him meditating on his island while crating the projection....impressive\\, but wait...the next second he falls down on his meditating rock\\, crawls back and with pain in his face fades away. So Luke Skywalker dies and this was it what he achieved = nothing\\, only a handful of rebels escaped in one ship! Of course we saw wonder Rey at the end levitating rocks and helped them escaping\\, but is this enough together with broom force boy to bring me back into cinema for episode IX? Nope\\, that was it for me after over 30 years sadly!!!","true":true}
