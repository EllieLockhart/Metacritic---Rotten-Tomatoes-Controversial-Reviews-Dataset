Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I can't forgive is that JJ Abrams had created so much potential with the far superior Episode 7 and Ryan Johnson just went\\, Nah! f*** Force Awakens. In fact\\, f*** Star Wars. I'm doing MY thing!\\\"\\n\\nBtw. how is the audience rating stuck at 49% when vast majority of REAL reviews (as opposed to most of the 5 star reviews which have non-existent accounts) give it only 1 or half a star?","true":true}
