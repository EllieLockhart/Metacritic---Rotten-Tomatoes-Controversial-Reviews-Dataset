Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi employs a cheap and easy brand of Star Wars\\, disrespectful of the soulful mythology and characters of Star Wars. Whilst George Lucas' Star Wars was a timeless epic of conflicted personal emotion and familial relationships (sometimes clumsily portrayed)\\, it seems the Disney Star Wars is a visually beautiful and instantaneously gratifying feast with almost zero mythological value.","true":true}
