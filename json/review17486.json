Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see many people giving the movie hate. I feel that hate is unwarranted because something happened that they didn't like. It's hard to explain this without spoilers but I loved this movie! Some very interesting turn of events happen\\, and some great moments. Quite impressed! I honestly wish Rian would direct Episode 9 so he can continue with his ideas! I feel that JJ will try and change some of what Rian did. All in all would definitely recommend watching and soon to avoid spoilers!","true":true}
