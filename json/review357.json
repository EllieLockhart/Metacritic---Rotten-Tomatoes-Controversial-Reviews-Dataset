I think the reason I often sidelined it\\, was because I knew it was essentially interactive movie. But after playing it through and with only 3 characters surviving the journey\\, I released that the choices you made actually did impact the game a lot. it was far more interactive than I had first thought.\rThe characters\\, although mostly unlikable at the beginning\\, start to grow on you as they are tormented through the game\\, often showing a different side that you might not expect. So if they do meet a grisly end\\, you feel connected enough to actually care.\rI ended up playing it through about 3 times in the end as I wanted to do a blind run first and then go back and get all the trophies. Each time i finished the game the ending was substantially different. meaning the complexity of each tiny choice made\\, branches off in to a unique path\\, a true Butterfly Effect. so it makes you choose wisely and actually ponder as to what your decision might mean later down the line.\rGraphically this game is beautiful\\, the lighting\\, character models\\, textures and effects make for a very believable world with real character and mystery. each area looks totally unique from the next. The animations are on a whole pretty solid\\, with a few stiff moments here and there.\rThe sound and voice acting are also pretty good\\, with each character looking and sounding different enough from each other that you know who's who. my one exception to this is the character Emily\\, who soon starts to grate your ears every time she speaks.\rThe environmental sound design is also great\\, with subtle noises in the distance\\, to those big cinematic moments\\, it has a cinematic quality that adds to the tension and on screen events.\rI won't spoil the story though as it's best to go in knowing nothing. But it's definitely enjoyable and very interesting\\, with a lot of environmental storytelling too if you want to delve deeper.\rAll in all\\, i thoroughly enjoyed this game\\, although i wasn't expecting to. For anyone else who's put off playing this until now\\, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
