Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED IT!! Not spoiling:  Please read the whole thing.\\n\\nTo those that are disappointed... Sorry that you didn't get to see another Deathstar blow up.\\n\\nI had an opportunity to read some of the fan reviews that were negative and I whole heartedly disagree.  The fact that some audience members are upset because the story didn't play out to their expectations\\, or they did not get the answers they hoped for or were expecting in regard to certain characters are not grounds to refer to a film as being \\\"flawed\\\" or \\\"poorly execute.\\\"  In fact\\, it's the reverse.  Rian Johnson delivered masterful visuals\\, many of which did not rely on visual effects\\, as well as incredibly choreographed duels.  More importantly\\, he surprised us in more than one way.\\n\\nHere's what The Last Jedi finally gave us; 1) New\/Fresh takes on The Force and force sensitive characters\\, 2) New relationships and conflicts between characters that diverge from a single family drama\\, 3) Visuals that harken back to the Samurai films that inspired George Lucas to write the original film\\, 4)There is not a clear delineation between good and evil by giving us enemies that are not so different from one another\\, and actually understand each other's point of view\\, 5) Most importantly\\, character growth for both Rey and Kilo Ren- Each had a character arch that took them from being emotionally lost to a point\/level of understanding their purpose in their universe.  This allows us\\, the audience\\, to care more about Rey's and Kilo's journey than wondering \\\"Where's Luke?\\\" or \\\"When will Luke show up?\\\"\\n\\nIf you believe story telling is about telling the same tale over and over again\\, than that's own you\\, not Rian Johnson or Disney or whoever you want to blame.\\n\\nThat being said\\, the audience I watched this movie with applauded\\, laughed\\, and cheered right along with the movie.  I was beyond happy with this film and I am glad they chose to break new ground.  Thank you\\, Rian Johnson!","true":true}
