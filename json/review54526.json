Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to post here because I feel none of these reviews are getting it right - they are all either too verbose or not articulate enough.\\n\\nLet's keep it simple; here's what the movie got mostly right:\\n- The original characters. Luke\\, Leia\\, C-3PO\\, and Chewy feel and act like they should.\\n- The ambience\\, for the most part\\, is just like the original trilogy. The silly aliens and the droid humor are very remniscent to Episode's 4\\, 5 and 6. \\n- Poe Dameron (the pilot) and BB-8 have quickly become my favorite characters of this new trilogy. They are like Han and Chewy. I hope Disney makes a spinoff for those two.\\n- Mother f'n Captain Phasma is a better badguy than the badguys. Seriously. She actually intimidates me\\, unlike wannabe Vader Kylo Ren.\\n\\nNow\\, here's what the The Last Jedi got mostly wrong (note\\, a lot of this wouldn't apply to other movies\\, just the Star Wars franchise):\\n- The humor. 80% of the time it doesn't land. Period. And understand I LOVE the avengers movies\\, and while this humor is similar to those it is by far more awkward.\\n- Levity. No one in this film takes the dire situations around them seriously\\, and pile that with a mind-boggling level of incompetence from both the First Order and The Rebellion\\, I was honestly rooting for them all to die. And no joke\\, for the entire movie we watch the main Rebellion force float in space and do nothing but get their shields shot at while they run out of fuel.\\n- Snoke. No\\, just no.\\n- The main characters of this new trilogy do not grow\\, change or evolve in any fashion. Disney really dropped the ball with this one. There is literally nothing in this film that stokes a desire to see the next installment. The heroes and antagonists are just as mild and meh as they were in TFA's. And there is no plot for Episode 9 to build up on here besides The First Order and Rebellion's tug-of-war for the galaxy. No emotional strife in any form is left since it was all poorly spent in this film.\\n\\nI could go on about the good and bad\\, but I'm trying to keep this short.\\n\\nBottom line: this is a fantastic movie for adult amusement and child entertainment. If you don't take Star Wars seriously\\, you will like The Last Jedi. But if you're like me\\, you'll be left conflicted with the incredibly ambiguous direction Star Wars is starting to take. May the Force be with JJ Abrams as he tries to fix this convoluted mess.","true":true}
