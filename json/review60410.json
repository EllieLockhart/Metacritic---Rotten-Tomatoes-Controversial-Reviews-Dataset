I think the story and character development are amazing\\, if very intense. I loved Abby's character\\, and by the time the credits rolled\\, I identified and empathized with her more than I did Joel or Ellie. I couldn't believe the risks that Naughty Dog took with this game.\r\rBe warned however\\, as this is the most violent game that I have ever played and makes the first game look pretty tame by comparison. The level of violence coupled with the intense emotion and trauma makes this game NOT for the faint of heart. I'm being serious.\r\rI am docking a point from my rating for one reason: Santa Barbara. That's all I'm going to say. If that chapter was removed\\, this game would be a 10\/10 to me.\r\rStill one of the best games I have ever played.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
