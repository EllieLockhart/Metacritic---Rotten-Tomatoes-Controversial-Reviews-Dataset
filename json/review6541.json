Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does it have problems? Yes. The pacing and editing is sometimes off\\, it had some weird effects and moments. But did it surprise me? Yes\\, alot! Did I mostly enjoy it? Yes. Did it raise questions and provoke discussion. CERTAINLY YES. Definitely worth to see\\, but I also understand why someone might not like it. Lots of bold choices by Rian Johnson.","true":true}
