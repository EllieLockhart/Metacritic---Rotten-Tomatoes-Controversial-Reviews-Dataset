Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the best Star Wars movies. Sorry to those people who didn't get what they wanted with snoke (emperor had no backstory either till the prequels) or Rey (honestly\\, who were her parents supposed to be? Anakin Skywalker had nobody parents) Sorry for people who are disappointed in Luke. How is he supposed to be the same person he was 30 yrs ago? He made a mistake when he was tempted to kill his nephew\\, he was ashamed and went into hiding and cut himself off from the force. Also\\, the ending showed how powerful he was in the force and why he is one of the most powerful force users ever. The ended Luke's story fine. Overall the is one best filmed Star Wars movies (minus Canto Bight stuff which was a little over the top). Also the Leia scene looked odd but not ridiculous considering she had used the force before in a life threatening situation in the Claudia Grey novel and the Yoda wanted to train Leia\\, not Luke","true":true}
