Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sincerely one of the worst movies ever made. Rian Johnson didn't seem to understand tone or character development. The humor did not land nor should it have and the story was two and a half hours of events that lead nowhere and do nothing to further the story. I understand this new trilogy is about the new characters but they didn't have to waste the potential of the old characters and rush them out of the movie. This movie felt more like Harry Potter or the Fifth Element than Star Wars. I am all for trying new things and was looking forward to seeing something new and different but those things have to be written well and worth it. This movie was not worth it.","true":true}
