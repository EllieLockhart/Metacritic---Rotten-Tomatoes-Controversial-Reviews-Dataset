Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything to like about Star Wars has been thrown away and now we are left with SJW nonsense and Disney-esque moments. Frustrating to watch to say the least. Left the theater a little frustrated and confused about what I just witnessed.","true":true}
