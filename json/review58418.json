Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Age 13\\, the original trilogy\\, which I'd already loved\\, was re-released\\, which meant I got to obtain a vhs copy of my own\\, albeit with some shoddy expansions. I would get up at 6am each day for months to watch all or part of one of the films before school. I read the extended universe books in depth\\, and cried myself to sleep that it wasn't real. I was thoroughly obsessed with the magic of Star Wars\\, and it was a governing force for a long time. \\n\\nThe fixation faded over time\\, mostly due to life getting in the way\\, but a little to do with Lord of the Rings being such a strong competitor for my affections. But also\\, that was 20 years ago. How long can that level of intensity last?\\n\\nWell it turns out that with a sufficient reboot\\, it can totally reignite! And while I LOVED The Force Awakens\\, and Rogue One\\, it wasn't until The Last Jedi that that wonder and excitement and involvement fully returned to me. It's such a wonderful and nostalgic feeling to reconnect with!\\n\\nOnly this time\\, I see women at the fore\\, and the roles I wish child-me had been offered in heroes are all starting to be real. It's almost enough that I get to see it in my lifetime. \\n\\nThe locations\\, flora and fauna are excellent (though possibly demonstrate a subtle vegan agenda?) the new characters all add vital points to the narrative\\, little is wasted. It's a long film\\, but for me I adored every moment and didn't feel the time at all! Truly magical!","true":true}
