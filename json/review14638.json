Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have heard that watching this movie a second time is helpful for Star Wars fans. I watched all 7 star wars movies in 2017 in preparation for this film. And it just doesn't fit the rest of the Star Wars universe. It makes me uninterested in the entire future of Disney's use of the Star Wars franchise. I've seen 6 star wars movies in a row in theaters\\, and I think I'll be waiting for Solo on DVD. I hope the upcoming generation of fans enjoys the frachise as much as I used to.","true":true}
