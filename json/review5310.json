Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DEFINITELY one of my fave Episodes in the series.  Before the film was released I had come to my own conclusions about certain plot threads and how they would work out\\,  but the film subverted each expectation\\, surprising me each time. The only reason it doesn't get Five Stars is because I found one minor plot thread extraneous. Already saw it twice and can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
