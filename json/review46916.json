Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see it in theather six months ago and I was super pissed. Six months later\\, I'm more pissed than ever if I think about how all my expectations were CRUSHED. Worst Star Wars movie ever\\, the prequels were masterpieces compaired to this.","true":true}
