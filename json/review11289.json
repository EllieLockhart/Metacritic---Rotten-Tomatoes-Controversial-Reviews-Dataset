Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible addition to the Star Wars cinematic universe. This whole movie should be thrown out from canon\\, as it did nothing to advance the story line setup in the Force Awakens\\, or give the audience answers from said previous movie. Rian\\, you did not deliver a movie which fans wanted to see. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie\\, because it was that terrible.","true":true}
