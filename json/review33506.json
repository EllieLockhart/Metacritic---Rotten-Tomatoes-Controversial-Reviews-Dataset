Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible direction\\, mishandled a lot of character\\, countless plot holes\\, probably the dumbest scene in all of stars Wars yes even dumber than why Anakin hates sand. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and the more I think about this movie the more I hate it. It felt like watching the prequels again with all the terrible writing and cringy dialogue\\, this is probably the worst one in the series\\, yes worse than Attack of the Clones. It was so disappointing.","true":true}
