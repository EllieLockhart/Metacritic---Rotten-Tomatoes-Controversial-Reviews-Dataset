Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Going in\\, I was aware that critics have been busy dismissing many bad reviews as being all about a bunch of \\\"toxic fan boys\\\" and \\\"nostalgia junkies\\\" (read... the fans who watch your movie) ripping apart a film because they didn't agree with where the film went. Boy were the critics wrong!\\n\\nThough this film has some of the most spectacular effects and effective presentation of visual ideas I have seen in a Star Wars film\\, it is a total disappointment in the writing department and it comes off as a rolling series of disjointed action sequences with very little thought in character development. The film feels devoid of any attempt to stick to continuity of story line\\, established lore\\, or keeping true to the struggles\\, growth and strengths of any character that came before it\\, even the main characters of the new trilogy! Pack that in with poorly executed fight choreography where enemy knives disappear (if this was a game my controller would have hit the wall!) and nonsensical character motivations to draw them ineptly from action scene to action scene and you have a beautifully entertaining shell with no candy inside.\\n\\nThis movie is working to get us to trade in the strong story of the human struggle which we know and love for a henpecking narrative on current societal struggle. To get us to give up the intrinsic idea of basic human heroism by rebranding it as some carefully crafted narrative about \\\"the inherent iniquity of current societal norms\\\"\\, and by this\\, corroding the conviction that no one is truly evil for a fickle punch list of ideological wrongs to identify evil\\, and that facing your fears with grit and tenacity isn't as worthwhile as belittling your opposition and mocking those who engage in what you find as ideologically wrong. Though these seem to be the main lessons of today in general\\, it is inexcusable in whatever narrative it is found\\, and more sadly where there is a history of so much more subtle substance.\\n\\nWe can say whatever we want about the previous films and \\\"the subversion of expectation\\\" that somehow is supposed to redeem this heap of trash\\, but the intrinsic human struggle that the original trilogy of films spoke to our souls with is not here. This is a film that whines and bickers about surface social norms\\, not the human condition. And I frankly refuse to listen to the unending stream of insufferably matronly \\\"tisk-tisk's\\\" this movie tosses about in place of the sage and timeless bits of advice to humanity in general it's precedent movies are loved and quoted for... for over 40 years.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is either story telling at it's most sadly inept and superficial\\, sequel making at it's most wantonly destructive\\, or a premeditated dismantling of an intellectual property at it's most deplorable. But likely all three. I just can't buy the main story line at all unless Rey is the Dark Side embodied.\\n\\nThe Whiz-bang is pretty though... Good going special effect artists!","true":true}
