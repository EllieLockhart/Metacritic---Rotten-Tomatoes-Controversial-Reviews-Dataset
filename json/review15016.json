Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know it's Star Wars and I adore most of the movies with prequels being alright\\, but this one I can understand why most did not agree with. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an anticipated film I enjoyed but left with a very unsatisfied look from its story. The cast was great\\, Rey I felt was fine\\, Luke Skywalker was alright but this film just leaves us with questions that's all. The film massively of suffered from it's plot holes and subplots it gave and it did answer some questions but not quite elaborated. By far\\, the film look beautiful by it's outstanding visuals and CGI\\, the action\/battle scenes looked great and the film held a great score once again. The cinematography looked fantastic. Though there are scenes I felt were so unnecessary especially with the casino part which didn't help much. Some of the characters I felt like they weren't really there to live up at all like Rose and there are monents where it can leave so much in question. But\\, most of all\\, the film wastes it characters in such a way that I felt was terrible Jokes were sometimes landed but not much at all and the ending was not surprising at all. Overall I thought it was alright\\, it was entertaining by it's duration\\, visuals CGI was outstanding\\, action scenes were well shot and choreographed and I will only say for fans\\, the film just manages to leave with so much to question.
