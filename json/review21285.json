{"101487":147303,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with high expectations. I enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, for all its faults and retreads of old ideas\\, as it showed just how well the Star Wars world can work in today's standards. Then\\, Rogue One came along and told a story that I didn't even know I wanted. The characters were compelling\\, the designs stunning\\, and the story was something I never expected to see in a cinematic Star Wars film\\, showing just how much impact a war has. With that said\\, I was entering this wondering if my expectations were too high. Perhaps it would just be a fluke. A lot of hot air. Maybe it would get nowhere close to the precedent it set.\\n\\nI've never been so glad to be proven wrong.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi not only met my expectations\\, it surpassed them by leaps and bounds! I find myself having a difficult time deciding what to even start with. I suppose I'll start with a basic summary.\\n\\nThe film essentially follows two intertwining stories\\, the rebels attempting to escape from the First Order\\, and Rei attempting to learn the ways of the Jedi from an older Luke Skywalker. The keyword being \\\"attempting\\\"\\, as hopelessness grips both scenarios like a vice. From the opening scene\\, you get a feel for just how outmatched the rebel forces are\\, as every strong hit they give results in heavy losses for them. Not that Rei is much better\\, as Luke has sworn off the ways of the Jedi\\, and holds the belief that such ways are best left dead and buried. Through their interaction\\, we see what has led him to this point\\, through a very compelling story between the two. I could go on\\, but I wouldn't give it justice.\\n\\nWhat makes this film work so well is how nicely every element balances each other\\, and keeps your interest gauged in the world you have before you. Humor balances sadness\\, action compliments drama\\, and familiar sights meet strange and exciting new turns. One thing that I greatly feel is stronger in the new films is how much of the dialogue feels natural and fluid\\, giving you a nice\\, pure bond between you and the characters. I always felt that dialogue in the classic series was \\\"stiff and dry\\\"\\, and while I know that can be attributed to it's age and time period\\, I'm glad to see how it has evolved so naturally.\\n\\nThe sets\\, naturally\\, are exactly what you expect from Star Wars\\, from an intergalactic casino\\, to the cold interior of the starships\\, to the lush greenery of the Jedi Island. However\\, special mention goes to the mining facility\\, on a planet that is by far one of the most alien and unique locations I've ever seen on film. I won't spoil much due to its presence in the finale\\, but it makes the perfect backdrop in the battle of classic good vs. evil...\\n\\nWhich leads me to my last point\\, and what I admire most about the film: the themes! The film practically exudes hopelessness\\, almost overbearingly so\\, but it still has the aspirations for greatness at heart. You'll constantly see how sacrifice and redemption become major themes\\, but they way they go into these themes are done so in ways you would not expect. There are many times where being a hero is not the most intelligent way to go\\, and many times our main characters don't come out as the positive influence they want to be. Luke is one of the greatest showcases of this\\, as his dissatisfaction with the Jedi comes from how much one mistake can cause. I honestly have never been challenged so much in a Star Wars film\\, which frankly\\, is one of the most Black-and-White Good-vs-Evil films I can imagine.\\n\\nIt baffles me how there is so much discourse among audiences about this film. It is not \\\"The Empire Strikes Back 2.0\\\"\\, and it is not a \\\"prequel-quality sequel\\\"  either. It's something new\\, and for Star Wars\\, it's greatly needed.","true":true}
