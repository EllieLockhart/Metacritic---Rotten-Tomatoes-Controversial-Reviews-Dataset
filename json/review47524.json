Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What plot there is dissipates as the movie meanders along somewhere between a bad episode of battlestar galactica and wacky races. I am not a die hard star wars fan and I'm not bothered apart the folklore particularly but this is a horrendous miss fire as a movie on any level.\\n\\nCharacters appear almost at random and then disappear just as quickly. Then reappear. And fight. Or flee. Or both. New characters pop up with no warning do really important stuff to try to get the film out of the narrative brick wall it drove itself in to. Or a parking violation does the same thing. If there is a reference to the usual suspects buried in there\\, it matches the lameness of the film.\\n\\nI am trying to remember the script but it went 'something something jedi' pause\\, cut to planet\\, failed joke\\, something something jedi. Fight'. Almost left but gave it an extra half a star for the last twenty minutes being action packed.","true":true}
