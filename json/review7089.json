Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Emotional\\, Complex and Gripping; The Last Jedi does what no Star Wars Film in the last 30 years has been able to do\\, push the franchise forward a major leap\\, in a way that adds depth and emotional weight heading into the final chapter.","true":true}
