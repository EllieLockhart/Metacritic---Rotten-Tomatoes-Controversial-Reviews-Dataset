Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie expecting a 'dark story'. I remember reading that it 'darker then Empire'. It is not. This movie is a very light movie with few if any truly dark moments. There were too many jokes taking away from otherwise serious scenes which I felt hurt this movie overall.\\nBut this is not to say that this is a bad movie\\, just not what I expected. It is a very enjoyable if you are looking for a fun movie that can watched with all audiences. I cannot help but compare it to a marvel movie - light\\, fun and accessible to everyone but missing depth in some areas.\\nOverall I believe that some of the terrible reviews that this movie is facing are completely unwarranted. It is visually stunning and a great addition to the star wars universe. Just don't go into this expecting something like Empire.","true":true}
