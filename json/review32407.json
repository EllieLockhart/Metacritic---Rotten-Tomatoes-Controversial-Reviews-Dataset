Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is d me now. Disney killed this story!\\n\\nI feel like I was watching Sesame Street meets \\\"The View\\\"\\,meets a college student trying to complete his student film\\, just after he completed his sociology and lesbian dance theory class. It's getting old and I will no longer give this franchise my money.","true":true}
