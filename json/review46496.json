Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was very excited to see this movie.  After seeing it\\, I have lost any interest in seeing the future Disney Star Wars films.  I was excited to learn more about the cliffhangers setup in Episode VII.  I was excited to see Luke training Rey.  I was excited about Snoke's backstory and learning more about that.  Rian Johnson said screw all that.  Outright dropping those threads.  Luke Skywalker was also terribly mishandled as a character.  Honestly\\, I enjoyed the Phantom Menace more than this film.","true":true}
