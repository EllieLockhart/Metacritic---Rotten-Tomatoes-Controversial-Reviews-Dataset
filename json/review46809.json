Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, I've been saying for years that they should just let these old franchises sunset. My generation got to revel in the Star Wars phenomenon and now\\, because Hollywood-and Disney in particular-has become the home of creative cowardice\\, they just won't let these cash cow properties die gracefully. It's like putting a once great quarterback on the field at 80 with a catheter and respirator and telling him to win the Super Bowl.\\nI've read a few of Johnson's defenses about the awful decisions he made in this film and they are unconvincing. The thing is\\, he's making arguments that would make sense if we were talking about an HBO series that was supposed to defy your expectations of narrative arc and present you with nuanced themes. But this is Star Wars! It is based on the most fundamental and basic storytelling structure in the history of the world: the Hero's Journey as explained in Joseph Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces! That is the book that George Lucas based the original trilogy on. It's about how we can hear that same story over and over again and it NEVER gets boring! Gilgamesh\\, Abraham\\, Moses\\, David\\, Jesus\\, Budda\\, Beowulf\\, King Arthur\\, Katniss Everdeen\\, Luke Skywalker. It's all the same story!\\nAnd our delight is in watching that formula play out. Rey could have been awesome. Even without notable parantage\\, she could have fit the mold. It was all laid out for them! But Johnson\\, Abrams et al. screwed it up! And they did it out of a combination of ego (\\\"Hey\\, let's totally show Lucas and these old timers how we can up-end their sacrosanct legacy\\\") and greed (\\\"Let's structure this in the most noncommittal way to give us broad latitude for additional movies and spinoffs!)\\, to say nothing of the obvious socio-political agenda at work in the script.\\n\\nThe takeaway is simply that we're two films into this trilogy and I just don't care about Rey. Not because she's a woman-I also don't care about any of the male characters-but because the storytelling is weak\\, the characters are unsympathetic and the rest of the movie wants to be respected for awful and poorly timed gags.\\nAnd that would be okay\\, if only they didn't feel compelled to dismantle the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Again\\, Johnson tries to explain this away as a device for \\\"passing the torch\\\". But you can pass the torch without setting the passer on fire. Luke is not supposed to be a subject of bathos! Obi-Wan managed to communicate his sadness about Vader without being made into a circus freak. But here we see a pathetic\\, diminished Luke\\, suckling at the engorged breasts of Lovecraftian sea-cows. A telling symbol\\, but\\, again\\, I won't go there\\, mostly because\\, duh.\\n\\nIn sum\\, awful movie. But I'm sure I'll go see the next one because\\, you know\\, Star Wars.","true":true}
