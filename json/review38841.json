Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They have butchered a legacy. The story was weak and the acting was over the top in some areas and then poor in others. The Directors have not enhanced what George Lucas had mastered. Being a very big fan... I have to say this was incredibly disappointing. Some of the action scenes were great and others well.... they were messy and didn't make use of a Jedi's powers. I just hope the finally movie in 2019 doesn't leave hardcore fans with an awful taste in their mouths and has a story line that actually makes sense.","true":true}
