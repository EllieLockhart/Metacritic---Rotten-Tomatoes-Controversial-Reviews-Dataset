Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just didn't care for Rian Johnson's take on \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\" My main problem\\, is with how Johnson handled Luke Skywalker. I grew up as a fan of Luke; stood in line back in 77\\\" when I was about 10 years old. To see how Luke's character was handled in this film\\, was hard for me to watch. I also hated the fact that Johnson\\, pretty much\\, attempted to ignore so many story points presented to us in the Force Awakens. I just really\\, kind of hated this movie.","true":true}
