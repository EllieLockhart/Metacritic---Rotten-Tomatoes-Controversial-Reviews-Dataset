Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sloppy carryover from the previous films but takes a daring angle at humanizing our heroes. Ridiculous plot holes and side trains are mediated by the unexpected and gripping ideas introduced. It's a very creative and fun ride with messages with lasting impact. Many parts of this film have depth that reminds me of why I loved the originals. The lessons Luke learned in the originals are driven home more powerfully than ever\\, and the exploration of the Force is fascinating. Depth is given to Ben Solo as he and Rey communicate through the Force. While she makes many great decisions she foolishly listens to the dark side for answers. This film explores the Force\\, personal growth and the nature of good and evil in ways that open up minds and prompt powerful questions even after the movie ends.","true":true}
