Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly disappointed in the lastest release in the Star Wars universe. The Last Jedi seemed to try too hard and force the humor throughout the movie. I see that they were trying to make it different from the original movies but the force was used transformed from a \\\"force\\\" to a ludicrious power that was laughabale at points. I feel like JJ Abrams gave Rian Johnson an excellent story with Snoke and Rey's parents and he botched it.","true":true}
