Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The longer I think about the way this went\\, the more pleased I am with the film.  We see the failure and fallibility\\, and we see hope as well.  New leaders emerge on both sides as old ones take a backseat.  A cameo or two successfully surprises\\, and the stage is set for the dramatic conclusion in Episode IX to this sequel trilogy.  Haters wanting an immediate payoff or those who are upset that it didn't go the exact direction they wanted might be dropping the audience score\\, but I foresee that this film will grow on people with time!","true":true}
