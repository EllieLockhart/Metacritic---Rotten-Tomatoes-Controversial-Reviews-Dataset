Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson's vision for a bold new Star Wars film was intended to bring the series forward while \\\"letting the past die\\\". However Johnson's film was almost more insulting to fans who had expected consistency to the saga.  Subversion of expectations\\, which many critics praise about the film\\, was more disappointing than surprising as too much of the new trilogy's plot was thrown under the bus in this installment. The Force Awakens built anticipation as it teased fans by introducing new questions about the characters\\, the state of the Republic (or Rebels\/Resistance)\\, how Maas got Luke's lightsaber\\, to give to Rey\\, and just who is Snoke? Mr. Johnson however took none of this into consideration as if he was in charge of the next Star Wars anthology film. Johnson's attempt at his own Star Wars story went too far with the dismissal of everything the fans wanted to see. You will enjoy the high-budget visuals you'd come to expect from just about any Disney film these days\\, but for serious long-time fans of the saga\\, visuals alone are not enough when paired with hasty writing and creative overreach.","true":true}
