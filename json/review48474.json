Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With the central plotline of a Battlestar Galactica episode stretched to the length of feature film\\, a prequel-esque sideplot muddying its hefty\\, boring middle act and a frankly awe-inspiring plethora of plot contrivances\\, continuity errors\\, and contradictions both within itself and hte larger Star Wars saga\\, the Last Jedi is a two and a half hour long middle finger to the mysteries left in place by JJ Abrams and the foundations set by George Lucas\\, featuring a fundamental misunderstanding of what Star Wars is and who its characters are--set in a confusing timeframe and against a fairly dull background consisting of two samey spaceships\\, some wet island\\, a disgustingly\\, out-of-place human casino\\, and a literal planet of salt. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a broken film in more ways than one\\, and it took a sledgehammer to everything held dear by the fans. This film plays like it was created by a man who had never seen Star Wars\\, and the gut-punch felt when walking out of the theater feels like it was delivered by such a man. This movie is a harbinger of pure despair and devastation--despair and devastation at the loss of the possibilities this trilogy presented in 2015. The things the film accomplishes could have been accomplished within the runtime of a TV show episode\\, and all it does accomplish is to sickeningly destroy everything its predecessors worked for. \\n\\nAny Star Wars fan who enjoys this film and its portrayal of the Star wars universe should take a step back and think about that for a moment.","true":true}
