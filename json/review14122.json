Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you've been waiting years for Luke to be trashed and flattened into a failure with a minimal flashback with no basis in his character or what is shown on screen then this is the piece of junk for you. \\\"This one changes everything\\\" is an apt snippet. Too many plot holes and contradictory ideas. Thematically the film hammers the idea of learning from failure and the Myth of heroism which how it was done was not right for Star Wars. Boo hiss. \\\"That's not true. That's impossible!\\\" Is how I felt.","true":true}
