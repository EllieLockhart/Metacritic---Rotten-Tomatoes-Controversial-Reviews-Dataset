Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete disappointment of a movie due to a laughably poor script. There were too many logic defying moments in the movie that didn't even follow the rules setup within the Star Wars universe. \\n\\nIf you're totally fine with a galactic powerhouse chasing (more like leisurely jogging) after a cruiser because they can't figure out a watch to catch up to it\\, you'll love this movie. If you have a problem with that\\, skip it because it doesn't get any better.","true":true}
