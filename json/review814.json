Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent addition to the Star Wars saga! New elements provide a greater depth to this universe and its characters. Johnson works exceptionally well with the gifts given both in the prequel and original trilogies as well as the groundwork provided by Abrams in Episode VII.","true":true}
