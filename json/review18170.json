Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great! I loved the twists and turns of the movie\\, and I bought into it completely. Sure there were things that I didn't expect or necessarily want to have happen\\, but I have faith in the future of Star Wars and I can't wait to see what happens next.","true":true}
