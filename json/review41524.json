Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is by far the worst of the series. Jar Jar > Rey.  Kylo is a child. Snoke is a joke. And Finn's story line is simply silly. I don't want to say why cause spoilers\\, except Bombs in space  ... really.","true":true}
