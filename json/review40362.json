Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably the weekest Star Wars movie of the franchise. I mean it has no story\\, they misplay several Star Wars characters\\, and there are many plot holes that easily could've been solved. And they killed off one the most beloved Star Wars characters\\, Luke\\, in such a cowardly way: He just sat there and meditated instead of facing Ben in person. So overall\\, super disappointing.","true":true}
