Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After Episode I\\, Star Wars fans thought it could never get worse. After TFA\\, fans were hopeful for a trilogy worthy of the original. Sadly this movie sets a new rock bottom far worse than episode I could have ever imagined. The special effects and CGI are phenomenal\\, the soundtrack harkens back to the majesty of episodes 3-6. But even a polished turd is still a turd. Plot holes galore\\, minimal character development and in fact some characters just change personalities all togetherness. Extreme issues with comedic timing\\, tone and theme. After such promise with TFA and Rogue One\\, this movie desecrates everything Star Wars fans hold dear. The worst star wars movie ever made.
