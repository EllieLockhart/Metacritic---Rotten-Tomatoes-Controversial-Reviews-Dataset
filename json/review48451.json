Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without giving away too much\\, I'll say this. If I wanted to hear terrible jokes I'd go watch a Marvel film\\, or Space Balls if I wanted a science fiction backdrop with jokes. Having comedy is understandable but these jokes do not fit. The majority of the characters are hallow and do not live up to expectation. The coup de gras of this is one of the most forced romances I've ever seen in film. If you are going to see this\\, wait until you can rent it.","true":true}
