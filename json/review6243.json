Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has truly destroyed Star Wars. I couldn\u2019t be more upset as a huge fan of the Star Wars universe. There are so many plot holes and such poor character development. The humor in this film is so out of place and the physics of some people and objects is so out of place for the Star Wars universe. There are many moments where situations just didn\u2019t make sense and really won\u2019t grab you in. I will not be going to see the ninth installment after this joke of a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
