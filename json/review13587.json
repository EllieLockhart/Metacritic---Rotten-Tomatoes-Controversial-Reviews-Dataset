Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt Last Jedi was a very good movie. It was no Empire but it had a good storyline and tons of action. The biggest disappointment in the movie was Snoke. There was no back story for where he came from and how he came into power. Now he's gone. I felt that was a huge let down for many fans. I was not upset with Rey's lack of lineage as Anakin Skywalker also had no real family background that explain his strong powers with the force. I have a feeling some of these questions will be answered in Episode 8 or even in the spin-off trilogy Rian Johnson is working on. I would recommend seeing this movie if you're a fan of the franchise. You will not be disappointed. Don't be fooled by some of the negative ratings by the over-the-top fanboys that did not like the movie. They seem to be upset because the movie was not how they envisioned it while playing with their Star Wars Action Figures in their parents basements.","true":true}
