Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Undeveloped characters\\, non-climactic climaxes\\, and a plot that screamed\\, \\\"we'll throw in humor every 90-120 seconds to hide this film's shortcomings\\\". So disappointed; thought Disney deserved a second chance\\, but I for one will not be seeing anymore Star Wars movies. It's sad to see the death of a legendary epic and the birth of a monetized shit-show.","true":true}
