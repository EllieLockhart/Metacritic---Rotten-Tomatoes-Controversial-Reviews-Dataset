Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the best of the Star Wars films. A new trilogy targeted for a different generation of fans. Loved most of it\\, was disappointed with some of it. Didn't have the same feeling after The Force Awakens of awe and wonder and mystery. Tied up things too neat and didn't really leave much open for the next movie. Must watch again to really absorb all that happened.","true":true}
