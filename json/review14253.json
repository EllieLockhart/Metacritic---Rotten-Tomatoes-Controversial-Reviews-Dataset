Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore anyone who says \\\"But its for Children !\\\" - that has nothing to do with the monumentally pathetic storyboard\\, the idiotoic plot\\, the abysmal script or the films philosphical aim - which can only be described as a barely disguised insult to celloliod and anyone who paid for a ticket. The fact that the critics gave it 90% but less than half the audidence even liked it shows you the difference between ensureing the sucess of  a commercially important release - with what its actually like to watch this moronically laughable collection of offensively incongrous scenes and shocking character discontinuity - the likes of which can only be described as a fan-fiction humours parody accidentally sent out as the real film. Each and ever segment can be rated as \\\"what is the LEAST likely thing that could possibly happen in the original star-wars universe ?","true":true}
