Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like it better than all of the prequels\\, but not as much as any other star wars movie. There are definitely great parts\\, and thankfully Rey and Kylo Ren are the bright spots. There is a lot of chatter and different opinions about how Luke's character was portrayed\\, but I don't consider that a negative. It's just far from what we are used to as fans of Luke from ep. IV\\, V\\, VI. Similar to others\\, I think the entire casino excursion could've been cut from the movie and it wouldn't have really affected anything. That story arc was the weakest part of the movie\\, in my opinion.","true":true}
