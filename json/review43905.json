Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though not a perfect film\\, it's definitely better than the die-hard \\\"fans\\\" claim it to be. It may even be arguably the best mainline Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. The movie was really fun to watch\\, with many memorable scenes. The only big issue I had with it was the pacing in the first half being a little slow.","true":true}
