Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, I'm NOT a sequel hater.  I gave TFA a very good score and RoS a pretty decent score.  I really enjoyed both of those movies.  I also really enjoy several of Rian Johnson's other films.  Knives out was a very enjoyable movie where he subverted expectations at every turn (and Looper too\\, for that matter.)  I just don't know quite what happened with this movie.  Yes\\, he tried to go his own direction and subvert expectations about 3 or 4 too many times\\, but beyond that the movie fluctuates between being a silly slapstick comedy\\, a boring low speed chase snoozefest\\, intercut with some incredible scenes and story telling.\\n\\nLuke's a curmudgeony old guy?  Ok\\, I can live with that.  There's a weird force link between Kylo and Rey?  That's actually fresh and cool!  Kylo and his squadron of TIEs almost destroy the Resistance fleet and then\\, instead of sending more fighters to the attack and finishing them off\\, are instead called back so the First Order can wait for them to run out of f......zzzzzzz.\\n\\nIf I was uneasy with the silly assault on the dreadnaught (and the slapstick dialogue from Poe) then this is where I just couldn't keep my eyes from rolling back in my head.  It... just... it makes no sense.  So many things about this movie make no sense.  Some people have said that about Rise of Skywalker\\, and there are certainly some fair points there\\, but it just seems like so many motivations for plot points and characters feels completely wrong.\\n\\nI really have no problem with the first and third movies of the new trilogy\\, I really just didn't like this one.  Sorry Rian!","true":true}
