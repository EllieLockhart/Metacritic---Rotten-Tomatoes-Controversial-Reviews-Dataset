Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was surprisingly good. Unlike The Force Awakens\\, which started interestingly but then became a complete rehash\\, The Last Jedi is fresh throughout\\, with a lot of bold ideas that completely subvert traditional movie expectations. As with any Star Wars film\\, it's not perfect\\, and has its share of issues\\, but it's just plain fun and exciting\\, easily the best film since the original trilogy. It's not even close\\, really. In fact\\, it's so good it might just edge out Return of the Jedi for third best Star Wars film to date.\\n\\nFirst of all\\, it's action-packed\\, starting off with a bang and running hard through most of its massive two-and-a-half-hour running time. There are also plenty of well done slower scenes\\, particularly the interactions between Rey and Kylo Ren. And there is plenty of humor\\, some of which is a bit much\\, but the majority of which works well. \\nPlenty of people take issue with the way Luke Skywalker is handled in the film\\, and I can understand that to an extent\\, but I think I can also understand why it was done the way it was done. One of the great things about this film is that is expands the lore really well\\, and opens up lots of possibilities for the third movie in the trilogy. By the end\\, you really have no idea where the story will end up\\, which makes it pretty exciting to contemplate.\\n\\nThis is absolutely the most exciting Star Wars film to come out in decades. Lots of people are upset by it\\, but looking back at it in the context of the full story\\, I'm confident it will take its place near the top of the heap.","true":true}
