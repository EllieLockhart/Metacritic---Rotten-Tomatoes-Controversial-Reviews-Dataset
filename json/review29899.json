Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rotten Tomatoes has taken down the original review made for this title. This is a shorter version of it. \\nMany of the newer characters have actors that aren't amazing. Everything has changed without explanation in some cases. I thought that the anti climaxes were just \\\"ok\\\"\\, as many of them disappointed me. I'd give it a B","true":true}
