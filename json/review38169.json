Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The tone of this movie is very different than that of Force Awakens. I don't want to spoil anything but just about everything in this movie outside of the Jedi stuff is a total waste of time. I am soooo disappointed in this film. The music sounds and special effects are spot on but the rest is garbage.","true":true}
