Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film shows how this franchise will go strong for years to come. Yes it has issues\\, but when you ignore them you see the film is great\\, and has potential to amaze the youngest minds. I love this film and hope others realize this to.","true":true}
