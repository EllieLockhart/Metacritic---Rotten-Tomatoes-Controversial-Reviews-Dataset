Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated this movie so much\\, made an account to voice my disdain. \\n\\nThis film takes what \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" introduced\\, and completely shoves it aside with no payoff and then forces the ideology of \\\"letting go of the past\\\" to excuse its' lazy and terrible writing.\\n\\n- Luke Skywalker was completely out of character from a hopeful Jedi who never gave up on his family and friends\\, to a lonely hermit who came to a deserted island to die and avoid all responsibility. Some like to argue that Luke's behavior in this film is considered \\\"character growth.\\\" However\\, completely ignoring a character's personality is not growth\\, it's bad writing. Luke's portrayal also rubbed his actor\\, Mark Hamil\\, the wrong way which cause him to be vocal on social media. \\n\\n- Fin and Rose's entire side-plot did nothing to advance the story and only provided boring filler for the audience to fall asleep to. You can literally splice these scenes out of the movie and the story would not change.  Rose is a terribly written & unlikable character who serves as Finn's instantly-struck new love interest who has hypocritical views and overall says and does stupid things. \\n\\n- Supreme Leader Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, the Knights of Ren\\, ideas from Force Awakens are treated with  no payoff. If you were looking forward to learning more about these film elements\\, you're out of luck.\\n\\nThere are far more (and spoiler-ish) reasons why this movie is terrible which you can find on YouTube.\\n\\nRian Johnson and the Disney executives ruined Star Wars for me. The prequels may have had their own criticism and problems but The Last Jedi did not learn from those past mistakes and ended up making more. You do not build up plot elements to shove them aside with no payoff. What is even the point?\\n\\nUnless J.J. Abrams somehow retcons the events of this movie in the 3rd installment\\, I will not be attending the theater to watch that film. Disney will not be receiving any more money from me. If you didn't enjoy this movie either\\, I suggest doing the same. Don't watch the new film and let it rot at the box office.","true":true}
