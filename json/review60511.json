For so long I and we have been waiting to play a sequel to the TLOU a master piece of a game!  TLOU2 comes no where close.\r\rFirst off the good stuff\\, the graphics are outright the best I have seen which to be honest was expected considering how good the graphics are in the first game(when it came out) and the technology used to behind it.\r\rThe game play and combat mechanics is still really good but there really isn't much difference here from the first game. There is only some small minor things... you would think after 7 years there would be some decent improvement or changes.\r\rThe Story\\, the single most important element of the game - imo is a horrible experience to play through\\, one horrific bad s*** crazy thing after another. This story butchers the majority of characters especially the ones we have come to love from the first game.\r\rOK... I didn't like what they had done with certain characters but with one character in particular and the whole shocking scene with this said character had effected me quite negatively and from here on out I kinda had to FORCE my myself to play and finish the game(hoping there would be some good).\rNever in my life have I had to force myself to finish a game.\r\rWe are then forced to play most of the story\/game as a character who for me... well...hated(and probably for a lot of other people too). Playing as this now \\\"hated\\\" character makes it so much harder to play the game. The game has instantly lost its fun and interest factor.\r\rPoor character development... I won't elaborate to keep this review spoiler free.\r\rTLOU was and still is a fun\\, interesting\\, thrilling game to play and even though its 7 years later its still not bad to look at(graphics wise). The game has set the bar.... with the exception of the graphics TLOU2 however does not live up to that purely because of the continuation of horrible story events\\, poor character development and playing as a hated character through out!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
