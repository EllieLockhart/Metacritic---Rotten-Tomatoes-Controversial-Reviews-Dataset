Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie goes absolutely nowhere\\, it builds no excitement for the next installment and takes no risks. In no part of the movie do you feel emotionally attached to any character and by the end you could honestly not care what happens to each character in this story. It absolutely blows my mind that these \\\"critics\\\" can rate such a boring\\, bland story so high. Will never trust these critics reviews on movies ever again.","true":true}
