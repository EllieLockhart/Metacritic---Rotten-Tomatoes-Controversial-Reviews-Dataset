{"101487":130833,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't even know where to start. Probably the biggest problem about The Last Jedi is what they did with Luke character. I grow up watching Star Wars\\, first the original trilogy and then the prequels\\, and i had that feeling that nothing could change those characters\\, for example: Luke goes into a suicidal mission to fight against the Emperor and Darth Vader and in the same time wants to bring his father back to the good side. When Palpatine told him to kill Vader he refuse throwing his lightsaber. He did that because Vader was part of the family\\, and also he believed that is still good in him. In this film\\, Luke tried to kill his sister only kid\\, for seeing something dark inside him\\, no thats not my Luke. The 2nd problem is the humour. Every SW movie has some parts of humour but most of them work\\, even those in the prequels\\, but in this film\\, they were to many and most of them were put in wrong moments and i have a lot of examples\\, from the scene with Poe and Hux to the part with Luke on Crait. The 3rd problem is Leia and the force scene\\, horrible\\, just horrible. I even don't talk about Snoke scene when he was killed\\, or about the blue lightsaber used by luke on Crait\\, or about all plot with Finn and Rose. Im really sorry for JJ because all his ideas from TFA were unused and now he has to do the 9th episode and its hard because people like me lost their interest\\, no offence but I'm really not interested to see who wins\\, Rey or Kylo. I will give this film a star only because of John Williams\\, his score was awesome like all his work in this franchise and i quite like to stay and listen to it even if i didn't like the movie","true":true}
