{"101487":127475,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Help Us Mr. Lucas\\, You're our Only Hope...It actually does break my heart to click on. And the one star pretty much goes to seeing Adam Driver for the duration of the movie. Or the fish people hang laundry....\\nStar Wars came out when I was 7\\, that's 40 years of absolutely loving these films\\, even  the much-dissed prequel had some Star Wars authenticity that moved through them. But this film\\, is painful. I left feeling like all that could have been\\, was just destroyed. The potential for a great follow-up was there\\, and not only destroyed but done in the cheesiest possible way. I sat there in my Star Wars ugly Christmas sweater\\, wondering who the eff looked at this script and said Yes! that's amazing. Let me start with my top cheesiest moments - \\nPrincess Leia flying through the galaxy - Luke being disgruntled ALL THE TIME. Snoke. Why bother making such a big deal about him only to take him out\\, and the in-person Snoke was very underwhelming. Kylo Ren through whole movie sitting and having imaginary conversations with Rey. Part of the excitement of the force awakens was watching the way he moves through everywhere. The Casino (wtf). who cares. the \\\"coder\\\" who cares\\, so much who cares\\, Fin and Rose ??? who cares. The Rebellion standing still in front of the First Order for days and days yet can't be destroyed (really????) Rey following Luke around for days (at least his training with Yoda was interesting) And we see her fling the light saber around a little bit. Weird scene with Ben (adam driver adult face supposed to be a child?) and Luke in the Jedi school\\, The stupid jokes (Poe) made it cringe worthy like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit\\, it wasn't Star Wars humor it was modern day walking around LA humor\\, there's a difference.... I could go on and on. I Love Star Wars... I cannot even convey how disappointed  When the movies came to theatres\\, as a kid\\, I would go see them every weekend until they left (this was long before instant DVD release). I  loved the Force Awakens\\, and had not felt that excited since seeing Empire Strikes back. After seeing The Force Awakens I loved the potential for the story ahead\\, to continue on with a much beloved legacy of films. I left The Last Jedi movie not even wanting to think about that within 2 hrs and 33 minutes someone managed to destroy Star Wars. I wondered who read this\\, who saw this happening and did not stop it\\, did it get all Disneyed-up and now its ruined? The story had no flow\\, the characters behaved out of character\\, they threw-in everything they could and it looked crazy. Less is more\\, when it comes to Star Wars. I feel when I read the excited reviews that it is much like what has happened to our country in 2017\\, people have lost their effing minds.","true":true}
