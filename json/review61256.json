We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is a story-driven game\\, thus relying heavily on it's story. Gameplay and graphics are a minor point compared to this.\r\rThe story of The Last Of Us clearly went downwards since the first installment. Every credible source will tell you this fact as well. Personally I think this is connected to the fact that ND crunched a lot of employees in the making of this game. Eventually they didn't know what to\\, since all the competent people left the company\\, so they decided to make this.\r\rAfter playing the game\\, I could probably tell you the names of about 3 characters\\, the ones from the first game not included. These people are the same throughout the game. There is no character development. I think the game does try to make you care about it's characters and there troubles\\, but I haven't met a credible source that say they do care about the characters. Neither do I. It is clear that the writers of this game are not the same as the last game\\, to say the least. Futhermore\\, after viewing the trailers for this game you wouldn't think this is the direction it would you. Plenty of people feel baited into buying this game. Luckily I have managed to refund it.\r\rThe gameplay is solid\\, however it is a copy and paste of the first installment.\r\rThe graphics are not bad\\, but that is what you expect from a game that has been in development for 7-8 years.\r\rAll in all I give this game a 0\/10\\, for it did not deliver.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
