Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm the leftiest liberal ever and I think this movie harmed my personal ideals. Those responsible have shown zero recognition of the damage to the brand\\, the lore\\, and egalitarian views in general\\, that this movie inflicted on the world. I like everyone who worked on this film\\, and many of them made great choices. As always\\, those at the top are responsible for the wretched soul-cringing decisions about the narrative that makes this truly one of the worst teleplays ever committed to film. Watch only if you can surgically remove all memory of the existence of Star Wars; then I'm sure it's beautiful!!!!11!q","true":true}
