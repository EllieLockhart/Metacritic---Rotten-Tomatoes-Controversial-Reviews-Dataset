Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always loved the Star Wars franchise. I have loved Star Wars more than any other movie franchise\\, something about it just really appealed to me. That is perhaps why I feel so utterly disappointed by this poor excuse of a film. I feel my love has been betrayed by a director with a flippant disregard for the story and the history of the Star Wars universe. \\nI have never rolled my eyes so much in a movie before\\, I thought I might get eye strain. There are so many nonsensical sequences\\, lazy visuals\\, plot holes\\, lame jokes and gotcha moments that I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen in disgust. I was truly sadden at what they did to my favourite franchise and I knew that this was it\\, my love affair with Star Wars was finished. Disney stole my childhood dreams and sold them for a dollar. I won't be back.","true":true}
