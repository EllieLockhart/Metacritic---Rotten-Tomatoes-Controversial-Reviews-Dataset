Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. I like where they were going with Rey and Kylo\\, then nothing... Finally we get to see Snoke and then nothing... Finn and Rose story arc was completely pointless and made very little sense. Luke has been developing for 40+ years\\, and all of a sudden everything we thought we knew goes out the window. And my dear Carrie Fisher was turned into a joke. Rian Johnson has no respect for fans or the universe that was built. He was handed a golden canvas and wiped his ass with it. Oh my god the schtick comedy was over the top and out of place\\, cringe at best. Trying way too hard to force comedic moments\\, and i swear there were a few times they obviously paused for laughs. Nothing Luke did in this film in character\\, it was so far out of character you were left scratching your head. Easily the worst piece of SW canon ever conceived. I encourage all to watch at least once to form your own oponion\\, but  expect to be disappointed. This is where Star Wars dies\\, and aside from from re shooting and re writing 75% of the movie to release a \\\"directors\\\" cut or whatever you want to call it. Episode IX can't reverse this. It hurts to see our\/my childhood bastardized and so disrespected. Hopefully we will get a proper episode VIII\\, until then I will take comfort in the og trilogy and Rogue One. May the force be with anyone who can fix this abomination.","true":true}
