Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It absolutely takes the sage to places I didn't expect\\, and for a moment or two that shook me to my very core. But then I realised I loved that. Loved that it's a continuation of the spirit of star wars\\, not a simple rehash of what came before. Did it give me all the answers I craved? No. Did I come out with a big grin\\, a torn apart heart\\, and a want to follow the story wherever it goes? Absolutely.","true":true}
