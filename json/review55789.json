Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pluses and Minuses of the movie in my view:\\nPluses:\\n-Unexpected twists.\\n-Original content. Not a remake of ESB\\n-Makes Episode IX a mystery\\n-The Force connection between Kylo Ren and Rey\\n-Daisy Ridley's face\\n-Great development of new characters like Poe and Finn\\n-BB-8\\n-Leia actually used The Force (I think)\\n\\n\\nMinuses\\n-Guardians of The Galaxy style humor and comic relief-absolutely off the point in SW context\\, distracting from the plot. Does not enhance plot\/character development like it did in TFA. \\n-Certain scenes looked like Jimmy Kimmel sketches not actual Star Wars\\n-Luke Skywalker-absolute waste of the most the most iconic character in the franchise. We don't get to experience his wisdom\/power or motivations. \\n-Does Luke actually teach Rey anything? \\n-The new girl (Finn's friend)\\, very poor character-skip\\n-The casino sequence (all of it)\\n-The two ladies that help Leia lead the Resistance\\n-Ray is just a random person?\\n-The pacing. \\n-The movie does not have a definitive climax. What's the most important moment of the movie? \\n-Trying to play on cheap emotions by making cheap emotional speeches that are in fact clicheic and disposed of any emotional charge. \\n-Snoke","true":true}
