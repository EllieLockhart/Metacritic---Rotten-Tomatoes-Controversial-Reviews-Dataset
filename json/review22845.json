Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long\\, drawn out political propaganda movie; badly written story and characters; stupid juvenile humor; characters from the original trilogy are destroyed to make room for the new protagonists and it doesn't work because not one of them is believable or likeable. It completely kills all the story and lore we've been given thus far and it's simply not fun.","true":true}
