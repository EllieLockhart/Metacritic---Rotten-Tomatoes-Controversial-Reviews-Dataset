Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Just terrible. Far too \\\"kiddy\\\" and far too many forced jokes that don't work. Sure\\, Star Wars should have the occaisional gag but not one every two minutes. It was also way too long for no good reason. You know it's not good when you are just hoping for it to hurry up and end. Only good thing to say about it was that the special effects and general cinematography are excellent but everything else was a real step backwards\\, so bad you might as well have brought JaJa Binks back into it. Such a let down after Rogue One being so fantastic. Luke Skywalker deserved better.","true":true}
