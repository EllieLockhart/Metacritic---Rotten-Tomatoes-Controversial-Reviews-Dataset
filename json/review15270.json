Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\\, like so many before me\\, have come here to give a a word of warning to any true Star Wars fans. As the nearly 40% differential between critic and fan reviews will show you\\, this film is incredibly divisive. From pointless subplots to poorly considered character development\\, it's clear that Rian Johnson has no idea what made us all love this franchise and these characters in the first place. We are not angry because 'none of our predictions came true\\,' we are angry that logically the parameters of this universe\/the Force\/our beloved character's personalities and capabilities no longer make sense. Furthermore\\, rather than giving us a complex\\, layered heroine in the form of Rey\\, we are left with another Mary Sue\\, telling our young girls that they have to be absolutely perfect with no physical\\, emotional\\, or human flaws that could actually compromise their ability to always succeed. Absolutely shameful. I thought I would always  go see Star Wars\\, but Disney has turned it into a pointless\\, farsical puppet show for pre-teens.","true":true}
