Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disjointed mess. The story made more problems for the franchise than it solved. Its as though they doubled down on the issues criticized in The Force Awakens. Characters have abilities at random and rather than spending time on character development they focus on what in essence is a side quest.","true":true}
