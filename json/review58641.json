The creators of this game could have given us the first game with Joel and Ellie but had Abby chase us due to her fathers death or maybe have Ellie rescue Joel from Abby's base at the aquarium. There were so many other routes this game could have and should have gone. 7 years of waiting to watch Joel die to a girl he happened to conveniently run into and save in the wild\\, even though Joel had a ton of trust issues in the first game and still did. Ellie learned nothing from finding Abby and fighting her. She ditches Dina and the baby to go fight Abby\\, to not end up killing her\\, lose two of her fingers\\, and everyone that cared about her. The pacing was a mess\\, the fights were mashing the square button or triangle button and the clickers felt easier to fight! No more shiv making for Ellie! She just has a knife that never breaks so now you can beat clickers easier than the walking infected lol. Also\\, thank you for tricking us in the trailers showing older Joel as if he was actually a big part of the game\\, but instead it was cut scenes of the past Joel. What a mess. Please\\, I beg you not to make a third game as that will continue to destroy the brilliance of what the first game was as this game has.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
