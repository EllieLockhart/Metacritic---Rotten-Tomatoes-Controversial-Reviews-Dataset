Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good parts in this movie had to do with Luke and Rey. All the other new characters were terrible. Poe is the new Jar Jar Binks\\, except Jar Jar was a more competent commander. Leia and purple haired Laura Dern are the worst military minds ever. They don't share information with their underlings\\, leading to resentment and mutiny and then they laugh it off because Poe is cute. This move sets back women's rights 1000 years.\\n\\nThis movie supposedly took risks. BS. If they really wanted to take a risk they would have killed off Finn in the part where Rose saves him because she's everything she despises. Finn's character would have gone through an amazing arc\\, actually giving a damn and sacrificing himself. Rose's character is pointless. Finn and Rose's wild adventure is pointless. The plotline of this movie is pointless.\\n\\nThere were better plotline ideas on youtube channels than what actually came to pass here. Shame.","true":true}
