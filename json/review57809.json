Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning: Spoilers! Do not read this if you haven't seen The Last Jedi. \\n\\n\\nTo all of you haters\\, bandwagon haters\\, and biased Billys out there\\, what are you talking about? If you're posting a review on any piece of entertainment\\, then you should ensure that your review is unbiased and not dependent on feelings you have on the franchise as a whole. You love Star Wars; I get it. But that doesn't warrant giving a terrible review because the The Last Jedi didn't meet your standards for a \\\"Star Wars\\\" film. \\n\\nThe movie was good\\, but it wasn't perfect. There are instances that feel a bit off due to the nature of the story. Various side plots make it hard to follow at times\\, yet this aspect pushes the characters forward with a head full of steam. Without holding back\\, Rian Johnson sets the roadwork for the next film by progressing the characters along different\\, inventive\\, and\\, by the end\\, intertwining paths through the story. \\n\\nYet\\, I understand why you hardcore Star Wars fans are upset. If you've seen the film\\, then you're aware of the scene that includes: Kyle killing Snoke to save Rey\\, them battling his guards\\, and then Kylo offering his hand to join him in his quest to rid the world of the past. The past\\, he says earlier in the movie\\, must be killed. Adam Driver does such an excellent job in portraying the conflict brewing within him throughout the movie\\, to the point that when he begs Rey to join him\\, you should understand his reaction when she doesn't. He feels as lost as before\\, because the one person that he thought shared his aspirations is actually one of those trying to stop him. He thought that Rey would join him in his quest to rid the world of the past\\, so\\, when she doesn't\\, he realizes that maybe he is as evil as Luke thought\\, and that replacing Snoke as the Supreme Leader is his only option. It doesn't need to be said\\, because the movie shows Rey and Kylo's relationship unfold as the movie progresses. I think the problem for all the haters resides in these two characters' relationship. People wanted Kylo to turn to the light; that didn't happen\\, so\\, naturally\\, they were furious. And yet\\, his decision makes sense. \\n\\nThis is only a brief discussion of that all-important scene. If you're one of those bashing The Last Jedi\\, then I suggest re-watching it and paying attention to all the details which lead to Kylo's decision. If it's something else that bothers you\\, then\\, as I said before\\, what are you talking about? I don't see anything else seriously wrong that can be bashed on\\, except for the confusion surrounding Kylo. But hey\\, that's just me.","true":true}
