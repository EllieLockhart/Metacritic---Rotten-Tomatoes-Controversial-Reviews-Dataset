Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been more dissapointed watching a movie.  I thought this movie would exceed the awesome Force Awakens but it turned out to be poorly written\\, cliched\\, poorly acted\\, convoluted and difficult to watch.  Worst movie I've seen in a long time.  The critics must be afraid or paid off by Disney.  What garbage.","true":true}
