Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Original in so many ways as well as call-backs to previous episodes. Definitely worth seeing a second time to catch what wasn't noticed the first time around.","true":true}
