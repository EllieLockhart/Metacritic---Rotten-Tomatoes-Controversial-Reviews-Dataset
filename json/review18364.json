Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was the best out of all the Disney Star Wars movies so far. If you remember when episodes 1-3 came out\\, some of the fan boys got butt hurt over certain things...you can\u2019t please everyone! However every person in the theatre seemed to love this one. Many cheers\\, laughs and applause! The movie delivered to say the least!","true":true}
