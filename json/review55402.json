Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made by people who do not like the Star Wars heritage. Every character is  treated like a joke. Tone death through out as a war battles\\, huge body counts\\, and in the midst of all that jokes galore. One of the dumbest films I have ever seen. This film is PROOF critics were paid to say it was good. Completely wrecks the franchise. This makes the prequels look Oscar worthy. Forget Episode 9. The best parts of the story are over and the best characters are gone.","true":true}
