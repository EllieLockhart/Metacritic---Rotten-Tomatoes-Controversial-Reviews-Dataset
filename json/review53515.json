Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Edited from 3 to 1 star after watching a second time. I did enjoy the Rifftrax version though!\\n\\nI was for sure entertained.  As a deep rooted fan of the franchise my expectations were likely unreasonably high.  I'm having trouble with the dimensionality of Kylo (I hear other fans think he is the most complex villain of the franchise but that doesn't say much then about villains of the franchise).  I'm having a lot of trouble emotionally attaching to many of the characters (Rey\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Kylo\\, etc)...Maybe I fear I'm just growing out of Star Wars all these years.","true":true}
