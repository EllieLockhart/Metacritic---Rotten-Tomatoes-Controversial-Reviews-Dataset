Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot holes in this movie really hurt my brain. \\nI love 4\\,5 and 6. I tried to forget 1\\,2 and 3. But man I was excited for this after seeing what they did with Force Awaken but this really hurt to watch. It feels like someone watched a bunch of Star Wars clips on Youtube and wrote a script over it. The action is great. Space Battles amazing...... Story script and plot baffling. AND WHAT THEY DID WITH LUKE..... You ruined Luke Skywalker... Luke saved his Dad.. But had to kill Ben... why?","true":true}
