Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans\\, which is evident with the viewer reviews\\, but as a die hard fan from the first time seeing Star Wars in the \u201880\u2019s as a kid I can honestly say this movie was brilliant in its execution of giving you a fully unexpected experience. Fan\u2019s biggest complaints after The Force Awakens was that it was too similar to A New Hope and now their biggest complaint with this one is that it didn\u2019t spoon feed them everything that they wanted or expected. After letting go of expectations after the first couple of reveals didn\u2019t go the way I thought they would go I thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of this entry in the Star Wars saga.
