Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I disagree with the negative reviews about this movie. I thought it was excellent! It is a set up for episode nine. I\u2019ll see this movie several times while it\u2019s at the theaters before I rank it amongst the other Star Wars movies.","true":true}
