Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst excuse for a Star Wars film I've ever seen. The way Luke was portrayed was all wrong. The way Rose stopped Finn from dying a heroic death goes against the morals of Star Wars and understanding that there are things worth dying for and that saving the cause is more important than one person. This movie sucked. Plain and simple. ","true":true}
