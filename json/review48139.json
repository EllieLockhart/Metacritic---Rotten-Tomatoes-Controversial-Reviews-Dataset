Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there were some minor flaws in a few areas mostly involving pacing and over-used chase elements like objects that made me go \\\"shouldn't they have just got knocked off of the thing they're riding?\\\" I enjoyed this film immensely. I went in with\\, as usual\\, no expectations\\, and was pleasantly surprised. The story was surprising\\, and I was happy with the result. I recommend it","true":true}
