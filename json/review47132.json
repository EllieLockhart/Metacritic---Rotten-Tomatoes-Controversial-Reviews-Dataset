Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a let down this movie was.  After TFA failed to do anything with Luke\\, it was up to this movie to fix that mistake.  Well it failed miserably and robbed fans of what they have been wait for since the original trilogy.  Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson are ruining this franchise.  Such a disappointment for fans and a rare failure by Disney.  I really have no desire to see the last movie in the trilogy at this point.  Kathleen needs to go!","true":true}
