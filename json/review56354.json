Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie does not feel like star wars to me\\, i was that bored in the theatre i started looking at other audience members lots of people shaking there heads or with there faces in the palms of there hands never thought i would see the day where this was possible during a star wars movie. The biggest laugh the movie got during my viewing was the flying through space scene not sure that was meant to be the funniest moment but oh well. I could write an essay on what i did not like about the film but i'm trying my best to forget it so instead i will go over some things i liked about the movie. the design of the resistance bomber ships\\, the design of the speeders on the red dust planet\\, the red dust planet itself and the scene with r2 and luke using the hologram from a new hope that's it off the top of my head\\, this is the first star wars movie i have only seen once in theatre's and the first one where i have not purchased the home release nuff said..","true":true}
