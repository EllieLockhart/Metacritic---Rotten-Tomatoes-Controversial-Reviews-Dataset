Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me it was a big mess. It had no back story for either Kylo nor Ray and that's what we wanted the most in the movie.  We wanted to see how Ben Solo became Kylo Rin and how the knights of Rin were formed. As for Ray we wanted it to be like when Yoda was training Luke in Empire and learn more of her family history. Instead we got Luke who wants to hang him self. The last Jedi was pretty much hay let's drive this ship till it's out of gasoline.  As for fin and Rose that part in the movie was the worst. Every time it jumped back to Fin and Rose you just wanted to leave.  It's just had no point. The movie had a horrible intro. It should have taken place a year after the force awakens not 30 minutes later.  I say episode 8 never happened and we remake it.","true":true}
