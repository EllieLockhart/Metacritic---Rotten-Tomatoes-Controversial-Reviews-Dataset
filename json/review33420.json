Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Talk about taking a risk. The Last Jedi has to be the most divisive film to date and for that I love it. It really brought something completely new and entertaining. I can see why some fans will be oppose to this film\\, but even I\\, a fan since the age of ten can appreciate the look and feel of what this director has given us. The Last Jedi brings a new chapter to this generation. Let the haters hate\\, but to me the force is strong with this film.","true":true}
