Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best starwars episode of all time. Love luke but im liking this one bcoz new breed of jedis should be introduced and letting luke go means going on a space adventure with new generations.","true":true}
