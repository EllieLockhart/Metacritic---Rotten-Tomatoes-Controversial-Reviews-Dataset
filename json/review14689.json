Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never cared enough to leave a review for a movie before\\, but I was willing to take time out just to make an account here and review this movie. There is so much to be said\\, but I'm not as articulate as the other essay writers on here so here's my pro\/con list.\\n\\nPro:\\nKylo Ren\\n\\nCon: \\n1. Mary Sue Rey\\n2. Superman Leia\\n3. Useless and Boring Rose\\n4. Equally boring but even more useless Finn.\\n5. Not-Plagueis but somehow uber powerful and creepy bathrobe Snoke.\\n6. Literally a couple hundred \\\"rebels\\\" vs. MILLIONS of stormtroopers but still manage to escape?\\n7. ZERO world building. It's like the universe has been reduced to only the Neo-Rebellion vs Neo-Empire. \\n8. Holdo? \\n9. Alien-milking Luke\\nThe list could go on but why bother...","true":true}
