Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good! A few weird plot points but one could assume they are setting some stuff up for the next movie.  Alot of bad reviews are just people stuck to much in the old movies and don't like seeing some changes to classic characters.  I would assume after everything that happened Luke would be alot different character.  More realistic than anything.","true":true}
