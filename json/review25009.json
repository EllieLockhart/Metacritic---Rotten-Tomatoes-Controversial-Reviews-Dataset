Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My reasoning for 2.5 stars. There were both some major and minor issues in this episode of Star Wars. The slow middle portions in CB I'd say are median\\, minor technical shots such as Leia in space witch mode\\, and major issues such as continuity in story due to change in directors between JJ \/ Rian Johnson. If there was one director I believe it would have a more linear - story driven feel rather than a director's choice grab bag for the end result. Now we are left with a semi open field for Episode 9 as we have another change in direction. I'm not a hardcore fan\\, but I didn't like the direction this film drove the new trilogy.","true":true}
