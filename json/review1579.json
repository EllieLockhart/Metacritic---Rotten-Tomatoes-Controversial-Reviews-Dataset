Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, this movie provides enough to make it worthy of the franchise. Adam Driver's performance cements a strong pillar for the franchise to embrace. Although lacking in major development or the shock and emotion of Empire\\, Last Jedi transitions in a new age of canon and story. The battle scenes and depiction of the Star Wars galaxy are on par with other films\\, but don't do much to force fans to remember them. For its length\\, I personally expected more from this installment\\, but I was left entertained and satisfied and excited to see where the franchise will take me. The big issue is whether Episode IX can provide the climax that Last Jedi seems to be depending on to satisfy fans.","true":true}
