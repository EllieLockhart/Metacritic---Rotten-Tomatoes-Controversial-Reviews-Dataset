Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a part of a Saga\\, this movie fails in many aspects. As a stand alone film for people that know about Star Wars\\, it is... OK.\\n\\nPlot holes - too many. First battle\\, jokes that make it feel like a damn Marvel movie and not the Winter Soldier\\, but Thor Ragnarok. Bombers that defy the lack of gravity. Spaceships that have no protection and are taken out by a crashing ship (single fighter). Characters that keep secret plans and end up costing most of the lives they are supposed to be saving. Side quests that were useless. Characters that went against the very basic nature of their characters in order to fit the story the director wanted to tell instead of servicing the characters. An evil empire that was shown as huge in a previous film but here seems to be very small... Same with the Resistance. And I could go on. The movie left the story closed for me. No interest in where this goes. No growth in any of the main characters from the previous movie. Oh\\, and Phasma?! Total let down. And Finn a pilot!? When? How? I could go on but at this point I can just say\\, if you are a big fan of the saga\\, you will be disappointed. If you are a casual fan that doesn't really care about the previous trilogies\\, you will enjoy it. As long as you are not like me\\, looking for an exciting\\, logical story that A) services the well-established characters. B) has logical plot twists. Over an out.","true":true}
