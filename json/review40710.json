Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This long time fan loved it and will be seeing it again ! I cried from excitement\\, grief and happiness! Aside from being a Star Wars movie it also had all the makings of an epic stand alone film. I love seeing the diversity in casting and increased roles for woman. As a female Star Wars fan for a young age it's great to see this.","true":true}
