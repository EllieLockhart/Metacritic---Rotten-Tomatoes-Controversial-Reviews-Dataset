Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things I didn't like about this movie. I won't restate so many things that have already been stated over and over again. RJ and KK changed up the formula and tried to apply ( and copy ) the MCU humor formula. It's clear that a majority of people on earth do not appreciate the way the movie was made and do not agree with the way the story was told.  My half star is for the visual effects and scene settings. John Williams was awesome per usual.","true":true}
