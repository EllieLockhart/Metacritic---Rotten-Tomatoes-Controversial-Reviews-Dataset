Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining schlock.\\n\\nThis movie follows in the footsteps of the 'Transformers' and 'Fast & the Furious\\\" franchises\\, using a never ending series of spectacular action sequences in place of a cohesive plot. Character motivations don't make sense\\, there's no consistency with the lore\\, and in the end\\, no rules of the Star Wars universe matter anymore.\\n\\nIf you can temporarily lobotomize yourself\\, you'll enjoy the movie. But if you have any understanding of how a functional narrative is constructed\\, and aren't part of a cult that is conditioned to defend Star Wars against all criticisms\\, you're going to realize how awful this movie is. Star Wars: the Last Jedi represents much of what's wrong with Hollywood today. Save your money; wait for Netflix\\, Red Box\\, or something like that\\, if you must watch it.","true":true}
