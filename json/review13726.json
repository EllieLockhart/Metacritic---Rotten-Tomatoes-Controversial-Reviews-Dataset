Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, it would be maybe a 3 star movie. They quite literally just dropped 3 major plot lines\/questions from the Force Awakens. Actually\\, it's almost like the Force Awakens didn't even happen. I quite literally have no interest in Episode 9. This movie wasted and squandered so many characters.","true":true}
