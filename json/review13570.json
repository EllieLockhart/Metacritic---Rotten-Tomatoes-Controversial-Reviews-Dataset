Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"I felt a great disturbance in the Force\\, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.\\\"\\n\\nI saw this movie exactly 2 weeks ago and I still can't get over how disappointed I am.  Rian Johnson has no business directing another Star Wars movie.  The humor was overly done and awkward (like Guardians of the Galaxy).  The character development was poor.  The story line was weak.\\n\\nI waited over 30 years to see Luke Skywalker return to the screen.  I wanted to see how far he came.  How powerful he's become.  I wanted to see him as a mentor and teacher.  I never wanted to see him hopeless and destitute.  No true fan wanted this.  Seeing Luke toss the light saber was painful to watch.  It didn't even feel like I was watching Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nI liked the Force Awakens\\, Rouge One and even the Prequels.  This is the first Star Wars movie I won't see in the theater more than once.  I probably won't be able to even stomach it on Netflix.\\n\\nAll I have now is the memory of the past.  I have no hope for the Star Wars future after this movie.  I left feeling completely empty and I have no desire to even care about what happens next.  \\n\\nIf you liked this movie\\, good for you.  However I feel sorry that you don't realize in your limited thinking how wonderful it could have been.","true":true}
