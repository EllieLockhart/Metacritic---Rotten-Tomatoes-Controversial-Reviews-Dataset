Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't completely hate The Last Jedi\\, but I didn't really like it either. Star Wars is getting the Disney treatment. They are removing any adult who is an authority figure especially if they are men (aka Snoke\\, Luke\\, Han) and replacing them with petulant children who can magically do anything and everything better than their adult counterparts ever could without really trying (aka Rey\\, Kylo Ren). Because it was the first time in TFA and Harrison Ford wanted his character to die\\, it went unnoticed. However\\, it did not translate well in TLJ as they went overboard by killing off Luke\\, and Snoke. Whiny millennials have overtaken Star Wars\\, and it sucks.","true":true}
