Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fine looking movie but a very very bad Star Wars film. Good acting but a very very bad script. Some of the things have just totally destroyed any hope of a good ending to this tripple-triology. Please get Kathleen Kennedy of the post as a creative decition maker.","true":true}
