Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great movie. I loved Star Wars as a child and was very happy to see the story move forward and become more inclusive. This last episode was great because finally we get to see that there is light and darkness within each one of us. Luke was afraid of the darkside\\, but he was trained to feel that way. He was amazed when Rey went with it and did not question it. Ben Solo now Kylo Ren still feels the light calling him\\, he came from light\\, but because he felt neglected (a sensitive child) he was an easy target for Snoke. Ben has been nothing but manipulated. Rey wants to learn more about what is within her\\, it may not all be light. No one is made up of just light. We are human\\, so bravo for this much needed film to carry the story forward for my niblings.","true":true}
