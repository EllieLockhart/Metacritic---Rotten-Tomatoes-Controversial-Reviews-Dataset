Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As this movie was written whilst The Force Awakens was being filmed\\, I love the fact that the fan-driven agendas as to the mysteries behind the characters and story arc\\, did not influence Rian Johnson in any way when it came to writing this movie.  He wrote the movie he\\, as a lifetime fan\\, wanted to see and it means you have a movie so full of surprises and edge of your seat entertainment that it will demand repeat viewings just to take it all in. Canon junkies will love the subtle\\, and not so subtle\\, aspects included from previous books\/films yet the movie does not rely on them to tell its story.  In many ways this movie is so chock full of Star Wars goodness\\, it feels like Episode 8 and 9 have been combined yet it all seems work.  JJ Abrams has a huge task ahead of him in rounding this trilogy out as he returns to write and direct Episode 9.   See The Last Jedi before you're spoiled!","true":true}
