Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the movie boring and not exciting. The best part of the movie was Rey and Kylo Ren fighting the Praetorian Guard. The casino planet was totally unneeded. The much anticipated return of Luke Skywalker was a total let down. as Yoda put it he did not pass on what he had learned.","true":true}
