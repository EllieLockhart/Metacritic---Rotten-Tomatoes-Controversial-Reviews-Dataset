Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie so bad...up until The Last Jedi\\, I thought it was impossible for me to not like anything Star Wars-related.  I even enjoy watching the prequels and cartoons.  Unfortunately\\, The Last Jedi proved me wrong.  There's just too many things they ruined\\, but I'll list a few off the top of my head.  Biggest storylines from The Force Awakens were who are Rey's parents (and they kept making a big deal out of it)\\, what's Snoke's background\\, Finn and Captain Phasma's rivalry\\, and Kylo Ren's future after killing his father.  Instead of finding creative ways to deal with these\\, we had a director who decided he would go with lazy writing instead.  Instead of building on those storylines and characters\\, they just killed them off and focused on more obscure crap like looking for a hacker and traveling slowly through space for what seemed like half the movie.  Then key characters like Phasma and Snoke just get a quick axe in dumb ways.  Especially Snoke right after he shows how much more powerful he is than Kylo\\, gets killed by him.  It would be like Vader dying from a blaster shot....really?  I can't talk about how upset this whole thing has made me.  Please remake Episode 8!  My favorite movie series is officially ruined.","true":true}
