Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi failed to give you the \\\"Star Wars movie\\\" feel. Very much gimmicky\\, parody\\, and corny lines made me look around the theater to make sure I was still watching a Star Wars movie. Not a fan with the script\\, and character development is starting to take a turn to the pits. I would instead invest in episodes 1-6\\, for any more \\\"Star Wars\\\" movies will not deliver as long as Disney owns the rights to Lucas Films.","true":true}
