Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi ruined Star Wars for me. How are they just going to have Snoke appear and then immediately die before explaining how he wasn't even mentioned or acknowledged in any of first six films? You really think Emperor Palpatine would of allowed a power Sith like that to exist to threaten his power? When he and Vader were hunting down all the other jedi\\, how did a powerful force user like Snoke slip through their hunt? Who is he? What is the first order and how did he establish it? All these questions\\, completely ignored. The writing team decided to focus on themes instead of a good and coherent story\\, and this is why the new trilogy makes no sense in context to the old one; and why I have said goodbye to the Star Wars fandom. I will not watch as Star Wars becomes the next Pirates of the Caribbean franchise\\, being filled with lack luster writing as they attempt to wring as much money as possible from it as it will lack anything resembling a sensible and coherent plot.","true":true}
