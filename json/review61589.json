Game play is just still the same old TLOU and there is nothing more. Story is just really weak and is garbage. Destroyed lovable characters and there is too many plot holes. Seems dragging and boring. New characters are just not that relate-table for me. This is just not the sequel I am looking for.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
