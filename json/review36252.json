Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last shit was a shit movie wasted my money thinking it was going to be great they need to fire rian Johnson and his crew just throw all them to the trash and get a better crew rian Johnson is still shit he ruined Star Wars","true":true}
