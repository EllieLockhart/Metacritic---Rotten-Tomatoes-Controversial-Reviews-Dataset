Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a total let down for me. It wasn't really much depth and the up and coming conclusion for this trilogy doesn't seem like it's going to be memorble. The Last Jedi is just a movie. A movie you see only once because it lacks so much substance.","true":true}
