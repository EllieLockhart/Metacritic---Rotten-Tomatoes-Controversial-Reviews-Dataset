Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many sub pots. Watered down Stars Wars. Not enough focus on Luke and Leia or Rey and Kylo for that matter. If your looks character right out of the back of the bus.! I think it ranks above the prequels. Don't get me wrong there was some cool stuff just overall disappointing. Rogue one was my movie","true":true}
