Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long star wars fan\\, I feel it is my duty to keep this score down.  Just saw TLJ\\, last night and was sooo disappointed.  It's an absolute travesty to turn Luke into a whinny bitch and then kill him off.  No development of snoke\\, or phasma\\, and then kill them off. This director as well as Disney have no idea what it means to make a true star wars movie or to be a fan.  The saddest things as this trend will continue as:1. They got their 1Bill dollar movie revenue and 2. The critics liked it.  The worst part of all is that I don't want to see episode 9 anymore. And I saw the originals in the theater as a boy.
