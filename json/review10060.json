Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great job! Great follow up to Force Awakens. The story did not go in the direction I thought it might but\\, you know--so what? I liked the new characters and the returning characters and now I am anxious to see where the story takes us in Episode IX! Do not pay any attention to the spoiled nay Sayers! Go see this!","true":true}
