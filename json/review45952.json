Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually beautiful\\, but plotwise\\, it is a huge mess. Rian Johnson did a huge disservice to the rich lore surrounding the original trilogy of SW\\, and there are plotholes that are huge enough you could drive a Death Star through it. Most of the humor felt too forced\\, though there were several lines that I thought were hilarious. Star Wars Rankings : OSB> ANH = RoTJ\\, > TFA\\, TLJ = RoTS > TPM > TCW","true":true}
