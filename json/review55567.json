Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not absolutely terrible\\, but hardly a good addition to Star Wars films.  I enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, loved Rogue One\\, and grew up with the original trilogy.   This film was 30 minutes too long\\, too focused on cheap laughs\\, and not only not live up to the hype\\, but failed to live up to the name Star Wars.  I expected to watch it a few times in the theater and dread if I have to sit through it again.","true":true}
