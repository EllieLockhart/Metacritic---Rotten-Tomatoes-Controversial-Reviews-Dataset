Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt in the Star Wars universe and at the time was surprised by new ideas. The Last Jedi abandons the most questionable theory underlying the first trilogy and the prelogy: the Force is not a matter of blood. And Luke Skywalker's reaction is a brilliant plot\\, it is wise as it is true. Visually it's a gold nugget and the actors are at the top of their game.","true":true}
