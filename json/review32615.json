Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is an excellent movie. I would definitely recommend seeing it. I don't want to give anything away in the review.  A lot of awe moments\\, was a wild roller coaster ride. It did  leave me with more questions then answers on some subjects leaving me wanting to see the next episode right away can't wait for episode 9. I am going to see episode 8 again this opening weekend just to be able to take the whole Spectrum of the movie in at least one more time before I buy it. May the force be with you .","true":true}
