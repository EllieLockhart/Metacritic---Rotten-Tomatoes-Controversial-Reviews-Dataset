Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely disgusted and disappointed. I don\u2019t even know where to begin. Cheesy humor very generic feel to the entire movie. TFA was a good Star Wars movie but this was complete garbage! The only way to save this franchise is go to Gareth Edwards (rogue one director) and ask him how much it would take to save this franchise. So sad right now","true":true}
