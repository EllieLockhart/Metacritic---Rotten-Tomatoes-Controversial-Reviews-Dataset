Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie! To be honest I was really shocked by the mixed audience reviews. I loved the acting\\, the special effects\\, and the story. I also really enjoyed seeing it with my kids and when a surprising part happened we would exchange surprised looks with eachother. I felt so strongly about loving this movie I made sure to sign up to give a review which I never do. This is a must see in the theatres!","true":true}
