Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slightly below average? Lots of slapstick for no reason what so ever. The constant \\\"we are all going to do\\, oh wait a miracle\\, oh never mind we are still all going to die\\\" pace gets old really quick. A movie does need that many moments of anxiety to be good. I liked Ren and Reys development but that was about it. Lukes death was silly\\, could have just as easily not been a meditating hologram and just had Ren actually kill him and that would have brought more meaning and purpose to it. It is pretty unbelievable that Snoke a seemingly 100 year old bad guy has only been using the force for 20 or so years (according to how sith work). His death didn't bother me like it did some. The movie over all just sort of fell flat. It has its good moments sure\\, but at least an hour of unneeded film that could have been replaced by substance.","true":true}
