Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakes was a decent movie\\, and that is being generous but a horrible Star Wars movie; just a step up above Phantom Menace.  However\\, this movie is just complete garbage.  Star wars is dead until they scratch all this cash grabs and go for some new quality magic.  Story was horrible\\, as well as any of the characters attempt to be likable.  I'm all for true equality\\, but when its force fed\\, its not entertainment\\, its a speech.  Just rip it.","true":true}
