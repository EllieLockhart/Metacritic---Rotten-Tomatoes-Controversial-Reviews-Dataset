Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars to me has always been a space fantasy with hope and the triumph of good over evil as its centre. The latest movie didn't give me this image. It's utterly depressing and it crushes all my expectations into dust. I don't feel like its a Star Wars movie actually. It didn't transport me to a whimsical yet narmy universe but to a universe with a bleak future with no signs of the wonder and magic of the previous movies. And honestly? Some of the things they did with the force made no sense.","true":true}
