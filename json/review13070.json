Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know that I've ever had a more satisfying film experience in my life (thus far)\\, except maybe since watching the originals as a kid. But this time\\, I got to see it in the theater for the first time on opening night. To feel genuinely surprised as an audience member is a rare thing these days\\, and they managed to capture that mystery and wonder of Star Wars while also letting the franchise evolve and breathe and subvert expectations. It was a treat and a substantive meal at the same time and if it were playing at my local theater this afternoon I would kick off work to go buy a ticket instantly.","true":true}
