{"101487":193232,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(WARNING\\, NSFW) Luke Skywalker is supposed to balance the force; he's the one about whom all the prophecies are written\\, and his role in the original trilogy is left unfulfilled in order to find fulfillment in the final trilogy. Sure\\, he was going to die. But he was going to die fighting for the force\\, never giving up\\, and sacrificing himself for the greater good. He saw a spark of good in Vader and was willing to sacrifice himself to preserve that single spark. But in The Last Jedi\\, he perceives evil in his nephew and for a moment decides to kill him. The character of Luke Skywalker regresses in an unrealistic\\, unbelievable way totally foreign to the character's personality in the sequentially previous trilogy which eventually spawned the prequels. Put it this way: the prequels were all better than The Last Jedi\\, \\\"Har Har\\\" Binks and all. Rian Johnson wanted to take Star Wars in a new direction: bad. He was just like: \\\"Oh\\, the original Star Wars trilogy is a classic of cinema the world over? Let's take it in a new direction. Utter crap.\\\" In that\\, he was successful. Final word? Luke Skywalker was a galactic superhero on which young boys built an imaginary template of themselves. He was supposed to bow out with dignity; not emo-out after failing once in an uncharacteristic way\\, then fuck off to some fishwife planet to grope lizard titties and forget the force. The new Star Wars has been patently ruined by SJW politics\\, and anyone who sees this film should take it as a sign that this political trend is worse than toxic; it's offensively destructive. The Last Jedi is to Star Wars what the death star was to Alderaan. Sure\\, the visuals were good. But what's wrong with telling a good story--oh\\, you're trying to shoehorn in a bunch of contrived political messages? Star Wars is a post-terrestrial romp juxtaposing universal themes of good and evil\\, not an ephemerally centered political piece treading water inconsistently in regard to leftist political narratives. Don't even get me started on that stupid purple-haired abomination sent to chastise and insult masculine demographics.","true":true}
