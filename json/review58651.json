I have been waiting for this game for 7 years. I bought a PS4 pro and pre ordered the game just so I could play it at its maximum potential. I avoided any and all leaks so I could go in with a fresh mind. The first game was possibly my favourite game of all time. I loved every last minute of it. Every character felt real and grounded.

This games story was an insult to everything that made the first game so great. I at least gave it a 1 purely out of respect for the developers that worked so hard to make this game beautiful. But the story did away with everything that I once loved about this game. The true irony is that this attempt to force a so called progressive narrative has only served to alienate people and push them further away from a wanting a better more progressive future. This was a disservice to true representation in video games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
