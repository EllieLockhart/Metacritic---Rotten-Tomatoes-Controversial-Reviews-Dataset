Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. It was visually stunning and wonderfully scored by John Williams. It was not perfect but definitely did not have that prequel feel. I enjoyed the twists and turns and the ending blew me away.","true":true}
