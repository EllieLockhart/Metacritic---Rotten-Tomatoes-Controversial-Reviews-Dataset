Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"director Rian Johnson takes the helm this time in the never-ending space fantasy phenomenon filled with fascinating new mythos and clever humor\\n40 years since the franchise started and the universe is ever-expanding which opens up so many new possibilities for fans and potential new stories\\npicking up right where Episode 7 left off; Episode 8 starts with the First Order stomping down on the Resistance's fleet with almost no hope whatsoever even with General Leia Organa in command\\, Rey went off to Ach-Toh to locate Luke Skywalker\\, Finn has managed to survive the explosion of Starkiller Base and wants to get away from this ongoing struggle that seems unwinnable\\, and Kyo Ren wrestles with the dark side and the light under Snoke's leadership\\nRey hopes to find Luke whom went into exile after his new Jedi Academy fell and Kylo Ren betrayed him\\, now he feels he cannot teach any more wisdom of the Force even when Rey wants to learn what power actually lies inside her\\, there may actually be more to the Jedi's origins and the understanding of the what the Force can really do\\nThe First Order is almost gaining the upper hand this time around with Kylo Ren and General Hux depleting Resistance soldiers left and right\\, is there any hope left?
