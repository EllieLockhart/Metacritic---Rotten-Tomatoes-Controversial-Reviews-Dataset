Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a life long fan..... (but not a fan that still has action figures in the box or cares or reads fan theory\\, or books outside the movies) After the OK Force Awakens and the brilliant and original Rogue One\\, this is simply a dumpster fire that burns everything to the ground. \\n\\nHalf a star only for the visual feast and action sequences.... because how hard is that in a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
