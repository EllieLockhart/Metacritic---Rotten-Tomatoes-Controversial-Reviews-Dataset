Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I grew up on Star Wars. I was Luke Skywalker. We all were... and then some dooosh bag comes along and destroys everything that made the original great. This is what happens when MARKETING gets involved. Story telling is important - the story here failed - and FAILED BIGLY. What you did to Luke Skywalker is unforgivable. Mark Hamill said it best: \\\"If you'r looking to go watch this and recapture some of your youth... you're going to be disappointed\\\". There were a few good moments. The last scene where the little boy is pretending to be a Jedi... Ironic in hindsight.  Disney can suk it. I won't watch another star wars movie period.... and I'm not alone - hence the 'soft' Solo opening. Killed off Luke Skywalker\\, while at the same time\\, saving Leah from deep space explosion. SAD SAD SAD. Who wrote this garbage? Did someone actually get paid to write this? it's GARBAGE. On the upside\\, I appreciate the Phantom Menace just a wee bit more. Thank you for finally ending my SW addiction.","true":true}
