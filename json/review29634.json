Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson should not direct any more star wars movies. It's like he took Batman vs Superman and mixed it with phantom menace. Disney also put to much Disney into this. Not bad but not as hyped as it should be","true":true}
