This is not necessarily a game designed for open world fans; think of the open world as something like No More Heroes level\\, where it's just there but the gameplay moments outside of the open world are what is awesome\\, not the moments based around it. That is what sets Yakuza apart from GTA and in a world filled with the done-to-death GTA formula\\, it is a welcome change.\r\rYes\\, there are some limitations which appear in other Yakuza games too\\, such as moments of having to read plenty of text and just gameplay moments where you can tell this is not a AAA title. However\\, that is fine by me because the hilarity of the side missions gave me more fun than I've had with most AAA titles in recent memory.\r\rPlease support this franchise if you do enjoy the games; I'd love to see Yakuza start to get more much-needed attention.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
