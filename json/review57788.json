Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning (I don't think Star Wars has ever looked this good)\\, emotional (for several reasons)\\, funny without being over the top\\, and John Williams has done a great job once again. Some questions that have been around for the past couple years get answered. A couple characters have some amazing eye-opening moments. Some characters story goes a path most likely not anticipated but for this story\/trilogy is perfect (which is all that matters).\\nIt's a long movie and doesn't have dead spots\\, if anything\\, there is a ton and a half crammed into that 2.5 hours. It's truly a race from the beginning to the end both in the pacing and in the actual story. It picks up right after the events of Episode 7. In the past we didn't get to see the empire attack Yavin after the rebels destroyed the Death Star. Now we get to see how the First Order immediately responds to Starkiller base getting destroyed. It also picks up right on the cliff side when Rey was handing Luke his lightsaber. It's not like this movie is a sequel that takes place months or years later\\, it's more like\\, here is the next scene that is a matter of hours later. I didn't think the movie felt rushed\\, well\\, maybe just a bit at one spot\\, but it might be because of it being a first viewing and there is so much to take in. That being said\\, this movie has alot of substance and there will be alot to chew on and digest over several viewings.\\nIt ends in a way that there will only be a couple questions going into Episode 9 and it sets up that movie to be a clean slate finale to the trilogy\\, meaning nothing is really lingering to be wrapped up in the next film with the exception of the main characters story. A lot gets wrapped up in this chapter.\\nI loved it\\, this is a great Star Wars movie\\, and I would easily put it up very close to the top of the list. It's a perfect next chapter in \\\"THIS\\\" star wars saga\\, which is important\\, Visually it's #1. Knowing now how Rian Johnson handled this film\\, I am really looking forward to his new trilogy that Lucasfilm\/Disney gave him control to create\\, and this movie is the reason they game it to him.","true":true}
