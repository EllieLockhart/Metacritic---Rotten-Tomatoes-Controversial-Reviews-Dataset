Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boo boo\\, the movie wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be\\, so I'm gonna get on the internet and give it a 1\/2 Star\\, because my opinion is so important. \\n\\nIt was a Star Wars movie\\, and it was entertaining. I personally can't wait for episode 9.","true":true}
