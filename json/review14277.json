Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the people who came here to complain about \\\"SJW propaganda.\\\" Look at what all the critics and the majority of people say. If they were truly honest\\, they would be complaining about the commentary in the originals too. While there are some flaws\\, (Canto Bight)\\, in the end it's a well acted\\, worthy addition to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
