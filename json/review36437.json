Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most honest review that I have heard and said aloud is that \\\"I don't know how to feel about The Last Jedi!\\\" As a die hard Star Wars fan I find this film to be a complete departure from what we know and love. As a die hard fan of cinema I truly appreciate the daring steps the film takes to do something different. The Last Jedi takes a look at the inner struggle to find ones true self and shows us the Dark Side in ways we had always asked for. At times the humor that's inserted is just unnecessary but overall The Last Jedi is a bold and welcome new look at the Star Wars universe!","true":true}
