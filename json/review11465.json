Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie from the first scene to the last. 1st scene has one guy vs 2000 ships and he obviously manages to kill them all and return safely to his ship? The way snoke dies is ridiculous... Lea becomes superman in the middle of the movie? and yoda reappears randomly...very dissapointed. Disney is ruining the franchise","true":true}
