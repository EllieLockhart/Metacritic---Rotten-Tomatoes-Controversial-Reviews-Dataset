Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(SPOILERS AHEAD) Seriously guys\\, don't worry about all the whiney man-children giving 1 stars. I respect valid criticism\\, but it's all just crap like \\\"how did luke just disappear?!?!?!?!\\\" you know\\, like yoda did. In Empire. Or \\\"how did Leia fly back into the ship?!?!?!\\\" you know\\, like a basic force pull. In a vacuum. With no other forces (haha) acting upon her. Basically people who have apparently never seen a piece of star wars media.","true":true}
