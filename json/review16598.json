Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible film. Don't go in hoping for your fan fiction to come true (like many of these audience reviews apparently) because this movie will upend your expectations. It pushes the series forward and out of the \\\"safe\\\" murk it's been stuck in somewhat lately. This is the rare film that you know when you see it that people 20 years from now will wonder what \\\"fans\\\" could possibly have been thinking when they were outraged over this.","true":true}
