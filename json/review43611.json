Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not what we were waiting for..\\nThe movie is beautiful made. The effects are amazing!\\nBut!! too many jokes.. is almost a comedy. \\nToo many characters (useless characters) Like Rose\/DJ\/Finn\\nOver 30 years my childrens will be not talking about this movie like im talking about the first 3.\\nThe prequels had at least a history to tell.. on this one after 2 movies you still have no clue. Star Wars doesnt need to go this direction.. i a shame.\\nOnly a wonder can save the galaxy... Rian & Disney thanks! i had a lot of hope but now im totally dissapointed.","true":true}
