Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well the action scenes were great but apparently the director doesn't understand what makes Star Wars great. It seemed like he did everything possible to leave fans feeling empty when leaving the theatre. JJ Abram's The Force Awakens was flawed in that it was too similar to A New Hope but it felt like a Star Wars movie and it left fans thinking about all the cool mysteries like who is Rey and Snoke? What's up with Luke? If you go into this movie expecting clever answers to these questions\\, expect to be majorly disappointed. It's a shame we have waited so long for Star Wars to return. Now Rian Johnson has crapped all over it. Perhaps if Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy had mapped out the trilogy plot when they started instead of just winging it as they go\\, we wouldn't have this mess. Hard to imagine when you think about it that they would take such a beloved franchise and half-ass it. But they did. Cash grab.","true":true}
