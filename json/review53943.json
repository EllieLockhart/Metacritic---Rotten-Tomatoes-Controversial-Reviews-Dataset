Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually signed up on Rotten Tomatoes to give this movie a review. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than \\\"The Room\\\". Yeah\\, that bad. I grew up on SW. I love the saga but this is terrible. It's offensive to fans and viewers. A clear sign that Disney doesn't have a handle on anything in the SW universe and that they're finding directors like Rian and Jar Jar Abrams to write fan fiction movies. This is a movie that's meant to entertain\\, not have a political agenda. I don't have the time to give every reason why this movie is bad and I don't want to give any spoilers but this is terrible. Check out some YouTube posts if you want some peoples' opinions. There are some good videos out there. Videos that are LIGHT-YEARS better than this hunk of crap. wait till Blu-ray. Yep.","true":true}
