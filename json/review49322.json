Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie to date\\, although I wasn't to keen on what JJ did with a lot of the plot holes and copy and paste tactic\\, Rian had the opportunity to make this an awesome movie and didn't take it.  \\nMr. Rian gave a big middle finger to JJ and the fans\\, and I think he should never touch another star wars movie the rest of his career how ever lon g that may be.","true":true}
