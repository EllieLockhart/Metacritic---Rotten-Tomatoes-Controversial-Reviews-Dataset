We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First and foremost\\, I dont give two donkey turds what your political or social beliefs are. Second\\, I have played the game from beginning to end. I have been gaming since I had been given a hand me down Atari which was around the early 80s I believe. With that being said\\, on to my personal review of this game. The graphics were impressive. I loved the environment and the lighting that was used through out. It gave a very \\\"dirty\\\" look in certain terrains and textures. The sound was very good. Playing with headphones really makes every sound seem like it's right next to you. Now on to the plot or story of the game\\, simply put\\, I thought it was stupid. I mean\\, how do you let someone who killed a person that was like a father figure to you go at the end on the basis of \\\"There has been enough killing\\\"? Seriously??? Didnt we just spend over 30 hours sneak killing some people and some dogs just to progress? Oh but we are meant to believe that right when you have the person (Abby) at your mercy and are about ready to Fallout some justified vengeance\\, you have an epiphany and let her go. If Naughty Dog only spent more time on the story board than pandering to woke agenda my personal review would be higher. And yes I would have scored this a little higher but I admit that Neil Druckmann's online behavior and lack of acceptance of criticism may have influenced my scoring in this game. That and the fact that most places (gamestop) are not accepting returns as of this time. If you ate curious about this game\\, borrow it from a friend. Dont waste your money on this. It's really not worth it. Or wait for it to be on sale like 19.99 or lower.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
