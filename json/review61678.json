We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Short review save your money\\, don't buy\rStory 3\/10\\, Characters 4\/10\\, Gameplay 7\/10\\, Graphics 10\/10\r\rFor game that's heavily based on story narrative\\, it is filled with plot holes and moronic decisions. Spoiler but if you were looking for an Ellie and Joel team play you will be sorry. Not only does Ellie and Joel not interact with each other but Joel dies 2 hours into the game by a new protagonist Abby. In which the game makes you play 14 hours as this character trying to make you feel sympathetic\\, how can you feel sympathetic when Joel saved Abby's life from a horde of Clickers only to be brutally murdered at abbys hands but it's okay it's a Revenge story remember\\, you know that you're going to kill Abby in the end right. Well you would be wrong not only do you not get a choice to kill her but after killing hundreds if not thousands of people to get to her at the very end you get an epiphany that you shouldn't kill her because revenge is bad. And that's just a story.\r\rCharacters are bland two dimensional personality\\, there was little to no character development at all. This was a real disappointment considering ln The Last of Us 1 had a lot of character building it really put you into the story made you feel immersed into the environment when the protagonist was hurt you felt it when the protagonist was feeling Joy you felt it. This game however felt as if it was trying way too hard to achieve something that was just not there. It has left me more angry and frustrated then any other emotion.\r\rGameplay was better than the last of us 1 however due to the story I just could not enjoy it and is why my score for gameplay is 7 out of 10\\, there's nothing really overly new besides two new enemies and a jump mechanic that's laughably horrible.\r\rGraphics are the only selling point I could give this game\\, it looks absolutely amazing seeing how the world being overtaken by Nature is just jaw dropping and can be arguably next gen graphics or the absolute pinnacle of PlayStation 4.\r\rOverall I feel like this game is a complete failure narrative wise. Gameplay was niche but not enjoyable. Characters Hollow and unlikable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
