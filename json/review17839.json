Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had its flaws\\, but I personally felt like this was a natural addition to the new trilogy. It complemented The Force Awakens rather than throwing it out like Attack of the Clones did to The Phantom Menace. The heroes of the Resistance were in a tight spot\\, being chased down by The First Order\\, just barely hanging on by a thread...meanwhile\\, our Force-sensitive hero is off trying to get The Last Jedi to come and bring hope to the Resistance when they need it the most. Lots of similarities to Empire without being an overt copy. Makes me excited for the third installment.","true":true}
