Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is deceptive about what is happening in the film and that is why it has failed to impress audiences with it's ultimately pointless subplots. It was a refreshing look at the franchise and if it wasn't full of gotcha moments it would have been not only delivered properly but accepted by the general audience. The movie runs like a well done simple magic trick with obvious slight of hand to not frighten the audience in the twists presented. The simple solutions to highly complex problems that Star Wars is known for was tested and enjoyable to see our \\\"heroes\\\" fail but despite the gross failure they live suspending belief. The chances taken and the sacrifices are muted by the nameless off camera deaths\\, death of a new character we don't connect with\\, betrayal of a character we don't connect with\\, and a forced love angle we recognize from Episode II or maybe more like from Swimfan. The film is tolerable and has few moments that are very memorable also leaving a cliffhanger that seems impossible to pick up from for the next installment. The actors are the best and worst parts of the film making me enjoy the ride at the same time being registering as annoying which is good acting for the character types presented. Though Rian changed Star Wars for a net positive\\, hence my three stars\\, he simultaneously made continuing the franchise trepidatious for fans.","true":true}
