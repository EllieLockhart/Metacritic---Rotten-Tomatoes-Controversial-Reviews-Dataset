Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move is both terribly written\\, with a plot threads that make no sense. But it also does nothing for the new trilogy\\, except to kill off characters and make it impossible to have a coherent Trilogy. I really don't understand what the story group is doing. Or why they hired a incompetent director.","true":true}
