Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game dives deep into the world of black and white through imagery like no other. The greatest part of The Last of US Part 2 is its vulnerability. It allows the gamer to immerse themselves into a game that is much more than a revenge story. We're brought into a game where we learn that there aren't \\\"good guys and bad guys\\,\\\" instead we see that every individual in the game has a story in which they're the good guy. For example\\, every NPC has a name they're referred to\\, to further express the concept that each person is in fact a human who may believe that their actions benefit the greater cause. Moving on\\, we see Ellie\\, who has reacted like a moth to a flame by hunting down Abby\\, evolve to finally forgive Joel and herself. In doing so\\, she overcomes this blind rage\\, reflecting on what she has lost along the way. Instead of choosing to move on initially\\, she's given up much more than losing Joel: a family\\, friends\\, her fingers that inhibit playing a song that holds significance. The game conquers a bleak concept of two people living happily ever after and creates a refreshing story that shocks and provides values in which we all can learn from. Empathy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
