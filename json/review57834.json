Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was waiting to see this movie and dissappointed...film \\,cgi\\,music \\,were all awesome except stoty line ...luke has no real impact except decoy at the end ... po just an idiot piolt gunner cant seem to guess right..fin just the funny guy with no point ...rae some how learns everything she needs in 2 days and becomes a master at it.... kylo still just throws his temper tantrums and can't beat rae even tho he's been trained by luke and the supreme leader..... leah can't die even after being blown into space and now she can use the force somehow... there lots more but u tell me what else is bad about it..","true":true}
