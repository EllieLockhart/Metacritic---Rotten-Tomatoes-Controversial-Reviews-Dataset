Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long and unnecessary. So many weird side missions that came to nothing but a sore bum. In an attempt to make the dialogue urgent insteqadq it was sappy and purposeless. So many things I should have cared about but after more than 2 and a half hours I barely flinched. Visually beautiful as always\\, but the Disney crutch of popping a joke in to move the scene along was overwrought and ham fisted.\\nI'll still see it again though.","true":true}
