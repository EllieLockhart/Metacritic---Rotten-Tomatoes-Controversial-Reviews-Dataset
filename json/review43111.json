Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This one definitely subverts expectations in a way that feels natural.  There is only one moment in mind this doesn't feel quiet right to me but other than that\\, I enjoyed the ride and am curios in how this trilogy will wrap up.","true":true}
