Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is hands down the worst star wars movie ever made\\, I cant even begin to describe how bad it is you would basically have to watch it to see the problems which i cant recommend anyone to even go to a theater for $5 Tuesdays to see this garbage\\, Disney clearly wanted to make a quick buck and didn't care about the quality of this product at all. the Dialogue is horrendous\\, the plot pointless\\, even the villain serves virtually no purpose\\, and the constant use of word rebel doesn't mean cool misfits just cause you say it every 30 seconds in this film.\\nplease pull this from the theater and remake the whole thing dont  make this cannon.","true":true}
