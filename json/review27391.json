Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of all the recent Star Wars movies this one was my most anticipated. Ok the Force Awakens might have just rehashed the Episode 4 story but it put the fun and adventure back into series and gloriously built up to the moment where The Last Jedi begins. Oh ok the start of the movie was crap. The middle of the movie was crap and yep the end of the movie was crap too\\, for all the reasons the other audience reviews have mentioned over and over. I so wanted to like this movie but it's crap - total crap with exception of the mighty fine visual effects. It's such a dog it just might kill the whole Star Wars series completely.","true":true}
