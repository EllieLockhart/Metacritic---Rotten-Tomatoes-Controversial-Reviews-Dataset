Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Just horrible. \\n\\nHave you heard of this force user\\, Rey? Within hours of learning about the Force\\, Rey will have unparralled mind control capabilities. She will pick up a lightsaber for the first time in her life and will proceed to overpower and defeat an adept Force user trained for years by the wisest living light and dark Force users in the galaxy. Then she will track Luke down on a remote island to pester him about giving her guidance. If he refuses\\, she will wait until he turns his back on her and start beating him with a stick. She might also try to flirt with his murderous nephew or pull a lightsaber on him if she gets angry. Then she will confront Superme Leader Snoke's personal guard and easily dispatch them before using the Force to lift objest in a manner Luke or Anakin never could. She will also know how to swim like Michael Phelps despite living on a desert planet her whole life. Also\\, she will fly the Millenium Falcon better than Han ever could. I don't know where her powers come from seeing as her parents are just a common pair of drunks. They weren't good parents but Rey might be a good friend.","true":true}
