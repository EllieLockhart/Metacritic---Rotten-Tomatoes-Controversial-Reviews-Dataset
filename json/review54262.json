Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely find how Episode VIII has affected people fascinating. I felt the film had almost no filler at all and I was engrossed the whole way through. I loved it. It's very rare that a film has that effect on me.\\n\\nI think\\, then\\, that the reason this film affected people so runs deeper: I think this film destroyed many people's conclusions from the original trilogy - and they dislike it for that. For me\\, however\\, Luke's mentality and the way the Force was portrayed 'made sense'. I thought the way Luke fought Ren at the end was a representation of the nature of the Force itself: Luke was completely passive (he wasn't even there) while Ren let his own hatred and passion thwart his own plans by aggressively flailing around at nothing. This was a victory of Light over Dark and I believe Luke did it to save his friends and teach Ren a lesson about how the Dark side clouds judgement. The philosophy in the film stayed very faithful to the originals for me and I loved it for that.","true":true}
