Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So first off\\, this movie is too long. The best scene (and for me the emotional climax) happens and then there's still at least 30 minutes left in the movie. There are plenty of things I liked in this movie\\, but at the end of the day I just didn't have the same emotional connection with this that I did with Force Awakens. There are several plot elements that I wasn't a big fan of. Too much forced humor. I think Ray is a really interesting character and I liked her parts the best\\, but not until after she got off the island. I want to see it again to see if my opinion of it changes\\, but on first viewing I was a little disappointed.","true":true}
