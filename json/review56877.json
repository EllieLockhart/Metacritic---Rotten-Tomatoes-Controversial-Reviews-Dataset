Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's been a lot of hate on this film from the fan base about how it's not reminiscence of the old films; but I'm sure there are fans who also loved watching this new chapter in the series.  I enjoyed this film and was amazed at the fresh story and new adventure this series is turning onto.  Gone are the stereotypical archetypes of good and evil (another evil Emperor who is just evil because....evil. Boring)\\, we are shown that these new Force Awakens characters are all conflicted and broken. \\nPeople keep comparing it to the original trilogy but honestly who wants to watch a remake of Empire Strikes Back a la Force Awakens and A New Hope\\, if I wanted to enjoy the originals again I would just watch Empire; we want to see a new fresh adventure with interesting characters and The Last Jedi delivers.","true":true}
