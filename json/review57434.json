Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was beautifully recorded and not only me was hoping for a different type of movie\\, just like Luke said \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\"\\, but when I saw the first 20 minutes of the movies I not only thought that this wasn't Star Wars anymore but this wasn't a great movie either\\, nice escenes but poor script at one moment I felt like I was watching a comedy movie from a bad director but this was a big production \\\"how could this feel like that?\\\" I asked myself\\, and it felt more like they were trying to change everything even if it's not logical or entertaining than they trying to do one of the biggest movies of this generation\\, the characters felt lazy added and the fact that most of the movie happens between a fight that it's supposed to last no more than 20 minutes was ridiculous for a great company like Disney\\, the introduction of some characters were sadly lame and the moments of \\\"this character it's dying... Sike! It's alive\\\" were more than absurd\\, I think we all should agree that this could be a great movie without being a cliche but making a better storytelling than they did\\, it could have a better script than the forgivable lanes they had and giving it a more heart to the story rather than making a toy seller movie that teenager should understand as a new Power Ranger Movie\\, the original trilogy had some issues and it wasn't perfect but they managed to give us a story that can't compare to the new one\\, I personally didn't like The Force Awakens that much and it was the least liked movie of Star Wars I've seen but this was even worse\\, it was like a punch in the heart and I went to my house in shock and sad about the things they did to a lot years of work\\, but now I've watched it some times more I agree it's at the level of some Scooby Doo live action movie and it's not hurtful but hilariously dumb\\, good job Disney you wanted to kill the old saga making legends not cannon and killing all the joy and great moments we all had and remember from decades making a parody of the whole saga? you did it.","true":true}
