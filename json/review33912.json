Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible Star Wars movie. Just a bunch of terribly timed jokes\\, pointless side stories that went nowhere\\, characters that offered nothing to the storyline\\, countless plot holes\\, and much much more. I am a huge Star Wars fan and this movie was so hard to watch because it was not a Star Wars movie. Thanks Rian Johnson for ruining an otherwise amazing saga.","true":true}
