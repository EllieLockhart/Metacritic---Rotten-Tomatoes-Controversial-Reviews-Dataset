Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does it fuck up the lore ? Yes. Does it ruin Luke ? Kind of. Does it slap you on the face for being hyped up about the things The Force Awakens hyped up itself ? Yes it does. Does it have plot holes and tonal inconsistencies ? Yes it does. But since it is a very competently made\\, well shot\\, well choreographed spectacle that is enjoyable\\, it gets a 3\/5.which to me means it is above average but nothing to write home about.","true":true}
