Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a stellar Star Wars film that is about more than just laser sword fights and laser gun fights. The humor also worked\\, and my kids were bouncing in their seats during the funnier parts of the film. My only beef is that some parts looked a little too much like our earth\\, which was a mistake of the prequels. Of course\\, many parts were simply alien\\, and outstanding at that.","true":true}
