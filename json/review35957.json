Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi meets the quotas of a tolerable sci-fi movie but fails as a Star Wars film.\\n\\nRian Johnson never delivers on the foreshadowed plots left behind in The Force Awakens and discards it all together\\, ruining the established lore and characters in the process.\\n\\nThe movie is Star Wars fanfiction\\, almost as if the writer\/director had a script for something else and decided to cram it into The Last Jedi.\\n\\nCharacter development was regressive or nonexistent. Even Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo is unchanged by the end of the movie\\, shocking considering the amount of screentime that was afforded on him. Waste.\\n\\nMovie is crammed with a lot of unneeded filler which should have been filled by something that was needed.\\n\\nCharacters are hardly believable as human beings\\, something that was there in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nHollow story and jarring editing\\, but great visuals and effects.","true":true}
