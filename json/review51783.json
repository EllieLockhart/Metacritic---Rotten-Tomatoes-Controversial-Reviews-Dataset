{"101487":99302,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Admittedly this is the only film review I have written to date\\, but this is not a 'fake account' - I have just never felt so strongly about a film before. This is because this isn't just a bad film. It's not even a bad film in a franchise. It's a bad film which does serious damage to the franchise it is part of.\\n\\nThe first major complaint is that we still don't really understand what the situation in the Galaxy is\\, and this makes it hard to become absorbed in the film. The First Order are supposed to be the remaining die-hard supporters of the Emperor who have been banished to a remote part of the Galaxy\\, yet they seem to have more resources than the Empire when they ran the entire galaxy. The 'resistance' are the military of the New Republic who until recently had the resources of the galaxy at their disposal\\, yet seem less well equipped than the Rebellion of the originals. We also don't see assimilation of Imperial technology by the New Republic which is odd. Although the Force Awakens is responsible for getting the franchise into this situation\\, the situation was not irrecoverable. Had it transpired in this film that the First Order had put all (or most) of their eggs in one basket with the Star Killer base and that the rest of the New Republic's military were just in the wrong place at the wrong time\\, then it could have all made sense. However\\, this film just digs the franchise deeper into the hole. The very first sentence of the opening crawl states that the First Order reign\\, but this isn't a logical development from TFA - or at least we've missed some crucial events in the story which the opening crawl should have alluded to. Later on\\, the opening crawl even contradicts itself by talking of a rising tyranny. Are the First Order ascending\\, or are they ascendant? How come the First Order are so powerful and the New Republic so weak? If you're expecting answers to these questions\\, then your expectations will be subverted.\\n\\nThe second major complaint is the vandalism of the Star Wars universe. A lot of what happens in Star Wars doesn't make any sense in terms of laws of physics\\, but there are rules which were already well established in Episode 4. These rules may have been subsequently embellished\\, but they were never broken and this is crucial for a suspension of disbelief. With this film\\, we see the arbitrary introduction of new Jedi powers\\, and the weponisation of the jump to light speed which effectively invalidates every major space battle which has gone before it. Not only does these moments of Deus ex Machina prevent suspension of disbelief in a way which pulls you out of the movie\\, they also introduce inconsistencies with other Star Wars films.\\n\\nOther things pull you out of the movie too - badly timed jokes which ruin any tension\\, sub-plots which go nowhere\\, contrived situations and so many 'gotcha'\\, double-gotcha and triple-gotcha moments that it just becomes tedious. \\nThese are only the things which make this movie objectively terrible. There are then many other aspects to this movie - especially relating to how characters are treated\\, portrayed or behave which are divisive at best.\\n\\nOverall\\, I have a lot of difficulty rating this film - it is visually stunning\\, the score is fantastic and it looks like a lot of talented people have put a lot of effort into it. Unfortunately\\, it's just let down by the story - the overall narrative hangs so loosely that the movie just feels like you're watching a 5 year old playing with their toys. Worse still\\, the damage this film does oozes into the wider franchise.","true":true}
