Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Conflicting movie\\, I want to love it\\, but I just can't. If Force Awaken left audiences and fans debating\\, speculating and engaged in what's to come\\, TLJ will only be discussed on what did Disney do to Star Wars and who is the better director.  It's a real shame\\, as I'm not interested or excited for episode 9 at all.","true":true}
