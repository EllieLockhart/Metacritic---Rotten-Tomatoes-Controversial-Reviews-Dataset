Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an objectively bad\\, at times ridiculous\\, movie. Those giving it positive reviews seem to:\\n1) Be shilling for Disney\\, or\\n2) Believe it somehow validates their political views\\, or\\n3) Most tragically\\, be otherwise good people who are suffering the Phantom Menace syndrome\\, trying to convince themselves that this wasn't awful.\\n\\nThe arrogance of Rian Johnson is astounding. He trashed everything that came before him in one of the most beloved entertainment franchises of the last 40 years. And this guy hadn't exactly established himself as a visionary titan who had earned the right beforehand.\\n\\nThis will age even worse than the Prequels.","true":true}
