Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're going into this movie thinking you'll be transported back to 1980 for another round of Empire\\, you are going to be extremely disappointed...and as we all know fans and people in general DO NOT like change.  Especially when it's beloved characters that we have been intertwined with for all of our lives.  When the status quo gets dumped over the side of a cliff like an old lightsaber in the very beginning\\, most if not all\\, true fans will get dumped right along with it.  I have to admit that I too was looking back to the past and \\\"hoping\\\" for a tried and true\\, safe\\, clean fight where good always wins over evil...but a long time ago and even today life doesn't always work that way.  This movie takes everything safe and predictable and sets it on fire...but the lessons are the same...teamwork\\, faith in yourself\\, trust\\, doing the right thing and most importantly hope.      In a world where everyone seems to be exceptional and gifted you finally discover that they're just like everyone else...broken\\, confused\\, afraid...human.  That greatness can come from anywhere and anyone.  For most people who go to the movie to escape reality for a little while\\, this may not be the movie you're looking for.  This movie will spin you in a million different directions with new perspectives and major surprises...for those with an open mind.  For those looking for status quo...you better buy a ticket to Justice League.","true":true}
