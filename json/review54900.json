Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's great to see the narrative finally move forward.  It's great to see some Luke develop in to a flawed hero.  This film has some flaws but my high rating comes from how excited I am to finally have someone do something new and exciting with a franchise that has grown more than a little stagnant.","true":true}
