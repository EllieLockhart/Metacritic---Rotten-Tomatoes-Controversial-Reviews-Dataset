Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has some amazing visuals and sound editing. It is entertaining to watch and see all the pretty shots and glamour. When you look past this initial glow\\, you quickly realize that there is not much substance here. There are plot holes everywhere\\, even ones specific to Star Wars lore and rules. This is very jarring and disrupts any immersion you may have in the movie. There is no real worldbuilding and things are stated or depicted a certain way because that is what the director wanted. The characters are lackluster\\, with no real development that actually matters in the end. Rey is the worst of all the characters because she has no real motivation or purpose\\, no real flaws\\, no real danger\\, and can do anything and everything she wants to do\\, no matter is she has any training\\, knowledge\\, or experience in the area. She is utterly boring. It is a fun space movie with the name \\\"Star Wars\\\" slapped onto it. It betrays all the old material and all the dynamic characters and stories that came before it.","true":true}
