Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half a star is to many for this awfull movie\\,  the director destroyed the starwars mythology\\, he made a mockery of what could have been a good movie especially the way the last director gave him an ally oopp for a great movie and rian  johnson just shit his pants and fucked up every good opportunity he had to make this movie great\\, this movie will be the beginning of the end to a once great franchise.","true":true}
