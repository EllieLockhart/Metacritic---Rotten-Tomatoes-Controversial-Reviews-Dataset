Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is a total disgrace to the fans of Star Wars. they make Luke how to be some crazy coot the movie drags throughout there is no plot development. we barely care for the actresses and actors in the movie. it is pretty much a big middle finger to the fans and JJ Abrams. I am boycotting episode 9 because of what they did to Luke in this movie. awful awful awful is all I can say","true":true}
