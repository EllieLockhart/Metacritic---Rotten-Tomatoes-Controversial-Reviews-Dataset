Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to review this pile of dung movie. Only good thing about this movie is it has nice special effects. Other than that.....it's just terrible. No direction whatsoever. Just \\\"rebels\\\" running in slow motion away from the first order. I wonder why Mark Hamill even agreed to make this movie. They made Luke just sad. Kylo is a moron. Rey is likable enough. No taking anything from Awakens and carrying it on. This was the absolute worst way you could have made this movie. Leia in the vacuum of space gliding back to her ship was garbage. I was in shock almost the entire time watching this. I have seen every star wars movie and well\\, was a fan. I simply don't know what to say. I honestly don't think you could've tried to make a star wars movie worse than this. I'm not mad. Just surprised that there are people out there who actually liked this movie. I have no idea why if they were a previous star wars fan. That's the most shocking part of all. Maybe they didn't read any of the books. I wonder what George Lucas is really thinking. I don't think I will go see another one. The franchise died for me with this movie.","true":true}
