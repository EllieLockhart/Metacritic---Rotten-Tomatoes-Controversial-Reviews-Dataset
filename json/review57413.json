Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing. Anyone who thinks this movie was horrible must not have saw the same movie...people criticize the force awakens for having the same plot as new hope and that it\u0092s too similar so now we get something new and excited but with familiar parts and themes that a Star Wars movie must have. Every part of the Rey kylo Luke snoke plot was perfection and the Poe and Leia story line was great as well each character had a flaws but realized what they had to do in the end kylo realized he had to let go of his conflict and become the ruler Rey realized that even though her parents aren\u0092t there for her she isn\u0092t alone and luke realized he can\u0092t abandon hope and his friends and family everything comes together beautifully and the action scenes are great... everything new they did with the force was awesome to see a new side of the force and it\u0092s expanding powers. The only real problem in the movie is the weird animal chase scene with Finn and rose. I liked the new characters DJ was cool even though he was just out for some cash. The jokes for me worked and luke was classic cocky cry baby luke that had some funny moments and that\u0092s ok. Overall this movie was great and I\u0092d watch it 1928271 more times before I watched any prequel and dare I say this is as good as a Star Wars movie as empire. I think I will... 9.8\/10","true":true}
