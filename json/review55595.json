Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not getting where all the positive fanfare is generating from. Paid advertising via PR firms and the film industry? New jack fans with no attachments to the original\\, unedited trilogy? Hard to say. Having successfully avoided all the trailers and spoilers\\, went into this \\\"blockbuster\\\"  with a blank slate of expectations\\, wanting very much to love it. Instead\\, walked away crossed in disappointment with that bad feeling in the mouth one gets when they feel they've been cheated. What a missed opportunity. A missed opportunity to give Hamill the role of a lifetime\\, a missed opportunity to push the potentials stand alone film Rogue One delivered on. The magic is gone. The whole Finn\/Rose\/Del-Toro story-line was  pointless. An eyesore of a flat CGI snooze fest. A waste of valuable screen time. The Rose character is a disposable throwaway casting of Jar Jar proportions. Laura Dern's character didn't fare much better. \\n\\nGreat seeing Hamill return in any capacity and the Throne Room scene was decent enough but ultimately\\, this was a squandered opportunity to do the Franchise justice. Rian Johnson is a joke. It's a shame Gareth Edwards was not signed up to direct these new installments. \\n\\nR.I.P Star Wars","true":true}
