Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walking out of the cinema\\, I initially didn't think this movie too bad\\, I mean it had a few good scenes and was set in space. However\\, it didn't take long for me to realise how very bad this film was. It's all good and well making a film in space\\, but if you're going to exist within the Star Wars universe\\, then it needs to be consistent with past films. This film gladly discards all of that\\, and though it may (at best) provide for a cheap laugh\\, it carries no weight. This film has no substance. This film will suffer a worst fate than the prequels.","true":true}
