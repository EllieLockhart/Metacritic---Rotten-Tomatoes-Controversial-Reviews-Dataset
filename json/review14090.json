Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're looking for the well trodden path to confirm your pet theories\\, maybe this isn't the movie for you. Its way deeper than the complainers give it credit for though. There is a lot of subtle symbolism and many people who are under the curve aren't getting it the first watch.","true":true}
