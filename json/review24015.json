Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were the worst part of this movie\\, dry\\, monotone and lifeless\\, not to mention the comedy was pushed too hard and almost gratuitous at times.  Not worth seeing a second time\\, ever!","true":true}
