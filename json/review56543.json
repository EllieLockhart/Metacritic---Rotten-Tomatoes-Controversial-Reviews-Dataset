Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi gave us its story in a nutshell in the trailers leading up to its release. It's about \\\"balance\\,\\\" \\\"letting the past die\\\" (originals)\\, \\\"I'm no one.\\\" and more.\\n\\nIf you are looking for something that resembles the original trilogy\\, then you will be sorely disappointed. This has the look and feel of Star Wars and it even grabbed some stuff from Empire. But Rian Johnson and his team took risks with the story and the characters. \\n\\n It's getting really tiring seeing so many people mad because (pun intended) \\\"this didn't go the way you wanted it to.\\\" Franchises like Star Wars are made for fans but not made by fans. Accept the story that Rian Johnson and Lucasfilm started with a new set of characters in The Force Awakens and believe in that. If Last Jedi showed us anything\\, it's that we are living in a new trilogy\\, not the past. This isn't the Skywalker saga. This is the story of Rey\\, Kylo and Poe.\\n\\nThere are some flat out dumb\\, questionable moments (cough\\, Super Leia) but not enough missteps that squash the story it tells and the direction we're heading into with Ep 9.\\n\\nVisually\\, the movie is stunning. Hamill's performance is great\\, utilizing his knowledge and grace as Luke as well as his funny\\, witty side from his other projects throughout his career.\\n\\nAnyone reading this review\\, all I can say is go into this movie\\, knowing that this is not a movie about Luke. It's not a movie trying to emulate any of the original movies.\\n\\nIt establishes this trilogy as a new trilogy\\, separate and on its own two feet. So many di-hard fans complained that The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope. And now\\, so many are complaining because it is too different from the originals. George Lucas said he liked this. And I think that's because Johnson did what he would've done\\, which was make something different.\\n\\nAnd if the creator likes it\\, I think we all should too.\\n\\n4\/5","true":true}
