Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Removed my entire review just to say this was bad. Forget an explanation this doesn't deserve it. The fan reviews and videos have covered it.\\n\\nWhen I left this review the fan score was 67%. It's now 49%. It's a majority! \\n\\nAnd another bunch of critics got PAID because its jumped from a shocking 90% to an even more shocking 91%. \\n\\nConclusion: When you blow 300 mil on a movie and you need your money back. \\n\\nThey dont deserve their jobs.","true":true}
