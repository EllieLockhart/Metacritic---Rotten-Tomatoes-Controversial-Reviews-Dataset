Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was the purpose of this movie. How has the story line from the Last Jedi moved anything along. Most of the humour seemed forced and there was no character developement. What a shame... I\u2019ll give you a pass on this one but maybe someone could spend some money on a script and story line for the next one... or I will wait until I can rent it at home for any future Star Wars movies. Dissapointed is the nicest thing I could say...","true":true}
