Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes\\, lack of a cohesive story between episode 7 and 8\\, quite a bit of filler scenes that did nothing to progress the story\\, and a cast of characters that have been interesting at times but underdeveloped overall.  What somewhat saves the movie\\, are the spectacular visuals and great space battles.  While it is enjoyable\\, I think a mess has been created for JJ Abrams to conclude the trilogy in a way that is meaningful and interesting.","true":true}
