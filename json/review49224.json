Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst Star Wars movie i ever saw!\\ni'm a big star wars fan but this film was awful.\\nyou could see Disney in every second scene. the film lookslike Rian Johnson is not a fan and he ignored every thing you liked at star wars .","true":true}
