Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst movie on its own merits\\, but very destructive to the Star Wars story.  So many important elements and characters of the universe thrown away unceremoniously.  Even these main characters\\, which were developed in the last movie\\, came out thinner and less developed than they started.  Don't get me started on the in-your-face liberal politics and irrelevant social commentary.  This movie will certainly not age well.","true":true}
