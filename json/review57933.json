Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What comes as the most disappointing Star Wars movie to date. What happens in the movie and to the characters is fine\\, but how it is done is not accurate and any true Star Wars fan is going to feel cheated. No matter how poorly a Star Wars film has been in the past each one has done at least one thing\\, and that one thing is building character and progressing a story. Rey is still the same and even more so the Mary Sue she was at the end of the Force Awakens. Kylo is still an angry child\/adult\\, Luke has no character resemblance to Luke from the original trilogy (what makes this even worse is the fact that there is no reasoning behind it)\\, Finn is comedic relief trying to be heroic and Po is a hot head now? \\n\\nThis movie (although painfully a good film)\\, is a terrible Star Wars movie. \\n\\nSimply put Rian Johnson and the writers of the last jedi have spit in the faces of all of the movies that came before it\\, and the long term fans that have cherished these movies for DECADES! \\n\\n\\\"HELP ME JJ ABRAMS\\, YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE\\\"","true":true}
