The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have just finished the story\\, this is a very honest opinion from Naughty dog fan and a very big fan of the last of usRate 4\/10ProGraphicThe graphic is terrific\\, you could feel how it is very beautiful and look real\\, this is very impressive GameplayI enjoyed the gameplay very much\\, Ellie is very flexible\\, during the fight\\, she could evade\\, and strike back\\, this is also impressive  and all of the weapons are very good\\, the silencer is great\\, the bow very useful\\, even more than Joel\u2019s bowConStory The story has a very big plot hole on it\\,- Joel the experienced veteran man\\, survived many events\\, always be careful and very hard to trust someone\\, He just gave his name to a stranger who he has just met without knowing their background? Like walk in the park and introduce themselves\\, it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all and because of that\\, it leads to his death\\, this is a very big plot hole- Then you played as Ellie to go all the way for revenge\\, kills so many people that did nothing to her\\, finally just to let that person who killed Joel live? (This kind of understandable if you really try to think that the killer spared Dina so Elli would want to stop all of the revenge and let the killer go)- The worst of all\\, you have to play as Joel\u2019s killer for 8 hours\\, 8 long hours that I have to play as her\\, at least you should have given an option if the player wants to play as the killer or notI played the last of us part 1 maybe more than 20 times but for the last of us part 2\\, I don\u2019t think I can go through that again\\, especially the part that I have to play as Abby(Joel\u2019s killer)In conclusion - Good gameplay\\, - Great graphic\\,- Disappointing story\u2026 Expand","true":true}
