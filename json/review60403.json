The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us 2 has one of the most disappointing stories from a Triple A game I have ever seen\\, that ultimately ends on a sour note\\, with the entire journey being pointless. The entire basis is its a revenge story. The main character Ellie journeys hundreds of miles\\, murders countless people\\, gets people she cares about hurt and killed all so she can kill one particular person\\, and when she finally get the chance at the end\\, she changes her mind and lets her go\\, wasting time\\, effort\\, and resources.\r\rThere are many characters\\, few of which are likable\\, contrasting the amazing mix of personalities in the first. Your main partner Dina is incredibly annoying\\, with her only notable trait being her constant inappropriate flirting with Ellie. Stand out characters include Lev\\, Yara\\, Owen\\, and Abby.\r\rThe writing is mainly focused of the characters relationships with eachother and there is little focus on the Infected or Apocalypse. There are multiple unnecessary sexual scenes that are legitimately painful to sit through.\r\rThe gameplay is largely the same as the first\\, with some basic improvements in exploration and combat\\, such as larger play areas with more verticality\\, new moves such as a dodge and the ability to go prone. The graphics are fantastic (albeit diminished by the intense film grain) as well as the sound design and voice acting. The game is locked at 30FPS with a Film Grain that cannot be disabled. There is also by far the largest amount of settings I have ever seen in a game making it as accessible as possible for everyone. There are significantly less environmental puzzles and cinematic moments than the original and there's much greater emphasis on combat and scavenging supplies.\r\rThe game will shift between playing as Ellie and playing as Abby\\, which have completely different equipment and weapons. The story will often shift time periods like a Tarantino movie which is detrimental to the plots pacing.\r\rOverall The Last of Us 2 is not exactly \\\"Bad\\\"\\, but after 7 years it is definitely a below-average disappointment and I have no desire to play it again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
