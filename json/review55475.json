Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most people are saying the backlash against this film is unwarranted. I think it is very much warranted and I for one hope Disney listens to the public. There is lots wrong with this film. There are many plot holes that have slipped through the editing process. The lore and rules have been broken in many ways which undermines all the films that came before it. Also There is a whole subplot that is meaningless in the long run. Many of the characterisations fall flat and we don't feel for the new characters. Also the old characters are disrespected in many ways. You can really feel the absence of Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas with this one. Such a shame. Hopefully Episode IX can turn it around but this films disrespect of the Force Awakens have put them in a really difficult position. Not to mention Carrie Fishers tragic\\, untimely passing.","true":true}
