Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie that does not live up to the Star Wars brand.\\nFirst the good. It earns one star for it's handling of the Force which believably added or for the first time displayed elements such as Force projection\\, and Snoke's human telekinesis which must take great discipline.\\nIt earns another star for having some legitimately good moments\\, like the moment Kilo is about to shoot Leia but hesitates\\, as well as the addition of DJ\\, the best character in the film.\\n\\nIt loses a Star for killing Snoke such that he's inconsequential to the story\\, whereas we had been promised he was an important and formidable adversary. It loses a star for the ridiculous Casino side story that was also inconsequential aside from shoving the worst character in the film\\, Rose Tiko in our faces for half an hour. It loses a third star for the \\\"your mom\\\" joke in the first scene and other poorly placed slapstick peppered throughout the film. It loses another star for making the First Order appear incompetent and goofy rather than powerful and menacing\\, removing most tension throughout. It loses a fifth star for the inexplicable character assassination of Luke completely out of line with him as portrayed in the original trilogy\\, and as he was promised in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nIt loses a star for continuing to make Rey an unpalatable Mary Sue able to beat Luke in a fight\\, kill Snoke with a cheap trick\\, beat Kilo in a fair fight\\, and down three TIE fighters in one shot\\, all with zero real training in the Force or the lightsaber.\\nIt loses a seventh star for all the forced diversity\\, feminist otherwise misandrist  themes\\, with zero competent and empowered men aside from maybe DJ the betrayer.\\nIt loses another star because rather than world building\\, this film manages to shrink the world of Star Wars drastically\\, even telling us the entire Resistance now fits inside the Millennium Falcon\\, and that all their unnamed allies have betrayed them. Whereas Star Wars promises a war ranging across a vast galaxy\\, no Star Wars movie has ever felt so small.\\nIt loses a ninth star for failing to do anything with the story that was actually unique in a good way\\, despite seeking to constantly subvert expectations. The biggest example is that Rey could've joined Kylo\\, opening many unexplored story options. Instead it took the easy route.\\n\\nThe film earned 2 stars but lost 10\\, totalling -8 stars\\, or the lowest score available which is 1\/2 star.","true":true}
