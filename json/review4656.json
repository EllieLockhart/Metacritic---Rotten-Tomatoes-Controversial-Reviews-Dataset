{"101487":113555,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete and utter garbage. It\u2019s not Rian Johnson\u2019s fault that nearly every new(ish) character not named Rey is boring at best or that Luke Skywalker remains as annoying three decades later as he was in the original trilogy. I\u2019m going to lay the ridiculously cheesy dialog and the just plain stupid plot at his feet though. Add to that overzealous onslaught of Jar Jar Binks caliber levity and a run time that\u2019s a solid sixty minutes too long\\, and The Last Jedi is so atrocious that I actually found myself hoping that the rebellion would in fact be destroyed\\, the series mercifully ended and the audience put out of our collective misery. It\u2019s not the worst installment in the series (that distinction still belongs to The Phantom Menace)\\, but Johnson\u2019s childhood destroying abomination comes in a close second. My five year old couldn\u2019t wait to go home and my sixteen year old called it \u201cone of the most disappointing experiences of his life\u201d\\, proving that you didn\u2019t have to be as emotionally invested in this story as I was to be completely let down by this film.
