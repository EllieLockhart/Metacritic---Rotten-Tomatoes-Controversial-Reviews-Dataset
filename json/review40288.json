Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't the star wars movie you're looking for. This is a good attempt to try and mimic a guardians of the galaxy per se. Forced humor\\, drawn out\\, no development of hyped characters\\, and ruined old characters. Way to ruin Luke Skywalker Rian. Disney you're crazy to give this guy the next trilogy. Smh","true":true}
