Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated what they did with the characters. The story was boring and didn't make a whole lot of sense. Rey is a Mary Sue. The whole Canto Bight section of the movie could be eliminated without any effect on the rest of the movie. Just terrible. I've tried to give it more chances\\, but I can't even make it through the movie when i try and give it a second\\, third\\, and fourth chance.","true":true}
