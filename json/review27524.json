Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall it\u2019s a good movie. It\u2019s middle if the pack for me in terms of Star Wars films. So much anticipation built up into these characters just to have it fall flat. I really wanted to love this movie but I just like it. I enjoyed it but left the theater asking myself \u201cwhy did they do that\u201d \u201cwhat was the point of that\u201d and \u201cwhat were they thinking\u201d. After a second viewing and a rewatch of The Force Awakens\\, I liked it better. Changed my rating. ","true":true}
