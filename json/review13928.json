Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are reading the audience critics in order to decide whether to buy the DVD or Blu Ray of this movie or not\\, do yourself a favor and buy something else.\\nThis movie is a parody of Star Wars\\, made only to mock Star Wars\\, its characters\\, heroes\\, lore and beliefs and\\, most importantly\\, to deride its fans and slap them in the face.\\nDisney decided that if you like Star Wars\\, you are a stupid whiny white male\\, possibly voting for Trump\\, and served you with the most horrible SJW\\, feminazi\\, anti-male\\, anti-white\\, anti-war (in a movie called Star Wars!) propaganda shoved down your throat while showing you a gigantic middle-finger and a monstrous grin.\\nIf you really liked the old Star Wars flicks\\, this movie cannot\\, in any single way\\, satisfy you. \\nIf you like The Transformers or Ghostbusters 2\\, you may like it\\, though.","true":true}
