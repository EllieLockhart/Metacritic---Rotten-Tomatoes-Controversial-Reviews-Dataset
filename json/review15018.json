Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know I've never been more disappointed in a film! This is what happens when film makers kowtow to SJW's! Good storytelling and great characterization go right out the window in favor of an overblown political agenda. Why are all the men in this film weak or villainous or just plain stupid? Don't get me started on the trashing of Luke Skywalker. Why are all the women brave and super-smart? Rey doesn't have to do more than own a vulva to be the most powerful Jedi ever. Even without a bit of training\\, she knows all the subtleties of using the Force\\, including the Jedi mind trick.  REALLY??\\n\\nThe blatant merchandising in this film is an absolute disgrace. I hope parents catch on and DO NOT put any plushy porgs under the Xmas tree. In fact\\, NO ONE should reward Disney financially for ruining what was once a magical franchise. I'm probably worrying for nothing\\, because I can't imagine anyone would want to sit through this wretched film twice or to buy anything that reminded them of it. \\n\\nA truly PUTRID film!!","true":true}
