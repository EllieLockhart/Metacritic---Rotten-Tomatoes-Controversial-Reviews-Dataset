Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The Last Jedi was great. Finally we get to see something original and refreshing! Something that wasn't just another copy and paste story being reused because of its popularity and promise of nostalgia. The Last Jedi takes the series in a new and unforeseen direction we (the audience) didn't see coming\\, and in a time when Hollywood is filled to the brim with studios producing nothing but financially safe reboots\\, that surprise is something to be celebrated!!!  How could anyone like The Force Awakens over something that was actually new and original! That movie had nothing new to give to us. Why bother if you've seen and heard the same story before!? If you like old movies with old idea\\, stay home and watch them on your vhs player","true":true}
