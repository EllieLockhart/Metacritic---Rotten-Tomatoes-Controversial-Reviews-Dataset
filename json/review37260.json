Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people who say this is a bad film are the 45 year old virgins who only want the original trilogy and nostalgia.\\nThis movie was great\\, far from perfect but overall a solid movie\\, some unnecessary plot points here and there but what do you expect from a movie originally 3 hours long. I had tremendous fun watching this and I can't reccomend it enough.","true":true}
