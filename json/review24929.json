Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My first time with TLJ was a divisive experience. A lot felt out of place and there was too much going on. Gave me mixed feelings. I saw it a second time yesterday... and it was great! Sure\\, it has some flaws and too many jokes\\, but the movie as a whole just blew me away. The stakes are super high\\, it's unpredictable and heartfelt. There are so many moments that made me happy or burst in tears\\, that I can forget about the bits I didn't like. No Star Wars is flawless\\, so i made my peace with it and enjoyed it SO MUCH.\\n\\nNew additions to the universe are always tricky business to me\\, because I hold it so very dear. Falling in love with them is always a process\\, so I think it will grow even more. \\n\\nRight now I like TFA a little better\\, but who knows. Here's my ranking of all SW movies from worst to best:\\n\\nattack of the clones \\nrevenge of the sith \\nthe phantom menace \\nrogue one \\na new hope (it's so old)\\nthe last jedi \\nthe force awakens \\nthe empire strikes back\/return of the jedi (can't decide)","true":true}
