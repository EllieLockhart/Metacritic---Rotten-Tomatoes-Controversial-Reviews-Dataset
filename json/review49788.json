Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yet another nod to the fans - but this time\\, it lacked the magic of the originals which 'The Force Awakens' was able to deliver. Perhaps this is becoming less about the films\\, and more around monetising ill-prepared scrips.","true":true}
