Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie of the entire series. Highly disappointed in the whole franchise right now I think JJ Abrams or whoever needs to be fired and George Lucas needs to come back and take control of Star Wars again. No way in hell this movie deserves a 93 score from critics. If I could I would give this movie 0 stars.","true":true}
