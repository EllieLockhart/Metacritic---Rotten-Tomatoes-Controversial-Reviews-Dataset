Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Whole scenes could\u2019ve been left out. Nothing seemed to make sense. Story line was terrible. Characters were unlikeable. I am a huge star wars fan but I won\u2019t be for long if this kind of crap continues. Thank god for Rogue One. This 8 makes me appreciate the phantom menace. I wanted to love the movie but now I\u2019m struggling to find anything I liked about it. Even the scenes that should\u2019ve been epic were destroyed by misplaced humor. It seemed like whoever wrote the script didn\u2019t know what direction to take so didn\u2019t go anywhere at all. I\u2019m so disappointed. ","true":true}
