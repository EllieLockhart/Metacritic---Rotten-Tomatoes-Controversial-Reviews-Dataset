Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun\\, filled with some truly jaw dropping moments & some great performances by cast. I feel as if the humour should have been left to BB8\\, the film felt like a Marvel feature at times.\\nBut all in all\\, this is one hell of a movie.","true":true}
