Helped no end by the facial animation. Even better than the previous high water mark of Horizon Zero Dawn. Graphically excellent. Audio is superb and woven into the game mechanics really nicely.

Combat always feels like I could have done it better but stealth works far better than in most games. Scavenging becomes a bit tiresome but finding a little trove of goodies still raises a smile.

Completely seamless level loading\\, assisted by some very well scripted intermissions. Love this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
