Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies. Little to no character development and almost completely ignored what was set up in The Force Awakens. Also stuffed with real world politics\\, which was a poor choice in my opinion\\, regardless of which side it was taking.\\nAbsolutely love Star Wars\\, loved The Force Awakens\\, liked Rogue One enough\\, but thanks to this how disappointing this movie was\\, I'll probably just wait to rent whatever comes out next.","true":true}
