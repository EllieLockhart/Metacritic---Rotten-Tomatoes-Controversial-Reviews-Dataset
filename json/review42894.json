Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so bad I actually created a Roten Tomatoes account to write this review so I can warn anyone out there to save two and a half hours of your life you'll never get back.  I seriously have no idea what this film was supposed to accomplish...it's obvious the film makers just threw a bunch of crap at at a wall sold it to the public.  Complete garbage.","true":true}
