Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bottom of the list as far as Star Wars movies go.  Bad writing\\, bad character development\\, bad director\\, bad producer.  We should all be refunded our money for this film. Hopefully a once great universe can be salvaged.","true":true}
