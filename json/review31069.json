Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so i was streaming this abomination of a starwars movie and it started buffering... decided to go make something to eat... 5 hours later i realised that i didnt even see the movie to the end... thats how bad and forgettable this shit is...","true":true}
