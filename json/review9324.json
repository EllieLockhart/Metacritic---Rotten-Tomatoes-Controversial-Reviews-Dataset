Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gee I feel so vindicated.  I said TFA has ruined the plotline of the series and that the  next one would be even worse and...tadaaaaaa!  It is!  Now Luke is just a mopey loser who never really accomplished anything other than walking out on his friends and family and dying sitting on his tush.  But I suppose...what else would you expect from a white male?","true":true}
