Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So this is how Star Wars dies...With thunderous laughter\\, and disappointment.\\n\\nI have no idea how this made it through scripting\\, story boards\\, and early screenings. With no one once standing up and saying \\\"What the hell is this crap? This isn't Star Wars! This comes off as a Comedy Central special\\, and no Star Wars fan will ever accept this as an acceptable story\\\"\\n\\nI'm sure some youngster\\, that has never seen another Star Wars movie\\, is probably going to watch this\\, and think it's the best movie they have ever seen. But they will grow up\\, and go back and watch the real story from Episode 1 through to Episode 7\\, then get back to this one and ask themselves \\\"What Happened\\\".\\n\\nNot the worst movie of all time\\, but in my opinion\\, not worthy of existing in the Star Wars universe. This should just be the end of a 2 part arc. Wow... just wow.\\n\\nJJ has a lot of work to do if he's going to try to somehow put all the tooth paste back in the tube after this mess.","true":true}
