Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a Star Wars fan\\, then you can't disguise how you love this movie that almost ruined all the reputation and extraordinary characters that the series had been established by George Lucas. What a shame.","true":true}
