Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the easiest way to describe this movie would be taking every interesting idea from the Force Awakens (which was ok not great) and burning it. Who is snoke. We dont care. Who are Reys parents doesnt matter. Why did luke leave a map to find him. It just happened. Who had Luke's lightsaber. He didnt want it so doesnt matter. Who are Knights of Ren. No one cares. Why did Phasma live. So we could kill her with the Janitor who is worst fighter in first order. Why is Rey so powerful. Because we said so. What has Luke been doing. Nothing because we are going to #$%^ up his whole morailty and character because men are evil look at the frist order. Women are good look at resistance. Also there are like a total of 200 resistance fighters left\\, but Poe has never even heard of the Purple haired admiral. Like how the heck does he never ask hey who is she at their meetings...... I could go on you get the point. It was a waste of time and money. You bring Luke back after 2 movies and 40 years waiting and he doesnt do anything. Rey more of less beats him up..... ........ Rey is now star wars Jesus so thats leaves alot of plot points left to cover in the 9th film.....","true":true}
