Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hello. So I just decided to make an account on RT.\\n\\nI am not a bot\\, and as far as I know\\, I'm not Russian.\\n\\nThis movie really went against everything I held dear in this franchise.\\n\\nFrom a moviemaking standpoint\\, it's a competent film\\, plagued with bad pacing and some convoluted and convenient writing. It's ok. It's mostly engaging and entertaining. The visuals are great. The diverse cast was a positive in TFA\\, but here they're all wasted... Some of their stories could have been left out and nothing would have changed.  \\n\\nBut the story is an absolute disaster. Ignoring everything that came before it\\, just to have specific story beats\\, that are not worth it. it ruined heroes\\, it ruined legacy.\\n\\nThis is why I think it deserves to be at the bottom. \\n\\nMay the Force be with you.","true":true}
