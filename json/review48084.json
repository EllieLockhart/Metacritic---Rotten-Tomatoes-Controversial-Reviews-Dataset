Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the lackluster of answers to our questions make people dislike this movie\\, this just makes me more thrilled to have watched it\\, and excited to see IX. Some plot devices\\, minor ones\\, but still had enough screen time to showcase the awe in them. This movie would be awesome especially for the new generations of Star Wars fans. The last 0.5 on the 5th star was to honor Carrie Fisher\\, the first 0.5\\, it was because of the majesty of the twin suns. Thank you Rian and J.J\\, but thank you George Lucas.","true":true}
