Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen it twice and I end up liking it much more after the 2nd viewing.  Also the 2nd viewing was at Disney Springs in a Dolby HDR all captivating auditorium with the Dolby Altos sound.  It was awesome.  The first viewing I really didn't like Finn and Roses story at all. Thought it was a distraction because I just wanted to get back to Rey and Luke's story. Second viewing there subplot did not bother me.  No spoiler here because this is just our theory which my wife came up with is we think Kylo Ren and Rey are somehow brother and sister\\, and I think Kylo already knows that.  After my wife pointed that out it just seemed to make a lot of sense to me.  Overall I think I like both The Force Awakens and Rogue One a little better than The Last Jedi.  Ryan Johnson kind of deflated some of the mystery and fan theories JJ Abrahams created in The Force Awakens.","true":true}
