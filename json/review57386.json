Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie spits in the face of anyone who has any attachments to the original trilogy. All of the original main characters are destroyed by completely reversing any character development that occurred in episodes 4-6. Assumingly just to make room for Ray (an even bigger Mary Sue now than before) and her uninteresting friends. \\n\\nThe closest thing this story had to any kind of character development was Fin\\, but they stole that from him with a very awkward forced \\\"love\\\" dynamic. Can't even remember Fin's new girlfriends name. This whole movie is entirely forgettable. Maybe that's a good thing so we cn keep our sanity after what they did to this franchise.","true":true}
