Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand some \\\"fans\\\" are disappointed in this movie - to them I say you are correct: this is not the nostalgia-wank bang bang shoot'em up Skywalker soap opera.\\n\\nLast Jedi advanced the story into the future past the Skywalker soap opera saga. It gives the potential for the universe of Star Wars to be explored\\, and did so in a way that was visually similar and different to the original trilogy. Depending on how 9 goes I might say this is my favorite.","true":true}
