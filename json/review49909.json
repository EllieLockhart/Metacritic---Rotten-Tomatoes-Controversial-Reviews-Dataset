Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You dont weaponize hyperspace. It makes all the Death Star battles silly. All you need to do is program 3PO to hyperspace The Falcon into the Death Star. End credits. Luke milking and being a hermit is not the same guy who \\\"had to try\\\" to save his Dad. Poor decision to turn the most opitimistic charecter in the Universe into a a defeated hermit. There was too much pushing of social issues. Many of us watch sci fi to escape everyday. I am all for social progression\\, but can we focus on a galaxy far far away please?","true":true}
