{"101487":178234,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-14","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many reviews that say this movie is garbage\\, and that it's not \\\"real star wars\\\". That is so false on so many levels. Yes\\, some people may be divided on the twists in this movie (i personally loved the new direction)\\, but you cant say in any regard that this is an awful movie. Having grown up with the prequels i never felt that real love for star wars that people growing up in the 70s and 80s had. Now\\, with the Last Jedi\\, i understand it. SEE THIS MOVIE","true":true}
