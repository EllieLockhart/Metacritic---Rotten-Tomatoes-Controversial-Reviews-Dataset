Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Luke story line goes against Jedi theory about fear. The chosen one theory that Anakin was stronger in force because he was chosen and that if he had children they would be stronger in force than average Jedi is thrown out with Rey. I therefore see this movie as being inconsistent with previous Star Wars Movie lore. How Fin is handled also sucks as well as Maz\\, Holdo\/Akabar. I am still glad I saw the movie and love Star Wars. This is just a poor story. It\u2019s is still Star Wars though.","true":true}
