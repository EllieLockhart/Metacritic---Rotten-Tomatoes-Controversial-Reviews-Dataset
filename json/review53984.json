Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure which phrase better describes this movie\\, Dumpster Fire or Shit Sandwich.  How can this film have gotten a 91% rating from the critics?  I even wonder aabout the audience rating.  Everyone\\, EVERYONE I know who saw this did not like it.  How is this holding at 51% approval - rigged much?","true":true}
