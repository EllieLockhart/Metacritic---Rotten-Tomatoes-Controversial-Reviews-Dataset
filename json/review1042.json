Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who didn't like this movie is a hater. \\nI love every Star Wars and this easily competes with episode IV. It's was a great movie by itself. It focused more on itself than it did the trilogy. \\nThe best part is\\, it flows perfectly into the Star Wars universe","true":true}
