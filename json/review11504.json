Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie they shit all over SW. Made a joke out of everything with terrible garbage humor. Stupid slow speed space chase. I'm a huge SW fan and i liked TFA and loved R1 but this was complete garbage. Gonna be interesting to see if they continue down this garbage path on the Solo movie. If so i'm out SW isn't supposed to be garbage humor with stupid uneven tone throughout. The tone of SW has been established for 40 years what was the point of turning it into comical garbage?","true":true}
