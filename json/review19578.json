Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took me a month to get through this pile of crap. I seriously fell asleep the first time I saw it. When I woke up\\, it was over and I wondered what I missed. When I went back to the part I could remember\\, I got bored a second time. And I decided to not bother with it for a while. The next two weeks I'd go back and try to watch it\\, but everything about it was such a disorganised mess that I ended up putting it off for a bit longer. I finally got through it after a month of going back and forth. This film did nothing for the series. I mean\\, we could literally skip it altogether and would be much happier we did.","true":true}
