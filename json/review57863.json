Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, I really didn't like this film. I'll always applaud the attempt at something different\\, but not at the expense of a good story\\, good characters and logic in general. It seems to me that everything is reactionary\\, here. JJ Abrams made a movie very similar to ANH because of the trauma induced by the prequels among fans\\, and Rian Johnson made a very surprising movie because of the way fans said TFA was too similar to A New Hope.\\n\\nSadly\\, this movie was very messy\\, with incredible plot holes\\, absurd developments\\, overall arcs that left me speechless for looking a lot more like those of a TV series episode rather than a Star Wars film of 2h30mn\\, and some scenes that were thought out to be great future Youtube clips but which sacrifice common sense and logical character development for them to happen. Not to mention the mess that is the dropped storylines from TFA\\, I don't think I'd felt this way since watching the last season of Lost.\\n\\nWorst of all\\, the media seems unable to grasp what is wrong with this film and pretends it's all just \\\"hardcore fans\\\" manipulating scores. Well\\, sorry to break it to you guys\\, but I'm French\\, and here in France\\, our websites show even worse audience scores\\, and it's because of very regular movie-goers\\, not hardcore fans. What's incredible is the critic score\\, that's what people should be questioning right now\\, as well as Disney's pretty amazing influence over said critics\\, because regardless of how you felt about Luke's fate or decisions made about the direction of the trilogy\\, you just cannot call yourself a movie critique and not see or talk about the weakness of the script that Rian Johnson wrote\\, from pretty much every angle that good storytelling is analyzed on.\\n\\nAnd no\\, no\\, it's that it were too different for me\\, it's not that I need to watch it again to get it\\, and it's not that I just wasn't ready for such greatness. I was ready for a lot of things\\, but certainly not such a poor story being told. One star for some of the incredible visuals\\, the music and the acting in this movie\\, which were all superb.","true":true}
