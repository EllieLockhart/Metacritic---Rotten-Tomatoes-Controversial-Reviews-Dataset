Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Muy buena pel\u00edcula. Los primeros 100 minutos parecen un fan fic\\, pero una vez que empieza la acci\u00f3n te mantiene pegado al asiento. \\nEs la m\u00e1s arriesgada y ambiciosa de toda la saga.","true":false}
