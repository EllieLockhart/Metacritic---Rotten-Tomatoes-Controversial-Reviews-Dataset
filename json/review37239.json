Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The pacing was off\\, trying to pack 3 movies into 1.  Didn't feel for any of the characters.  Generic dialogue.  The humor mostly fell flat due to poor timing and misguided tone.  A bunch of useless scenes and head-scratching decisions by the characters.  Writing and Directing by a committee of Disney executives = a pile of hot steamy dog crap.  2017 sucked!   But\\, hey... the space battles looked cool.","true":true}
