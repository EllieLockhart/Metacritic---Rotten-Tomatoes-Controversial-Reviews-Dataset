Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm confused both why and how TLJ got made. Disney spent a lot of money on the SW property\\, but seems to want to destroy every. last. thing. about. it. In the three movies thus far released\\, galactic history has been completely re-written\\, the nature of the force has changed\\, and galactic geography and demographics are completely gone\/altered. Not once has a Lucas era alien race appeared that wasn't a previously existing character. There's no continuity with anything that has come before. Why not just make a new franchise and save $100B? Was it all to beat people across the face with very unsubtle political messages and bore them to tears with flat characters that never made it past archtypes during story boarding?\\n\\nTLJ isn't a good star wars movie\\, because it isn't a star wars movie. It's\\, at it's few best moments\\, star wars-ish... and that's being generous. Preserve your nostalgia and don't see this movie. Watch Clone Wars on Netflix. That is excellent star wars media.","true":true}
