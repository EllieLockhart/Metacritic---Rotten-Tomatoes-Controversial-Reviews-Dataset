Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a horrible mess of a movie.\\n\\ni don't know who approved this script which was written obviously by a 10yr old but damn him for raping this franchise. Nearly everything besides the visuals and seeing Mark Hamil again sucked a big one in this.\\n\\nThe main cast is stupidly annoying and unsympathetic because either they fuck up or win by luck\\, the villians are presented as a goofy bunch of losers without any backstory at all... how can so many people say they had a rollercoaster of emtions? The only emotion i had the most time was embarrassment about the shit i saw that called itself Star Wars.\\nSeriously\\, during Empire Strikes Back you felt frightened by the Empire and the looming darkness they brought with them\\, totally overwhelming and overshadowing the rebels but here? Feels more like a Looney Toons Star Wars Special than anything else.\\n\\nBut what pissed me off the most? THERE WAS STAR WARS IN THERE.\\nSome scenes really brought the stuff which had to be brought\\, but sadly only a few of them are in this movie. Lukes reunion with R2D2 was in my opinion absolutely right\\, I thought the force link between kylo and rey was an interesting concept and i would have loved to see it way further and more of a focus of the movie. \\n\\nThe humor never felt so forced like in this one. Everything is so over the top slapstick that it isn't even funny anymore. You thought the people were loud enough about JarJar\\, but clearly we were proven wrong.\\n\\nI don't know\\, I'm disappointed beyond believe what happened in this movie and how bland\\, uninspired it was delivered. Even the visuals cant compare with Rogue One which was clearly the prettier picture.\\n\\nSince i can only judge by the things i saw and don\u00b4t know any behind the scenes stuff:\\n\\nthank you to especially Mark Hamil\\, who loved the idea before Disney $$$'d it and now had to suffer through this mess. This movie whould have been such a bigger piece of garbage without you.\\n\\nBesides that thanks to Kylo Ren who is in my eyes very well performed by Adam Driver and the only decent written character anyways. He actually has struggle\\, options and variety while nearly everyone else is the absolute stereotype.\\n\\nI'm still clueless of what to come. I wasn't a big fan of Episode VII\\, i somehow really liked Rogue One and this.. it isn't the worst movie on earth\\, but it is besides episode 1 the worst star wars movie the franchise has ever seen.","true":true}
