Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Self-serving\\, forced reboot. Not a sequel to The Force Awakens. Betrays the Luke Skywalker character\\, and treats him like he's nothing\\, Rey is a Mary Sue. The Force Awakens felt very much like a remake\\, but it\\, at least\\, set up multiple points of interest. This movie just burns all that. How do they expect people to await the next one in anticipation\\, when we basically have nothing to hope for or speculate on\\, now.","true":true}
