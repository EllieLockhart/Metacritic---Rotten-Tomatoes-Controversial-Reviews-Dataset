Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, did I see the same movie as all the 5 star reviews???  I cannot for the life of me find one redeeming thing to say about this movie.  Ok\\, the music was great...there\\, that's one.\\n\\nSPOILERS\\nSeriously\\, this movie was terrible.  Half the movie took a dump on old characters (Luke\\, Leia and Ackbar) with irrational behavior\\, corny scenes and questionable send-offs.  The other half followed around other new characters (Rose and Holdo)  that were one-dimensional and forgettable.  \\n\\nAnd the main plot of the movie.. the resistance on a slow speed chase by the 1st order because they were running low on fuel???  With all the SJW in this movie I was waiting for them to start lecturing on alternative\\, clean fuel sources.","true":true}
