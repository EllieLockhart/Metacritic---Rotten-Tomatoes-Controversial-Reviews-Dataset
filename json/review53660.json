Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forced social politics and a plot that makes no sense. this movie degrades all of the core Star wars characters especially Luke Skywalker. This movie is boring\\, full of villains that are no real threat. And a hero in rRey that has no weaknesses no struggle no training a Mary Sue. Other than bashing men this movie has no purpose","true":true}
