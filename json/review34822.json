Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The eighth installment of the Skywalker saga is a feast to the eyes in which Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker\\, who is uneasy by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile\\, the Resistance prepares for battle with the First Order and it is an epic climax between good and evil. I was really surprised by all the events that took place and that I didn't expect. Its script is very good with excellent plot twists.","true":true}
