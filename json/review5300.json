Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely not for any true star wars fan\\, while it has interesting ideas\\, the failure in execution by Johnson dooms the movie. An entire sub-plot that seems forced and out if place\\, slows an already long movie. The time lines is off\\, and so many plot holes you'll break and ankle trying to avoid them. And of you were ever a fan of Luke Skywalker and his legacy\\, then this is a movie you should avoid.","true":true}
