Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far too many things made no sense. I get Disney made and sold books to explain everything about the movie after the movie came out (which is a horrible way to \\\"make a movie\\\")\\, but I went to see a movie\\, not see a movie & buy a book. Plus\\, even after answering several questions in the book\\, the story still was not a good one. If Disney's\\, and Rian's\\, plan was to \\\"kill the past\\\"\\, then they really should have come up with an original story with all original characters\\, instead of having the original characters come out and not BE themselves (except for Han who gets killed off...).","true":true}
