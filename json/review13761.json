Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I got an idea. Lets write a story about one big ass ship slowly out running another big ass ship\\, and call it Star Wars. Nice job! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \\n\\nWorst Star Wars movie ever!","true":true}
