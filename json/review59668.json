Graphics wise it\u2019s one of the most real looking games of all times. That by it self is why I gave it at least two stars. The best part of the first game is the story and putting you into heart breaking situation at the end. This games story feels like a feminist narrative being pushed on us.

That by it self is why I gave it at least two stars. The best part of the first game is the story and putting you into heart breaking situation at the end. This games story feels like a feminist narrative being pushed on us. Also in the game trailers it has a lot of false advertising regarding the main characters. The story is one that makes zero sense and feels like a feminist wet dream. Not only is the reason one of the main characters die ridiculous then you have to play as his killer. She\u2019s a very unlikable character as well as the rest of her group. You play to get to your revenge against this girl who killed you father figure only to not exact that revenge. The main issue is these characters are written out of character only to push a feminist agenda. The game play is about the same except the jump button. Who cares. It really does nothing. This has really soured me on ND. Worst sixty bucks I\u2019ve spent on a game in a long time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
