Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the huge discrepancy between critics and fans.  As far as I can tell this movie deserves about an 80-85% on the tomato-meter.  It was solid and fun and there were several unexpected and satisfying twists that made it stand out as unique and exciting and different than the movies that preceded it\\, while staying within the spirit of Star Wars and moving the story forward in a way that is impossible to forecast how it will wrap up.\\n\\nOn the other hand\\, enough of the dialogue was forced and there were a few extraneous scenes and characters that would limit it from being a perfect movie\\, but it was definitely another great Star Wars adventure\\, and Daisy Ridley does not disappoint.","true":true}
