Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF! They turned Luke into a pansy and a shell of his former self. The Luke I know would never do the things he does in this movie. Leia can fly for no reason.  Rey is absurdly powerful with no training or experience. I had to Google what a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" is. The new characters are boring and flat! Why even bother with Snoke only for that to be his fate! Awful writing! Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
