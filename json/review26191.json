Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure how you watch A New Hope\\, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and end up writing this piece of crap.  They have one last shot a redeeming themselves\\, but I probably won't be going to the theatre to find out.  The way Luke felt in this movie is the same way I feel about the new Star Whores movies.","true":true}
