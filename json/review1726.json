Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a standalone film it's great. It's honestly fresh and sets the franchise in a solidly new direction\\, whether they wanted to or not (RIP Carrie Fisher). Yet I was a bit let down because a lot of what 7 set up fizzles out (listen to my YouTube review on Drew's Corner for my rants). But  I'm fine with Rian getting his own trilogy considering it will not include any characters we know and thus he can make the series how he wants and he's definitely a great filmmaker.","true":true}
