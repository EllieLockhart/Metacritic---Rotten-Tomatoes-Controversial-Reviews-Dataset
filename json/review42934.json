Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a disappointment for a real Star Wars fan. The CGI looks great but does not make the plot any better. I was excited to see this movie after The Force Awakens but now I have no intention on seeing episode 9. Good job Disney you ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
