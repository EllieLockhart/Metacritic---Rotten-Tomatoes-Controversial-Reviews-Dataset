Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the second movie in a trilogy\\, it just does not work.  Putting aside the plot holes\\, inappropriate humor\\, and illogical developments\\, there is a bigger issue.  How does Mr. Abrams or Disney or whoever plan a trilogy and then let a separate writer\/director drive the train anywhere he wants without a plan as to where the trip will end or what the trip is?","true":true}
