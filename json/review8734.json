Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all the people who are writing negative reviews of this movie\\, I want to say I feel sorry for you.  \\nThis movie is amazing and ranks 2nd only to Empire. If you are a true fan of Star Wars you will see this movie for what it is and understand why this movie is setup the way it is.  This movie is for real fans of the franchise not those who claim to be a fan and just watch them just because.","true":true}
