Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst SW movie yet.  Hint:  Use of Hyperdrives could've made this movie 10 minutes long.  Lazy and thoughtless writing\\, HUGE plot holes\\, useless plot twists\\, useless characters\\, tarnishes first trilogy... This movie should be completely re-written and re-made before episode 9 - A fresh start if you will - I would've rated this -5 stars if I could but you have to give it at least 1 star to count.","true":true}
