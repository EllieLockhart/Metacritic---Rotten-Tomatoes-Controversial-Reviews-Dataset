Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.  I've seen them all in theaters and this movie had  several moments that blew me away. Can't understand the poor reviews as I don't think they saw the same movie I did. All my friends thought it was excellent.   I don't typically leave or read reviews here as reviews are always subjective. However I'm tired of my feed taking about this so I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in and raise the stupid aggregate score.","true":true}
