Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sad that this director gets another whole trilogy to direct. The opening lines between Poe and Hux were ridiculously stupid. This set the tone for the rest of this movie that turned out to be silly and unbelievable within a Star Wars universe. The Star Wars galaxy\\, planets\\, and systems seem to not exist in this film. Finn's plot does not change the story line. Not a good movie for fans.","true":true}
