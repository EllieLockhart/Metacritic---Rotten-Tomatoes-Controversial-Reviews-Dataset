Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Imagine a world where during one of the most anticipated movies of the year you turn over to see the looks on your kids face when they watch one of your greatest childhood heros squeeze the teat\/ballsack of a strange looking space cow. \\n\\nThis is the world we live in now. \\n\\nJar-jar was annoying. Like a splinter in your finger annoying. This movie is painful\\, like slowly being crushed in a trash compactor painful. And there's no R2 to rescue you this time. \\n\\nPoe \\\"tooling\\\" the empire. Bombs dropping in the gravity of space. Leia Poppins flying. A side quest to a casino to find the collector from Guardians that was so pointless\\, the only explanation for its exsistence is to push a blatant SJW agenda. \\n\\nAt least we found out who Snoke was right?  He's F'n dead\\, that's who he is. You thought Phasma was cool? F U!  She's dead too. \\n\\nCongrats Rian and Disney!  It takes a special kind of talent to completely gut one of the most beloved franchises in history in one fell swoop. \\n\\nNotmyluke\\n\\nThis is my opinion YMMV.","true":true}
