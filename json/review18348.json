Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was an awesome movie. The amount of erratic decisions made it seem so different than the others. It was very unique and broke most of the binds that I think are set in place by looking to hit a specific set of character arks. As far as just a movie I think its wonderful\\, the audio is as amazing as always\\, combat was grate\\, and the plot was solid.","true":true}
