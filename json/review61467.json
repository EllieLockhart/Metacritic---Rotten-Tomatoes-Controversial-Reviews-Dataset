Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"One of the best games of all time.

Yes\\, there are more questionable story twists than we had in the first part. Yes\\, some of the characters are controversial. Nevertheless\\, it's one of the most mature stories for the game industry.\r- Visual graphics are stunning\u2014the excellent final for the PS4 generation.\r- My applause to all the actors. All characters look and sound like real people. And yes\\, to all the haters of the exact actress. Grow up. Her role is the best in this story.\r- Music. Like in the first part. No other words needed.\r- Gameplay. Still interesting to explore and fight. Developers took some of their tricks from other games\\, like rope and grass gameplay from Uncharted 4\\, but it's great. These new (old) features freshened up the gameplay.\r- The team did an insane work with small details like face animation\\, physics\\, objects destruction\\, etc. You need to see it with your own eyes.\r\rTo sum up. Even if you find some characters\\, their decisions\\, or plot twists controversial; you still will be satisfied with this game. It's definitely not a zero\/1\/2 points like whiners say. If you love single players games\\, don't make them ruin your day. I wish everyone play the second part and enjoy the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
