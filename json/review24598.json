Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie just didnt flow well\\, casino planet was awful. They realy did a poor job with Lukes character. New chararters wwere not developed well at all. By far the worst of all the Star Wars films","true":true}
