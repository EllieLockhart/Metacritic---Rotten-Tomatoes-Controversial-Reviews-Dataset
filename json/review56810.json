Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot holes were massive\\, the story was mediocre\\, and it had the feeling of a prequel movie.  Yes there were good moments and decent acting but the movie as a whole can't be saved by a few moments in a 2.5 hr. film.  The argument that it's original and\/or risky is a lie as you can see massive similarities to Empire Strikes back.  I enjoyed TFA and it felt like everything original that was set up by JJ Abrams was thrown out the window so this director could write his own story. The timeline doesn't make sense and the movie as a whole feels unrealistic because of this.  Yes I know this is Star Wars regarding realism but it doesn't even follow the science of Star Wars.","true":true}
