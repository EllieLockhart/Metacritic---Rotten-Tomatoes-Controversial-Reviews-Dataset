Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. Original\\, unique script. Great acting. Without giving spoilers\\, I was surprised\\, but in the end\\, pleased with the storyline. Excellent addition to the Star Wars saga. If you remember\\, people were divided on Empire Srikes Back at first as well. Same with this movie. I am certain history will show that this is one of the best Star Wars movies to date.","true":true}
