Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I rather enjoyed this. Less of the whining from the new generation of characters than in The Force Awakens\\, still with the right amount of love and care taken over the characters we know and love from the old trilogy. Great to see some equality and diversity throughout the cast and extras\\, and amazing visual effects and creature design. Saw it twice; didn't lose its impact on the second viewing. Also a great tribute to the late\\, great Carrie Fisher. Can't wait for the DVD release.","true":true}
