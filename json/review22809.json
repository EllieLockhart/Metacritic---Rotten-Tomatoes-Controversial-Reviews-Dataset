Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"long boring movie.  Plot devices were thrown in just to make the movie longer.  My 8 year old poked holes in the plot\\, and was constantly asking why they did something\\, only to find out what they spent the last 20 minutes doing was pointless.","true":true}
