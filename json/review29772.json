Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian\\, you should never work in Hollywood again. Brick and Looper were great\\, but you were NOT ready for this. Horrifying dialogue\\, Jar Jar Binks-ing it up with the \\\"forced\\\" comedy\\, astral projection\\, completely unnecessary character development at the expense of characters we cared about\\, killing characters for the sake of killing them with ZERO shock value (subtlety and subtext used to be more impactful ways of telling a story than this heavy-handed force-it-down-your-throat style)\\, Leia surviving space but destined to die in 9\\, YODA USING FORCE LIGHTNING AND NOT TALKING LIKE YODA...you ruined my childhood you hack. Maybe JJ will use episode 9 to reboot 8 as a bad force dream. That's our only hope.","true":true}
