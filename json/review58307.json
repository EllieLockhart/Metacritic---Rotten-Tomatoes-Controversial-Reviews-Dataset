Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute plot hole filled garbage. If hyperspace could be harnessed as a weapon\\, the Empire would have forewent 'starkiller bases' and the death stars to create empty heavy ships with a hyperdrive to careen in to planets or other ships. Also\\, the movie makes Leia an obscenely powerful force user with little or no training? Speaking of such\\, Rey (Rea? Rae? Rue? Mary Sue?) is also an incredible force user\\, pilot\\, lightsaber duelist and strategist and has no back story as to how this happened! These also break all the rules that have been created in all the other star wars films\/books canon or not. \\n\\nIn addition\\, bombers such as the ones used in the first scenes are by far inferior to Y-wings and have no strategic value for anyone during a space battle. What Rian forgets is that space battles are non linear\\, and have multiple axis of combat (what is 'up' in space is relative) so the bombers are badly thought out. \\n\\nWill go to the next movie just to see how Abrams attempts to fix the trainwreck which is this film.","true":true}
