Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So it's still Star Wars\\, but Abrams really had to let everyone know he directed this movie with over mechanical looking new ships\\, a storyline that jumps around at every opportunity\\, and by completely killing off the entire story by the end of the movie. There was such a great opportunity for this movie to build off a a great platform in the force awakens\\, and it has completely turned into a Star Wars themed shitty ass transformers movie. How many stories and half assed characters can we cram into one movie? Building off of the old characters would have more than enough. Everything felt rushed and the answers that everyone was waiting for were either unanswered or completely brushed off at the lowest grade reading level. They were nobodies. Fml. Really pissed.","true":true}
