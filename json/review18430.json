Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is beyond clear that the critics who are giving this near universal acclaim are bought shills for Disney.  And\\, it is also clear that MANY of the positive reviews for this film are paid trolls.  Read the reviews of many of them\\, very short and offer ridiculous comments like ''popcorn theatric cinema' at its best'.   Wth does that even MEAN? All kinds of stupidity like that which shows many are not real people but people paid to elevate the movie rating.  My guess this would be closer to 27% like no 56%.  The movie was FILLED with political agenda pushing (agenda 21 anyone - if you don't know go look it up on youtube).  Mark Hamill warned that the treatment of his character was wrong and did not like the way they portrayed Skywalker\\, he should have broken his contract rather than play it.  Don't waste your money\\, it will be online soon enough as promo for the next garbage piece.  Really\\, it would have been better off to let the series end with the originals rather than torture it with these prequels and sequels\\, but it is a money machine (only because we are stupid enough to participate).   Save your money\\, if you let your curiosity get the best of you\\, you can't say you were not warned.   What a sad thing to happen to such a great series.  I'm going to pretend that all of the movies outside the original three were a bad dreams.","true":true}
