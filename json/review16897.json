Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In this instalment of Star Wars the force of the Jedi and the dark are shown in a such a way as to create an alluring analogy comparison to some faiths. That being said\\, expect this film to either be liked or disliked. The film creates a contrast of the two schools of thought and builds tension leading towards it. A dark study into the world of this religion evokes feelings of temptation and choices for our heroes. Hamil and the entire nail nearly every scene\\, with Hamil giving us his most memorable performance to date of Skywalker. A sure treat on the eyes as it is on the senses. Despite this\\, film remains very split among audiences. For me... The force is strong with this one! ","true":true}
