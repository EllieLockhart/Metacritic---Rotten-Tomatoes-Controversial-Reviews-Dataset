Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson admittedly messed with this movie to take a new direction. He turned this franchise into a Fast & Furious commercial type of movie just to cash more money. Forget what you've learned in the last decades about Jedi and lore\\, it will soon mean nothing. I'm so sad\\, never tought I'd hate a SW movie so much\\, it's been over a week and I can't still believe it. Rian succeeded in his sabotage mission.","true":true}
