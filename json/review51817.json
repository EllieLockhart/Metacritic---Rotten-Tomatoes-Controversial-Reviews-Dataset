Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic addition the the series! Mark Hamill delivers his best performance to date a Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson handles balancing a variety of plotlines with thought and care. Each character is given a progressive story arch that leaves them in some unique and interesting places. Questions that we thought would not be answered receive surprising and unexpected revelations that redefine our heroes' journeys. Absolutely a must-see film\\, and an instant classic!","true":true}
