Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't recommend this movie at all. Definitely the worst in the saga with the attack of the clones. The film fails miserably in the presentation of each old character and in the development of the new ones. Is also too long and pretentious\\, being extremely boring\\, and has really really badly written dialogues (which makes me wonder if the screenwriters read something more than the newspaper or if they really think that the public has some deficiency mental). The argument is most of the footage uninteresting\\, trying to be epic in scenes that are completely irrelevant and ironically destroying any emotion in those that should be\\, with abusing bad jokes and a silly humor.","true":true}
