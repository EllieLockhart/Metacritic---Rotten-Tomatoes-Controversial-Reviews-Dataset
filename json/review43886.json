Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Those who gave poor ratings on this site for The Last Jedi should give this one another chance.  I didn't see this movie until after i saw the hot mess dumpster fire that is Rise of Skywalker.  However\\, this movie far surpassed my expectations that were based on the reviews on this site!  The Last Jedi is by far the best movie in the new Star Wars trilogy.  Yes\\, it had some ridiculous scenes like Leia flying through space\\, and Ren killing off Snoke (yet again saving Rey who is always trying to kill him).  But there was also a plot to follow\\, and story the viewer could believe in.  It was very easy to get on the \\\"good\\\" side and root for Luke to cast away his grumpiness and use his powers to help the rebellion.  It had feeling\\, and some nostalgia.  There was a darkness to it that really captures the hopelessness of the fight\\, and when you feel all is lost\\, there is Luke using his powers to give our new \\\"hero's\\\" a chance to escape and regroup.  It also has Rey playing a minor role in the movie\\, which definitely helps.  It's always great when the absolute worst Star Wars character in the franchise isn't around too much to ruin a solid story.  Unlike to episode VII and IX\\, this one feels like a Star Wars movie.  And despite it's flaws\\, it's good and worth multiple future viewings.","true":true}
