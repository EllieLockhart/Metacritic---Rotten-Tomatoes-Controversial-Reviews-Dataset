Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that so many people don't like this movie is a travesty.

It took a second viewing for me to realize how awesome it really was. Definitely not the best\\, but a very well-done movie. I can certainly sympathize with some of the disapproval\\, but people who don't like it because \\\"it wasn't what [they were] expecting\\\" should bite their tongue and think back to when they criticized Force Awakens for being the same as a New Hope.
