Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was lost. Luke's character was inconsistent with his real character. Treatment of Luke was completely wrong. Las Vegas type casino city was a bizarre and strange detour\\, totally unnecessary. The lack of training for Rey was totally inconsistent with Jedi history in the movie. Focus on interracial relationship is bizarre and unnecessary. The over representation of women commanders seemed political and strange for Star Wars. They really got this one wrong. The joke scene at the beginning was more appropriate for a scene out of Space Balls\\, not Star Wars. Treatment of Luke was one of the biggest movie blunders of all time. That character was unrecognizable.","true":true}
