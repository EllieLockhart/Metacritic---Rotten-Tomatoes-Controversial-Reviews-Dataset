Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely shat on the history of the franchise. I've gotten over the expanded universe being kicked out of the cannon\\, but this movie seems to want to toss the cannon too. *minor spoiler* when Luke tossed the lightsaber over the cliff\\, my first thought was\\, \\\"this is how this movie treats the history of the franchise\\, with contempt.\\\" The action was flashy and the special effects were good\\, but the plot was maddening and Rey's Mary Sueness got even worse. To me\\, this movie is the second worse of the entire franchise\\, only better than The Phantom Menace\\, and that only because it doesn't have JarJar.","true":true}
