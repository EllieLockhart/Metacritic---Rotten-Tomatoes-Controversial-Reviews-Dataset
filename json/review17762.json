Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does not have a good argument to det on with the movie\\, and the long that it is became it boring\\, it is nor entertaining and is plenty of bad jokes. This not answer any character mistery and does not have any conclussion.","true":true}
