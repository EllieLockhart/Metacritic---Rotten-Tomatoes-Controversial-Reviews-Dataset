Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Misplaced humour\\, no soul\\, awful new characters...it's horrible.\\nLuke has been reduced to a comedy character and what made Ep VII so enjoyable was non-existent here.\\nIt's over-long and ultimately just the most pointless entry in the whole series.\\nHux becoming a comedy character.\\nLuke becoming a parody of himself.\\nFeminist agenda bullshit.\\nSuperLeia.\\nRey's parentage.\\nRey just being powerful to balance the force...!?\\nLuke going away to die...but leaving a map behind.\\nThe whole Fin\/Rose subplot.\\nLaura Dern's pointless character.\\nPo: Hero to Zero.\\nA tiny\\, unsupported\\, resitance even after blowing up Starkiller base.\\nPhasma wasted.\\nSnoke wasted.\\nSnoke's stupid death.\\nThe stupid reason for Luke to kill Ben.\\n...that's just a few of the reasons this film sucks.","true":true}
