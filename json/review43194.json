Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This stakes quite the claim to be the worst Star Wars movie of them all. And that is really saying something as the prequel trilogy was at-best \\\"pretty terrible\\\".\\n\\nThis film barely feels like an actual movie. It honestly feels like the first few hours of an RPG video game where you go randomly around looking for quests to eventually get to some sort of story. Except that story never materializes in this. It's just full of -bad- slapstick\\, and pointless \\\"stuff\\\".\\n\\nThe audience really doesn't even know what kind of time scale this film happens on. Is it minutes right after \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"? Well from the Rey\/Luke plotline you are led to believe so. But then how is the First Order winning against the Rebels after StarKiller base was destroyed? Wouldn't that take months of maneuvering and tactics? How long did Finn and Rose's \\\"mission\\\" actually last? Why does nothing in this film try to make sense?\\n\\nThis is a truly awful movie from and sort of fan standpoint\\, and it's not really good as a standalone. There is no character development and the opportunity to develop any of the prior characters further is just wasted. This is a pointless film. There isn't really any plot or mystery set up to be solved in the upcoming third film.  Wait until it comes out on DVR unless you feel like giving Disney $15 bucks for nothing.","true":true}
