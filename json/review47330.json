Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of money\\, Disney screws up yet again. The plot was so unconvincing I felt I was watching a kindergarten theatre act. I almost puked with how recycled and unoriginal it was and to kill Luke for no reason shows you their disrespect and greed when it comes to Star Wars prepare to be invaded by Disney's marketing of this now destroyed franchise!","true":true}
