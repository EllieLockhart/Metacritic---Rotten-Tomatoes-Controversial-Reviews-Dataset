Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally thought the movie was great. It was unpredictable and really well made. Funny\\, if a little overdone at times. It was missing explanations here and there\\, but did a lot of things right. I believe in allowing writers and directors the freedom to be creative and give us something unexpected even if it doesn't meet all expectations. Star Wars is loved by so many and so much is expected of any new installment. The quality of the film is worth at least 3 stars alone and more if you enjoyed other parts as well. I don't like to have outrageous expectations for films like this because that leaves no room for surprises or creative liberties. If the fans were to have all their expectations met by some fan-focused film\\, then it would also have to be derivative and predictable. Original > predictable any day.","true":true}
