Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography is beautiful\\, but everything else is abysmal. The film feels like two separate movies\\, both of which suffer from poor tone and pacing. It's message is undermined by everything leading up to it. Most characters are flat\\, and have little to no development. Above all else\\, it disregards the Star Wars universe; everything that previous films and canon stories have built up\\, The Last Jedi has thrown away for the sake of surprise. Subverting expectations for the sake of subverting expectations doesn't translate well in a film in a franchise trying to remain consistent.","true":true}
