Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was an amazing experience from start to finish. I felt a range of emotions as I journeyed across the game. Those who are confused or dislike the story have their own opinion but I am so glad to see others understand the complex story that Naughty Dog has presented with this game. If you don\u2019t care about the story\\, the game has other attributes that make it an outstanding masterpiece. For instance\\, updated graphics\\, gameplay mechanics and a whole sort of new additives that come in many more forms that you will find as you play. I wanted to say that I played the original game and fell in love with the world and the characters and it\u2019s this love that I have for the game that helped me to get past the spoilers and the hateful comments to that went against it after the leak. And I was so happy that I chose to play the game despite the leak because the leaks no not show or depict the game in full. Lastly\\, I would also like to mention that it takes an open mind coming into this game like it does for most things in life but it truly does reward you for your open mindedness by delivering a thoughtful and well written paralleled story. Abby is justified in her actions\\, Joel is justified in his and so is Ellie in the end with hers. Everyone has two sides to them\\, a good side and a bad one. No one is perfect. Except\\, this game... this game is perfect. GO PLAY IT !!!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
