Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely some cringe worthy moments. I know it\u2019s space fantasy... but at some point you do have adopt simple physics into the storyline. There\u2019s more than a handful of completely pointless arcs and characters\/cameos. One of the worst movies in the franchise.","true":true}
