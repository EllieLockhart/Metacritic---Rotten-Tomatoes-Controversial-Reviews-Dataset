Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't a perfect movie\\, and I won't pretend it is. It definitely left some answers I was hoping we'd get unanswered and threw in some curve balls with some characters that I wasn't expecting and maybe would have thought they'd do a little differently.. However\\, I did enjoy it overall and would see it again and buy it when it comes out on digital.","true":true}
