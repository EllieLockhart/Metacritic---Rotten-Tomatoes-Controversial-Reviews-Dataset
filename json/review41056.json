Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie gets credit for not recreating empire\\, but that's about it. everything built up in TFA\\, who is snoak\\, who are Rey's parents. what happened to the new Jedi. Everything I was wanting answered in a way that enhanced the story\\, just felt like they were thrown back in your face with non answers This just felt like a Marvel movie where I couldn't care less about what happens with all the stupid quips. Some of the effects we're great\\, and some of them were just inexcusable. Some characters just served as shallow tools to attempt to increase tension which failed. Ultimately this movie fails to deliver any tension. The heros are impervious\\, never feel as if they are in any real danger. It does deliver on some of the coolest shots I've ever seen in star wars but also the worst. ","true":true}
