Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who thinks this movie owes them anything is wrong. It broke the chains of the past\\, as it called out in the battle between Kyle and Rei. This is exactly what Star Wars needed. I can\u2019t wait to see how this is tied up in Episode IX","true":true}
