Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been a big Starwars fan\\, but atleast i could watch them and enjoy the growth of the characters\\, These characters do not have the same value to them and feel overly forced\\, The first one was a glorified remake and this one seems to have neglected the first ones story threads\\, I dont get it.","true":true}
