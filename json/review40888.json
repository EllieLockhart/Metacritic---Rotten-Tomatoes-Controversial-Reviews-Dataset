Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie definitely did not go the way I thought it would and yet I loved it. It is very different from every other Star Wars movie and I completely understands why many people didn't like it. \\nSo many things happened\\, it is dark but there's a lot of humour (which sometimes bothered me I must admit it). \\nI absolutely loved all the scenes with Rey and Luke. And it was so cool to see Poe Dameron get more screen time. Some storylines were useless unfortunately.\\nCarrie Fisher performance was amazing and brought me to tears.","true":true}
