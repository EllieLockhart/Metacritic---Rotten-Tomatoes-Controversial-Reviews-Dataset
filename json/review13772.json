Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found it enjoyable and entertaining enough that it had my attention for the full (very long) length of the feature - a success in and of itself!  Sure\\, it was convoluted and many questions were left hanging\\, but it's part two of a trilogy\\, after all... nothing I wasn't expecting\\, and great fun from my perspective in any case.  I'll be seeing this one again!","true":true}
