Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I am a pretty big Star Wars fan\\, and I did not feel disappointed walking out of the theater - I felt pretty darn pleased! I am in absolute agreement with many of the answers we received (Rey's parentage\\, for example - it's how it should be!)\\, and I was pleasantly surprised with just how funny this movie was. Considering how dark scenes can be\\, those spots of comedy were very welcome - I never thought the comedy was forced.\\n\\nAlso\\, the porgs are everything I didn't realize I needed. They may seem like a cash grab for merchandising\\, but these are everything that the Ewoks should have been!\\n\\nThis truly felt like a Star Wars saga movie - unlike Rogue One\\, which had a very different feel. From credits to credits\\, The Last Jedi (or\\, as I like to call it\\, \\\"The Sass Jedi\\\") has that familiar Star Wars feel that I just could not shake. Welcome to the canon line\\, Episode VIII!","true":true}
