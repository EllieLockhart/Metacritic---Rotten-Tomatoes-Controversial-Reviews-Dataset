Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  I really liked the original Star Wars as well.  The problem is\\, they are the same movie in different clothing\\, as is The Force Awakens.\\n\\nA conflicted bad guy under the thumb of a clear-thinking but evil worse guy does battle with a talented but incompletely trained blood relative good guy\/girl against the giant empire on behalf of the scrappy rebels\\, who mange to heroically take down a huge weapon-machine and fight a seemingly lost cause battle\\, and then there's the force and stuff\\, all the while Americans are cheering for the scrappy rebels oblivious to the fact that we have become the empire.\\n\\nGeorge Lucas is both genius and keen student of mythology\\, and the underpinnings of the Star Wars franchise strike a deep chord in human psychology\\, thus the widespread appeal of the movies.  But this is a one chord symphony and\\, beautiful as it is\\, having now been turned into a McStar Franchise\\, it simply redundantly repeats itself over and over in ever more resplendent emperor's clothing.\\n\\nTaken on it's own merit\\, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I'm glad I went.  If I had never heard of Star Wars before and this was the first movie\\, I would definitely give it 5 stars.  But in the context of the franchise\\, reviewing this movie for me is like sitting down and re-reviewing the same move I've watched half a dozen times before and I find it tiresome.","true":true}
