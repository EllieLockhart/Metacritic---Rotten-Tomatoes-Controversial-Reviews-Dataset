Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi entertained me enough as a film\\, but left me feeling empty in regards to the series. I enjoyed the technical aspects\\, the action\\, the editing\\, and was fine with the cinematography.  That said...  Why?  I feel like there were a few scenes that were written under the influence of Poprocks and Coke\\, and left me with the feeling like my favorite sports team just got knocked out of the playoffs.  Of course I'll see episode 9\\, but with a much lowered bar.","true":true}
