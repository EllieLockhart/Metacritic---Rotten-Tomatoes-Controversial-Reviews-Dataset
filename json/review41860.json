Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible. The script is ridiculous\\, it is so obviously politically correct that it seems a parody of sorts. The acting is incredibly bad; the technology is incoherent. In one seen bombers are used to destroy an Empire ship reminiscent of WW II tactics; does anybody question how do bombs fall in 0 gravity? This movie is an example of what happens when logic\\, a good script and good acting take second place to special effects and being politically correct. What a piece of junk!!!","true":true}
