Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Yeah\\, there's some plot holes\\, and it's a bit long (though I never felt bored or tired or waiting for it to end)\\, but overall it was a ton of fun.","true":true}
