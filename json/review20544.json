Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've just arrived home after being out to see this and am still reeling with shock and surprising anger. Yes\\, I am an OT fan\\, crikey I even enjoyed some of the prequels\\, but this is just a flapping mess from start to finish. I really liked Rogue One\\, great movie and a great Star Wars feel to it. The Force Awakens bugs me on many levels\\, but I still enjoyed about 60 percent of it. The Last Jedi is probably one of the most busiest\\, confusing and poorly written movies I have ever had the misfortune of watching and I simply cannot understand any positivity it is receiving from fans and critics. I can only assume that some cash backhanders were received or there is a lot of genuine mental illness at play.","true":true}
