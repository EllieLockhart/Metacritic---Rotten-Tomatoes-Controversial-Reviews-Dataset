Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To overall describe this movie: This is NOT Star Wars and the makers do not know enough about the previous movies.\\n\\nNow to get into the details. A lot of silly and bad things went into this latest star wars story. Chances of a depressed Luke? Or one that would think of killing his own nephew? This is a man that went on a suicide mission to save the most evil person in the galaxy. What's with the idiotic flying Leia in space and the stupid purple hair from a grumpy lady that knows nothing of commanding. Yeah sure she had a plan.... And killing of Snoke just in a wimp\\, they could've done so much more with him. And sure he can force choke someone from communicating on a hollogram but couldn't see that coming. What's the point of Luke making a force projection if it kills you? Might just go yourself. He could've easily raised his x-wing out of the water with this kind of power. And half the movie scenes were obsolete if you had let them out we still would've able to follow the story. This will be The Last Star Wars I'll ever watch!","true":true}
