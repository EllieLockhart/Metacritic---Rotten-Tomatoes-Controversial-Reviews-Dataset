Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson very purposefully veered left when the audience expected him to go right. And he did it repeatedly throughout the film. Avoiding fan  expectations seemed to be the entire goal of the movie\\, but it did that at the expense of just making the right choice for the story and characters. It's not the worst Star Wars movie\\, but it's probably the most disappointing.","true":true}
