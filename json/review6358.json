Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, please DO NOT LISTEN THEM. these so called fans will never like anything other than the originals. Two generations of movie goers have passed since return of the jedi\\, let the new generation have their chance. The Last Jedi was amazing\\, it would be a shame if you turned back on us\\, the next generation.","true":true}
