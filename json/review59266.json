The second part is much more complicated and therefore more individual.  (I will not speak more specifically\\, so as not to spoil the impression).  This year\u2019s most controversial game for me.  The most complicated and difficult story in every sense.  This is my personal opinion\\, and I perfectly understand why you can hate it\\, what to complain about and what to competently criticize\\, but I loved the game\\, despite the fact that I also disagree with all the scriptwriter's decisions.
