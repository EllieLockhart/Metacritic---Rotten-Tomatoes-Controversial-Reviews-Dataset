Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another furious Star Wars fan who is disrespected by the trash of this awful interpretation of a classic and timeless franchise. Rian Johnson needs to be force choked. The film is bad for SO many reasons. If they do NOT remake this film (Episode 8)\\, Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
