Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was a giant spectacle no more then the movie equivalent of fireworks 1 viewing is enough to satisfy you and not worth viewing a second time\\, compiled fanservice excessive plot holes\\, SJWashing\\, and just pain unecessary scenes it a mess of a movie that should have been focused on and made into 3 movies 1 for the New Order vs Rebels\\, the Casino scene (yes it could have had its own movie)\\, and Luke training Rey.  They jammed way too much into one movie they went as far to rip sequences from both Empire and Return of the Jedi.  I would suggest renting it and not going to the theaters to see it.","true":true}
