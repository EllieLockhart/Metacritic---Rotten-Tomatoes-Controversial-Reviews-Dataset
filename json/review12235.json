Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am in my 50's and I love anything in 3D. I would never of seen this movie in regular format. Over an hour too long. There are so many times the last 1 hour\\, it seemed the movie was finally over but instead it went on and on and on and on and on. Bad acting and very predictable but the scenes in 3D very good. Save your money.","true":true}
