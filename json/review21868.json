Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just made an account to say how terrible the last Jedi was.\\n Disney completely kills the character of Luke Skywalker and not just physically but in values and morality as well. Luke is a selfless hero\\, no way he just decides to give up and retreat to an island and wait for death. Luke would be out there fighting the good fight. Theres also no way he would try to kill Ben Solo\\, Luke beloved he could turn Vader good\\, literally the worst of the worst and yet he feels he has to resort to killing his nephew\\, a man who has not even gone over to the dark side at that point? give me a break. This movie is a character assassination\\, If this was your big plans for the original characters then you should have left them out of the movies\\, you're doing the original chapters and the fans that love them a huge injustice. The only possible explanation\\, is that the people in charge of these movies have never seen the originals and have no idea what the hell Star Wars is about. #### YOU Disney","true":true}
