Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is increeibly disappointing. Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and Kylo Ren are never given a chance to grow in this movie. The only hint of growth we see is them repeating their arcs from Episode 7\\, or being rewritten as different characters in the beginning of the movie and resulting in characters that more closely resemble how they ended in Episode 7. This\\, of course\\, isn't explaining Luke's odd\\, out of place\\, murderous tendencies and the movie's failure to adhere to the logic of the Star Wars Universe (ex. Lightspeed attacks). And let's not forget the movie's portrayal of Leia that was downright insulting. The tone and pacing are also all over the place making this drawn out space chase feel all over the place. I'm honestly surprised that Disney chose such a confused person to take on a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
