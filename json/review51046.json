Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely brilliant movie!! I loved every moment. The visuals are spectacular the story is great and yet again the cast does an amazing job. Rian Johnson did a great job in my opinion\\, John Williams Score was yet again beautiful and was put in the film perfectly\\, and action sequences  was spectacular. I personally don't get the hate\\, I found the character of Rose was good\\, the comedy worked and Luke's story was very believable. I know a lot wanted nostalgia seeing Luke as the great hero again and I would have too but I get why they changed the way he is from what happened in those previous years. Overall \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is pure escapism at its best.. Highly Recommend.","true":true}
