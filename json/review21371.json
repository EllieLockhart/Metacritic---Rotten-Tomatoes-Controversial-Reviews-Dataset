Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will start by saying after reading and listening to several spoiler reviews I didnt think I would enjoy this movie. But those reviews made seeing the movie feel almost like seeing it for a second time instead of a first and I have to say I loved this movie. The risk that it took were well thought out but had a decent payoff in the end. I have to add that I am a casual and not a hardcore fan of Star Wars so while I enjoyed this movie a lot I can understand where some more hardcore fans may or may not enjoy it as much. But in my opinion this was a very solid movie not just feeling like a Star Wars movie but a overall great told story and film.","true":true}
