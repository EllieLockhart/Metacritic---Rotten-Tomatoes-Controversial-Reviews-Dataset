Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but it was really awful. I'll start with the few things I did like (Spoilers from here on out). I really thought the cast overall did a great job portraying their characters and the new ways that the force can be used was really cool. My biggest problems come with the story and the writing. there were multiple examples of dropped subplots\\, little to no backstory of relevant key characters\\, unclear motivations. Everything about it just felt shallow.  It was such a letdown","true":true}
