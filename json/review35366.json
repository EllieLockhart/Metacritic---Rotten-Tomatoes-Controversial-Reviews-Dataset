Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The kids clapped and cheered. My son gave it a standing ovation. Glad for him.\\nA few adults did too. Must have been the Trump voters.\\nI finished my large popcorn and regular Coke 50 minutes into the movie\\, and kept waiting for something to happen to feel some magic. No luck\\, I am afraid.\\nToo many ships appearing sans purpose. Ships hanging in space for the longest time with no purpose. White snow with a red underlay for no purpose.\\nHelicopter shots of a green hill in the sea for no purpose\\, with John Williams and his thousand violins. Wait\\, is this a tourism ad for Ireland or something? Still didn't make we want to go there. Especially if the fishheaded women are going to handle room service.\\nMark Hamill looked like a dwarf transplant\\, culled from the low paid extras of Lord of the Rings. He looked short in every shot - above\\, below\\, sideways\\, and straight ahead. Why couldn't he at least trim his beard?\\nCarrie Fisher had less expression than a bar of soap. Somebody should have told the director that she was already dead\\, God rest her soul.\\nSnoke looked like a bad make up job from a low budget animated movie. Like a cheap Gollum with a robe.\\nKylo Ren looked like he had taken a dozen too many bottles of muscle supplement\\, with a few bottles just for his face. His face stayed the same\\, with or without the mask on.\\nLaura Dern just stood there for about half an hour\\, with nothing to say or do\\, in a pretty ugly grey dress. Couldn't she have said \\\"Banzai!!!!\\\"\\, or something equally suitable\\, as she rammed the baddies ship at light speed?\\nAs for Boyega and that other excitable chap. Well they sure were excited to be in the movie. I wasn't.\\nAnd that bird\\, chicken\\, owl\\, whatever thing was created just to sell merchandise. Where are the Ewoks when you needed them? At least they knocked a few baddies out of the sky.\\nToo many chaps in black Vader like masks - the costume department must have got them cheap on a Halloween sale.\\nWhy can't they hire some Shakespearean actors from England on the cheap? It is space opera after all. And why can't they get some decent writers? And a halfway decent director? And an editor with extra long scissors?\\nRotten Tomatoes has it a 92 percent critics rating. Really?\\nGeorge\\, I want my money back. You have enough by now surely.\\nOh well\\, I do have Episodes 4-6 on DVD.","true":true}
