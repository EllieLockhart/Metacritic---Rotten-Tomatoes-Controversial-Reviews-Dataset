{"101487":131335,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't write reviews\\, but hearing about all these \\\"Star Wars fans\\\" that hate the film gives the impression that the majority of fans weren't pleased with this film. It seems that those who hated it are neither looking at the film critically or viewing the film from the inner child who is pumping their fist in the air whenever Poe Damaron jumps in an X-Wing or Rey turns on a lightsaber.\\n\\nIf looking at this film critically\\, this is the perfect dissection of a Star Wars film. It isn't dark and broody a la Zach Snyder's dissection of heroism\\, but Rian Johnson effectively points out the flaws in Star Wars while opening up the series to move forward with what it truly excels at. This movie doesn't care who is related to who or where which minor character comes from. It's primary concern was giving each character a dramatic story line that spoke to problems with the basic nature of the series\\, only to then help each character move past the weaknesses of past Star Wars films. At the end the series is left to rebuild in a really cool way. The Last Jedi also felt much more like Expanded Universe materials than anything that came before it (particularly the rendezvous to Canto Bight)\\, so in that since it was more Star Wars-y than much that came before.\\n\\nMy inner child was more than impressed. Where The Force Awakens had 2 or 3 moments that gave me that feeling of being a kid again and 1 major twist\\, The Last Jedi goes off the rails. I won't spoil anything\\, but I can count at least 7 moments in The Last Jedi that I was truly surprised by 5 or 6 that made me want to hop in an X-Wing or pull out a lightsaber like I wanted to as a child. Sure\\, the middle was long and less engaging\\, but the book ends of this film were beyond epic in a way that hasn't happened since the Original Trilogy.\\n\\nI think much of the criticism is coming from a place of\\, I thought this lineage mattered or this character is supposed to be important for this reason. But that line of thinking will only take the series so far\\, making each chapter more derivative as time goes on. Johnson\\, like Luke Skywalker\\, chucks the lightsaber off the cliff. Not because there is anything wrong with lightsabers\\, but because after 9 films the series needed to become a better lightsaber. There might be some hyper-drive disruption\\, but ultimately The Last Jedi is a powerful force to be reckoned with that challenges and expands the universe in  a way that is as fresh and explosive as ever.","true":true}
