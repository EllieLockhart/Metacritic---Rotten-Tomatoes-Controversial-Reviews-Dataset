Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is not perfect\\, but it comes pretty close. I could of done without the porgs\\,  and I would have liked Luke to act more like the Luke that we all know and love in the first act of the film\\, but then I remembered two things;  the first one was that Anakin is his dad\\, and the second one is that no matter how awesome Luke is\\, he is still human. Yes\\, Luke shares some of his dad's fantastic traits\\, such as his bravery\\, leadership\\, formidable piloting\\, fighting and \\\"lightsabering\\\" but\\, sadly for us\\, he also always had a bit of his whiny side which seems to have accentuated a bit more in his later years. In addition\\, he is scared and rightfully so\\, these new threats seem far worse than anything he's seen before\\, but in time\\, he gets back to being everything that makes him the hero he was born to be. It is beautiful and poetic when he parts looking at the two suns\\, he goes back to his childhood and teenage years of being no more than a farmer and a dreamer. The film in general is great. It has enough nostalgic elements for us who have loved this story since the 70s\\, and new twists\\, turns and characters to keep us\\, and the new generations interested. I will anxiously and excitedly wait for the next parts of this new-old tale\\, and continue to enjoy being transported to these new beautiful and interesting places that help my heart feel young and content. The movie did it's job of entertaining the public\\, and more importantly\\, it motivates a whole new group of people to write\\, animate\\, direct\\, produce and just create new beautiful things to share with the rest of the world. So\\,  I had my small objections\\, but I left the theatre with a smile. The Last Jedi is definitely worth watching and is a great sequel for not only The Force Awakens\\, but the original trilogy too.","true":true}
