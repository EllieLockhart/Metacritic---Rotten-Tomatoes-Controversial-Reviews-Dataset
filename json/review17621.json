Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is there a way Fans can chip in and return the franchise to Lucas? Because this idiots at Disney are killing it on their own\\, they're killing off every major character of the franchise only to be left with younger and shittier characers of their own\\, even the prequels were good\\, this isn't just garbage","true":true}
