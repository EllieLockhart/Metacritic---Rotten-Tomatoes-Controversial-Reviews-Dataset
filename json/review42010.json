Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS MOVIE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS LIVING THROUGH A DAY IN THE LIFE OF STAR WARS! Amazing storyline and character development. As a Star Wars fanatic I can 100% say it was incredible! Personally favorite Star Wars film to date. Thank you Rian Johnson!","true":true}
