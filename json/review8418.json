Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with unexpected twists\\, inspiring acting\\, stunning visuals and breathtaking action sequences\\, \\\"Last Jedi\\\" is Star Wars at its best\\, offering the most exciting and emotional chapter in the saga since \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and probably the best blockbuster I've seen in a while.","true":true}
