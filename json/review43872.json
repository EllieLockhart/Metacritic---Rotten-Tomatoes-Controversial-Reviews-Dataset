Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle of it as I watched it\\, but afterwards I had too many doubts over plot holes\\, characterisations\\, missed opportunities\\, and the direction going forward. Another skewed remake from the original trilogy that was\\, for me\\, the least of all the films.","true":true}
