Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete spit in the face of pre existing lore as well as an unnecessary change in tone resulting in an obvious display of behind the scenes agendas. A stunning film nonetheless that any movie should aim to look and sound like however if you wanna take story notes you're better off with other fantasy properties.","true":true}
