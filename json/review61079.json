Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So gameplay is so last generation.. Basically no effort to progress the gameplay and gameplay systems from the previous game in the series.\r\rThe story is one dimensional\\, with no character development from the previous game\\, in fact it basically just discards the entire previous game and decides to burn the lot.

It is basically a one dimension revenge story\\, with something of a story that really plays on the worse of us and not progressing any moral improvement but simply just portray everyone as the worse. Marketing of this game and early reviews of the game push the narrative you'll be playing the characters you loved from the original\\, it is not the case\\, basically one of the key characters from first game is basically murdered for the sake of murdering him early in and you then get to play the character that murder for the majority of this trash. There is nothing to love about the new characters\\, nothing attractive or sticky to make you enjoy play the game\\, it is basically all about pointless violence for no reason.\r\rSo writing is basically lazy\\, uninspired\\, and seems to play to the twitter rosenspires and not really to the anyone that is actually a fan of the original game but basically an audience that actually doesn't even play games but love to complain about them.\r\rBasically this game is a waste of time\\, you're never going to get those hours back and tbh you'd be better off grabbing any other game and playing that.\r\rFinally\\, there is a massive double standard with some of the content that Sony have allowed to be in the game in comparison to other titles on PS4.\r\rI want to give this zero\\, but visually this game does have some good art and animation\\, but that is it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
