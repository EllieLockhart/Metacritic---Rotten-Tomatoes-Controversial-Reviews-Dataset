Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode in the franchise was plodding and I cannot get those 2.5 hours of my life back. It ranks at the bottom of all the Star Wars movies. I sense a bias on RT. Justice League gets a pan while Star Wars gets a 'Fresh' rating while the fans have the opposite reaction? Hmmmmmmm","true":true}
