Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it in IMAX 3D and it was well worth it (more for the scale than the 3D effects).\\n\\nI really liked the movie. I remember being in my seat\\, heart racing\\, and excited to take in every moment of the action sequences (Same feeling I got with the Millennium Falcon fight early in TFA). And as much as I liked the Marvel stuff\\, none of those movies in recent years put me on the edge of my seat me like the last two Star Wars.\\n\\nI felt the direction they took with the characters were different and interesting\\, while I do agree with most in that certain sections of the movie should of been edited out or reworked. However for a 2.5 hour movie\\, the pacing of those lulls in the movie wasn't so bad that it felt like a 2.5 hour movie.\\n\\nI saw some YouTube reviews after the movie and honestly all the negative points people bring up generally didn't bother me at all.\\n\\nMaybe I'm in the minority but I can still get lost in a movie without nit picking everything in the moment. I find it ironic that fans who nitpick and criticize The Last Jedi\\, are only able to have such a strong opinion because at some point they got lost in the fantasy of it and accepted it for what it is.\\n\\nTo me\\, this movie displayed superior writing\\, directing\\, pacing\\, action\\, and acting than Justice League\\, and yet the Audience Score on that is 79%\\, hell even BVS has a 63% right now\\, while we're currently at 55% (as I write this) for TLJ... and I think that says something.","true":true}
