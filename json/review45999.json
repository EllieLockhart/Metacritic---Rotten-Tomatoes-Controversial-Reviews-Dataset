Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"visually its looks great  and the acting its good but thats the only positives i could see from this film\\, its very badly written\\, edited  and directed. there are problems with character motivations\\, pointless plot threads in the film that do not need to be there but feel they are there to fill a void or lack of script. \\,","true":true}
