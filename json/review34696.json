Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics are wrong. This is an average sci-fi film but a very poor Star Wars film. I enjoyed Rogue One and The Force Awakens\\, both have issues but are masterpieces compared to this mess of a movie. I wanted to love it\\, I would have settled for a patchy film but this feels like they have killed off any interest in episode 9 for me anyway.","true":true}
