Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie that broke the star wars universe.  Approximately 30 minutes of the film was useless when Admiral Holdo refuses to share her heroic plan with the rest of the group.  Luke rolls over and dies for no reason.  \\nTruly a terrible movie.","true":true}
