Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have a new reverence for episode 1 now. As goofy as it was at least there was character development and story building. With this movie\\, for the most part\\, it\u2019s just too similar too episode 5 in a lot of the story and dialogue. It also tries to be too funny and bounces around way too much and has storylines that are unnecessary or make no sense. ","true":true}
