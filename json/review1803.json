Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a true Star wars fan I have to say this movie was a betrayal to true fans and  an attempt to further mainstream Star Wars. I would rather watch 2h of Rebels than this movie. In my opinion this movie has far too many loopholes\\, from a non trained force sensitive person flying through space\\, to the disaster of what Snoke's story was. This movie might be considered good by critics\\, but for me it is a true fans worst nightmare. Feels nothing like the Star Wars I grew up with and fell in love with. RIP star wars","true":true}
