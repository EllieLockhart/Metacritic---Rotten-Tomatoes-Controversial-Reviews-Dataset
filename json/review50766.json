Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful\\, flashy film\\, with a plot that makes no sense at all\\, a strong desire to push half baked political allegories and a total lack of respect for hero of the series. It gets worse with each viewing and despite the solid production values and good performances\\, this is the worst Star Wars film by far.","true":true}
