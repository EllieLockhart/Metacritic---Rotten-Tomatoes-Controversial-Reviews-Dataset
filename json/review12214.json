Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure what all these nay sayers are going on about. It was an amazing\\, entertaining experience! I get the feeling all the trolls got together without even watching the film and decided to go input 1 Star. This is not a 1 Star movie. Go see it. So worth it. ","true":true}
