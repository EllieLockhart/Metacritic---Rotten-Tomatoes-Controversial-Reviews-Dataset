Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked when Rey was stronger than weak Kylo.\\nI liked when Yoda destroyed all remaining history of Jedi.\\nI liked when Luke milked a Lochness monster\\, that was funny\\, I clapped.\\nI liked porg!\\nI liked crystal fogs!\\nI liked hero asian strong woman!\\nI liked when they used hyperspace to do kamikaze as first people ling time ago but for the first time! Genius!\\nI liked when Leia survived because the Force is Female!\\nI liked when Snoke didn't expect shit! Hahaaa!\\nThat epic battle with Snokes guards! They really worked on the choreography. Rey is a real Jedi!\\nI liked everything because I am programmed to respond to these familiar visuals and I don't even need to use my brain!","true":true}
