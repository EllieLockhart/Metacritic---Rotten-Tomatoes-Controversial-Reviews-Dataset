Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MARCH 2018 - I FINALLY WATCHED LAST JEDI\\nTHE GOOD: \\n-SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE WELL DONE\\n-THE SETS LOOKED GREAT\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\n-THE STORY AND WRITING WERE WEAK\\n-THE CASTING WAS HORRIBLE.  I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING THIS SJW STARWARS.  DIVERSITY FOR THE SAKE OF DIVERSITY DOES NOT WORK.  THE CASTING DECISIONS BROKE IMMERSION SO MANY TIMES I LOST COUNT.\\n-ROSE'S CHARACTER WAS BEYOND USELESS\\n-THE DECISION'S THE REBEL LEADERSHIP MADE WERE JUST SILLY...THAT'S NOT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nOVER ALL I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE.\\n\\nI'M DONE WITH STAR WARS.","true":true}
