Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was bored to the point of agitation.  Rey's character was fine.  Luke Skywalker-- Mark Hammil\\, I'm sorry\\, could't believe the cardboard performance.  And don't get me started on the Kylo Ren actor -- as bad as that awful thing that played a young Darth Vader.  For me a real snoozer.  In fact\\, I walked out after 1:15 mark.  Ugh.  Sad.","true":true}
