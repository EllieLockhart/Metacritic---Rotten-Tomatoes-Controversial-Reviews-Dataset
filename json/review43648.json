Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was painful. Watch Mark Hamill's warnings that he gave ... he knew ... and they ignored him and made this mess. Script and story are a train wreck\\, Finn and Rey were given so little to do ... This film injured our hopes and dreams for new characters and old alike. Luke drinking the alien milk ... why????  The fact that critics praised it beforehand ... suspect. If you feel the same\\, speak out!","true":true}
