Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I joined just to be able to get this off my chest.\\n\\nWhat are the critics thinking?\\n\\n****Spoilers****\\n\\n\\n\\nThis movie went wrong in so many ways. It's like they decided to ignore all of the questions set up in TFA. And then\\, they decided to add insult to injury and make the movie like a Robot Chicken Episode.\\n\\nIs this Robot Chicken Judo? Like\\, make fun of it first and steal their energy kind of thing?\\n\\nFinn and New girls's Plot was pointless. Poe Dameron's Mutiny was pointless. Luke's chucking the lightsaber away was dumb and insulting.\\n\\n\\nPrincess Leia's floating\\, force space Jesus moment was pointless and needlessly insulting (and looked beyond cheesy!!!).\\n\\nAnd then there are the missed opportunities. The critics talk about Rian Johnson taking risks. Uh\\, no. He had a chance to but chickened our. A Rey\/Ren teamup? That would have been interesting and original. And daring. \\n\\nBut sorry no: Fooled You (said like Dark Helmet). They just jerked you around and then went back to business as normal.\\n\\nAnother lost opportunity: Billy Dee Williams. What is the mother effing point of Benicio Del Toro's lame\\, pointless character? Imagine if the man they had been sent to look for was Lando Calrissian? \\nThey would have been cheering in the aisles.\\n\\nTerrible\\, terrible movie.","true":true}
