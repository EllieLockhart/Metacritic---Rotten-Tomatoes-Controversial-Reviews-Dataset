Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to write this\\, and i may change my mind after several views of this movie\\, but i cannot give more than 2\/5. One star is for the great performances from Mark Hammil and Kylo's character as well as the attempt to make things differently. Another one for the overal execution of the movie\\, which included quite some scenes and elements i really liked.\\n\\nBut some major issues are dragging this one down\\, and they are quite heavy. There are so many decisions without any logic and a complete sub-plot with Finn\\, which simply should not have been in this movie at all. I came out of the cinema not really knowing what to think\\, but it became more and more hollow\\, that i could not really believe what i have just seen.\\n\\nThey have destroyed almost every mystery and excitement created with EP7\\, which i was looking forward to be developed deeper in the next two episodes until the epic finale to be expected at the end of the trilogy.\\n\\nI really appreciate the risks they have taken with this movie\\, which were definitely a reaction to the mainstreamed EP7\\, but i have to say that EP8 is very well executed\\, but ultimately fails on so many levels that really pisses me off.","true":true}
