Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you liked the prequels\\, you'll like TLJ. So much potential\\, so much to work with\\, and it felt like it was written and edited by a first-time fanfic hack. It definitely had it's moments\\, and gave a great deal of fan service\\, but in the end it seems that Lucas' shadow still looms strong.","true":true}
