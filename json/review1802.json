Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a true fan of Star Wars\\, (unlike those who feel it is their right to harass\\, inflict pain and abuse on Writer\/Director Rian Johnson and actresses Daisy Ridley and Kelly Marie Tran) this is a very worthy follow-up to Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\, with an excellent executed storyline and directing by Mr. Johnson\\, incredible acting\\, dazzling visual effects\\, sweeping musical score by the legendary John Williams\\, incomparable cinematography by Steve Yedlin\\, well crafted editing by Bob Ducsay\\, set pieces by Rick Heinrichs\\, and costumes designed by Michael Kaplan! The Best Star Wars Fiim since The Empire Strikes Back! For those out there who decided to give up on Star Wars\\, you will miss out on what is yet to come!","true":true}
