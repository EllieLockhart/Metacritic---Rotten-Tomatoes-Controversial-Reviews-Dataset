Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a bit surprised at some of the negativity I am seeing. We saw the movie Thursday night. The pacing is solid and the story is innovative. The callbacks are clear\\, but not invasive.\\n\\nEverything about The Last Jedi is about renewal\\, stepping past the trappings of the institutions that have enslaved the galaxy for 1000 years.\\n\\nThis film is not for the shallow. While embracing everything that has been Star Wars for 40 years\\, it also asks us to take the next step and look inside to find out who *we* are.\\n\\nThe theater was packed\\, which is unusual for the early premier night\\, and the movie closed to a standing ovation. Opinions here seem to be all over the map\\, but everyone who shared the theater with us enjoyed it.","true":true}
