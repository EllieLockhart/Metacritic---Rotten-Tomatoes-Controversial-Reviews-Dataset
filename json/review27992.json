Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor writing and pacing\\, an overall lack of focus\\, and a failure to achieve any momentum until the final act doom this movie. For the first 90 minutes or so\\, the story cuts away to the other side of the galaxy every time anything interesting threatens to happen. The main characters follow random motivations like dogs hunting squirrels while the actors gamely try to imbue their frenetic actions with meaning. Sadly\\, there is no cohesive vision\\, no singular artistic voice. This feels like a film made by committee. Celebrity casting has also gone too far...dead-end characters played by famous people clutter the story\\, none more so than Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro (actors I like but whose characters just don\u2019t work in this film). The moment that was so beautifully set up at the end of The Force Awakens is trashed at the beginning of The Last Jedi. Apparently our long-suffering patience for one brilliant\\, soulful gaze from Luke at the end of Episode 7 was not considered worthy of reward in Episode 8. Yes\\, Luke has a few great moments at the end. But by that point\\, the film is one bloated\\, wasted opportunity. I don\u2019t blame the actors. In general\\, I feel they did a fine job. Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and John Boyega manage to connect emotionally with the audience as much as the writing allows. Even Adam Driver as Kylo Ren matures nicely this go-round. As usual\\, John Williams\u2019 score is brilliant and I cannot wait to listen to it by itself. Oh yeah\\, and the Porgs were both cute and hilarious so I\u2019ll give some credit there. I recognize that this was an attempt at originality\\, and I agree that a fresh story was needed. Unfortunately\\, this was a failed attempt. As recycled as The Force Awakens was\\, the story worked. This story does not\\, and the recycling\\, particularly from Return of the Jedi (ie. the confrontation with Snoke\\, the final shot on the Island\\, and the climactic space battle) and Empire Strikes Back (ie. the assault-on and evacuation-of the rebel base) continues.","true":true}
