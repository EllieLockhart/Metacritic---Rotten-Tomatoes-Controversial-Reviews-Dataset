{"101487":198252,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars ever. Let me break it down. Spoliers AHEAD:\\n\\n1.The casino scene\\, finn and the girl development just didn't need to happen\\, you practically could have killed off finn the first film since he just wasn't needed\\, hence you wasted maybe half an hour of people's time.\\n\\n2. The whole star wars lore and character development. This is where i just needed to create an account just to express my personal rage at this film. Let's begin with snoke\\, the shady character that made us all go wow. Many rumours spread across the internet of him being Darth Plagiues or one of the first jedi turned bad hence maybe that was the reason he was in charge of the FIRST order. So\\, many rumors came to pass and we were all hyped\\, let's be honest for a luke vs snoke moment or at least some spectrum of how powerful or how long he has been around for. But in this case he was killed off instantly. Just a question\\, why would you kill of someone\\, you have being bigging up since TFA just to kill them instantly in the second one it just makes no sense to me\\, the development of his character really drawn me to this film and just got shut down when he died. From that moment it went from being possibly a 6\/10 to like a 2\/10. Oh by the way the comedy\\, the comedy was not funny at all\\, it made me cringe so much\\, since when has star wars ever been funny\\, yeah they made a couple of jokes here and there to add that sense of human interaction but my god\\, when the first order is talking to poe\\, imagine that scene in ANH with that general in charge who looks scary as\\, you just could not imagine it\\, the humor just would not work. Humor existed in those films to gain character development and likeable people. imagine vader being funny\\, it just cannot work\\, ever heard the term more is less\\, well you should learn from that. \\n\\n3. Luke is the best\\, obviously and has been around since the originals\\, his character has been fantastic from the start\\, who was he\\, his goals\\, what drove him\\, who his family were etc. which is great. he becomes broken in this film which is good to see\\, at the end though\\, why did you think it was a good idea to have him as a force projection just to kill him off at the same outcome ? a lot of this film will make your head hurt with questions trust me. Would it not be more suitable for him to go to the actual place and fight off Kylo normally and Kylo strike him down ? because in the end the outcomes were both the same and begs the questions again\\, how the hell did he die from using his force powers\\, whoever the hell says \\\"because it took it all out of him\\\" is a load of crap since why was that power designed to be there in the first place if it kills jedi's (laugh face with crying tears) that's what makes me go wtf. Hey we got this new power come through today\\, you can only use it once in your life though\\, the other jedi goes\\, why only once ? the other jedi repsonds 'oh because it will kill you afterwards' it just makes no sense. Rian Johnson really hasn't thought this through. I actually could go on and on about so many points in this film that just did not connect\\, oh one final overview\\, how does luke know about snoke since we've never seen them meet or interact\\, how does Kylo know about snoke since we have never seen them interact when luke was training him ? So how the hell did all this come together. Snoke just comes up to him in his tent at night\\, \\\"hey kid wanna turn to the dark side ?\\\" there is just soooo many things to ask that a story\\, well A GOOD STORY should straighten out\\, but since this is just a cluster of disney shite the story has so many loose ends. You NEED that development in a story to really grasp a character since the only people i actually care about dieing is luke and leia\\, the others could die and i would not care less\\, rey and kylo just do not have that emotional attachment to go OMG to so when critics say emotion - rich well ermm not quite. P.S - and r.i.p Carrie Ficsher huge fan and loved her to bits\\, why did the director not decide to kill her off there\\, it would of made people go Noo and have there hearts pour out to her which is what you want in a stroy\\, to drive people's emotion. instead she floats back to the spaceship like Buzz Lightyear. Dude Rian Johnson or whoever you are\\, you just do not know star wars and it's principles or for that fact how to actually tie together a story. 1\/10","true":true}
