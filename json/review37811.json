{"101487":178773,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were obviously a lot of issues with this movie\\, but I'm gonna focus on the reveal of Rey's parents\\, because rian Johnson seems super defensive of his decision. The move annoyed me to the point that I actually created an account just to post this review. Johnson claimed that this was some sort of a twist a la \\\"I am your father.\\\" He said that in episode V\\, finding out that Vader was Luke's father was the one thing neither Luke nor the audience wanted to hear\\, making it a perfect twist. Johnson then went on to say that likewise\\, finding out that Rey was a nobody was the one thing Rey and the audience wouldn't want to find out. This comparison to one of the greatest films ever made and far and away the best SW movie was a total joke\\, and frankly an insult to the classics\\, but that wasn't nearly the biggest issues with his comments. The real problem is that he clearly doesn't know the difference between the words \\\"shocked\\\" and \\\"disappointed.\\\" \\n\\nI'll dismantle his explanation in two parts: For starters\\, he says that Rey wouldn't want to find out she's a nobody\\, comparing it to Luke. The reason Luke didn't want to be vaders kid is pretty obvious: he's committed to the light\\, and vaders on the dark side. But with Rey\\, the reasoning is a bit less clear. I'm sure we could infer that Rey feels like she has to be \\\"somebody\\\" to be a part of this story\\, as Kylo says. Unfortunately\\, inferring major character development points would be about as ridiculous as\\, say\\, the greatest Jedi ever dying because he tired himself out by using too much force or whatever. The previous movies seemed to make no real mention of Rey's fear of inferiority\\, and the only time we got a hint is earlier in the movie when Rey tells Luke that she's from \\\"nowhere\\,\\\" Luke replies \\\"everyone's from somewhere\\,\\\" Rey says \\\"I'm from jakku\\,\\\" aaaand.........Luke makes a stupid quip (\\\"wow I guess you really are from nowhere\\\" (says the guy from tatooine))\\, bringing the count of Guardians of the Galaxy humor ruining a key scene to a billion. I wouldn't have minded if Rey was just a new character with no connections\\, but since they didn't mention it when her character was introduced\\, and they never made us think that her lack of important parents would advance her character\\, the reveal just became a poor attempt at wow-factor shock. A move like this should not be a surprise due to lack of context.\\n\\nThe second part of Johnson's comment\\, that the audience didn't want to hear that she was a nobody\\, again falls flat with the episode V comparison. Not wanting to hear about vaders connection to Luke is about a twist you could never expect and the seemingly impossible relationship between two opposite characters. The Rey \\\"twist\\,\\\" however\\, is far different from that. The reason the audience didn't want to hear it was because of build up\\, not because of preconceived notions of how movies characters should work. JJ Abrams (bless his soul) set up a perfect situation for Johnson\\, complete with compelling questions that sparked God knows how many fan theories and speculations. The possibilities were endless. Then\\, even in this movie\\, Johnson built the suspense (the dark side hole where Rey asks about her parents). Clearly\\, the build up of her parentage reveal was important to the trilogy. But\\, then\\, just like that\\, it all came crashing down. This slap-in-the-face-of-fans move would be like if someone told you that they were giving you a gift\\, and that they thought that what it was was pretty obvious\\, and for two years they dangled it in front of your face\\, and then\\, on the day of the reveal\\, they told you \\\"I bet you can't wait to open this\\,\\\" and then when you finally tear off the wrapping paper\\, open up the large box\\, and clear away the packing peanuts\\, you find a single paper clip\\, with the explanation being that the day before your friend bought you it you'd mentioned that you needed one to attach two papers. If that's rian Johnson's idea of twist\\, I think I would've rather had M Night Shyamalan direct TLJ.\\n\\nAfter spending money on opening night tickets and popcorn for about the same price as a new BMW\\, I walked out of the theater so insulted that I didn't even notice the tribute to Carrie Fisher at the end. Not only did the snoke throne room scene (which I actually thought was one of the few great ones in the movie\\, along with the yoda one) give us a painful end to the Rey's parents question\\, but it also potentially ends any possibility of finding out snokes identity (he's dead! What a twist!) and the seemingly forgotten burning question of how Maz Kanada obtained possession of Luke's lightsaber which feel down the shaft in cloud city (the lightsaber was torn in half\\, though Rey  does have the pieces at the end so maybe she repairs it and we'll get an answer). Also\\, side note\\, where the hell are the Knights of Ren? JJ Abrams has really got his work cut out for him. Ultimately\\, if you're a casual movie goer who just wants an enjoyable enough movie\\, TLJ is for you. However\\, if you're at all invested in the characters\\, the original trilogy\\, and the answers to potentially franchise altering questions\\, you're going to be royally pissed off.","true":true}
