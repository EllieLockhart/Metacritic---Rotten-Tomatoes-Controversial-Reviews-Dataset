Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In spite of stand-out moments and brave story choices\\, The Last Jedi is a failed attempt at storytelling. From convenient plotlines\\, gaps in logic\\, inappropriate humour\\, to character arcs set up in previous films that were not followed through\\, The Last Jedi seems like a film with a mission to subvert all our expectations and be so unpredictable that the Director forgot the essential ingredients that go into making a movie great - believable characters and strong storylines. I feel that somewhere within Rian Johnson's broad strokes is a genuinely good story waiting to be told\\, hence my attempt at a re-write that stays true to the Star Wars mythos while at the same time channelling Rian Johnson's derring-do\\, so that we can have at least on paper a film that is a worthy follow-up to The Force Awakens and the Star Wars saga: https:\/\/medium.com\/@christopherminjoot\/save-the-last-jedi-cd59b8939ff1","true":true}
