Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At all turns director Rian Johnson finds ways to disappoint audiences.\\n\\nJohnson's decisions to essentially write off entire plot threads from the previous film is felt throughout the entire film. While not all criticism belongs to Johnson\\, a very large part does fall onto him. The Last Jedi continues the trend of forcing characters of more ethnicity into it with a total disregard for pacing or the plot.  While I thoroughly enjoy John Boyega's \\\"Fin\\\" as a character\\, the same cannot be said for Kelly Marie Tran's \\\"Rose\\\".  The entire movie suffers from the forced plot of Rose and Fins (somewhat romantic) story\\, and their exposition to the casino world of \\\"Canto Bight.\\\" \\n\\nLaura Dern is an amazing actress\\, one of my favorites of all time in fact. However the script for the movie makes her a unneeded and generally confusing character. \\n\\nWhile they're are some bright parts in the film\\, I'm honestly very disappointing with the film\\, Disney\\, Lucasfilm\\, and most importantly Rain Johnson. The film as a whole suffers from poor writing and general disregard for the source materials. Johnson fails not only himself\\, but the fans of this much beloved series.","true":true}
