Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much wrong with this \\\"film.\\\" An inane plot\\, an angry feminist rebellion\\, anti-capitalist hate\\, and an overtly homosexual starring the main villain. They even shove in our face an interracial love brewing between a black and an Asian - absolutely despicable. It is clear that politically correct SJWs have their hands all over this film. They must be purged from our society. The Star Wars we cherished as kids is finished. MAGA!!!","true":true}
