Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of major issues: Where are the Nights of Ren? Really\\, she's a nobody after all the hype? I could go on with the other plot holes. Why didn't Leia die? We all expected it? We all were hoping for a satisfying grand send off\\, but LUKE goes?  So stupid.  The Rey\/Ren thing was good.  I love them\\, but they were both better written in the TFA.   The Shuttle scene was stupid and dragged out.  Poe doesn't have any remorse from having 100s of ppl get killed?  The boy with broom was stupid (why can he just do that and it took Luke a lot of training?) UGH\\, so many awesome plot lines to chose from and Rian goes and does his OWN thing to be 'different'. The humor was right out of Space Balls.","true":true}
