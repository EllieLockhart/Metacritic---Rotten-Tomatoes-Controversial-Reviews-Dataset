Gameplay portion is literally the same as last game and i already though that the first game's mechanics were mediocre at best but the story and the characters made up for it\\, on the other hand we have an opposite situation here. The story is god awful\\, pacing is terrible (especially in places where there are flashbacks\\, like those could have been switched around to ease up the dramatic twists happening super early in the game)\\, and the characters' actions make no sense. You know some of these characters from the first game\\, you know how they act and carry themselves around but here IT MAKES NO SENSE WHAT THEY DO.  The theme is the most generic thing ever compared to the unique theme of the first game. Overall dont even bother\\, I'm only giving a 4 because of how good the graphics are and the writing in the flashbacks were pretty decent\\, otherwise it would be a complete 0.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
