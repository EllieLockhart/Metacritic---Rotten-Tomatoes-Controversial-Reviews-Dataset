Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as I thought considering the ratings here. I saw the original trilogy in the theater when I was a kid\\, and have been obsessed with those particular 3 movies at different points in my childhood and adulthood. I wasn't a huge fan of the prequel. Luke was always my favorite character and I waited for something like 35 years to see him again. I was okay with what was done. I kind of liked the fact that all the guilt and angst that made him my favorite was still there\\, and even heavier\\, with a little bit of both the Obi Wan and Yoda asthetic. That being said\\, the movie does get a bit long\\, and I feel like they squished all of Empire Strikes Back and part of Return of the Jedi into it\\, but I am interested to see where it goes now. it's a visual masterpiece. see it in IMAX 3D if you can.","true":true}
