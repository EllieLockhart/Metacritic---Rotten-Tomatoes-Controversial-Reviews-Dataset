Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has some great flickers of greatness\\, but is ultimately weighed down be less the mediocre understanding of characters both new and old and a reverence for the new trilogies arch or the saga as a whole.\\n\\nRain Johnson would have been a great choice to direct a one off or his upcoming trilogy\\, the casino world was a total showstopper and felt like a hamfisted prequal era holdover\\, and way to say \\\"look\\, I get Star Wars is for kids... right?\\\".\\n\\nI could go on\\, but I'll let redlettermedia do it or any other critic who isn't in disneys pocket.","true":true}
