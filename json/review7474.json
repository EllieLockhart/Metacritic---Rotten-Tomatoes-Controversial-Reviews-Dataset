Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even though\\, this movie has gotten many bad reviews I truly believe this film is defiantly one of the best in the series. The movie has a great yet bittersweet message\\, with amazing twists. The characters are so well done that they make the story go beyond a good vs. evil plot line. Good job\\, to Rian Johnson.","true":true}
