Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in having heard audiences weren't too impressed. (The audience score on MetaCritic is even worse than here). But nothing could have prepared me for HOW BAD this was!\\nAs unoriginal as TFA was\\, it was still a great movie and totally captured the spirit of the originals. But TLJ felt like a parody! \\n\\nNow I see why there's a PETITION to protest it on the Change website.\\n\\nGoogle: \\\"Henry Walsh\\\" \\\"Have Disney Strike Episode VIII from official Canon\\\" and sign it! \\nDisney won't do it of course but its a good way to send a message to them!","true":true}
