Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As Star Wars films go\\, I find Last Jedi middle of the road. I don't find it highly offensive the way the people that loathe this movie do\\, nor do I think it's anywhere close to cinematic brilliance\\, which a lot of OTHER people seem to claim. Yes\\, how Luke is handled is offensive and frustrating\\, and it undoes much of what Force Awakens set up (even though it was a weak set-up due to Abrams' over-reliance on his Mystery Box method of storytelling\\, which favors setting up mysteries but never seems to stick the landing well). It wastes actors and their characters on plots that ultimately do nothing to grow them. It sidelines the agency of the three new heroes and robs them of a chance at a strong character arc.\\n\\nWhat this film did right\\, though was it structured itself very well around its central themes (let the past die\\, failure as a teacher)\\, and from a purely constructionist standpoint\\, it was very well done. Unfortunately\\, this sort of myth-deconstructing arc does not sit well in the Star Wars franchise\\, and will ultimately be seen as a misstep for the franchise (along with the rest of the trilogy\\, including the much\\, much worse Rise of Skywalker).\\n\\nThere must be purpose behind subverting the audience's expecations\\, and when you do decide to go that route\\, it's a much harder job to nail the execution. Last Jedi plays at greatness\\, but ultimately fumbles the ball. One can commend Johnson and the studio for taking the chance (unlike the safe retread of Force Awakens)\\, but the failure ultimately fractured an already fractious built-in audience.","true":true}
