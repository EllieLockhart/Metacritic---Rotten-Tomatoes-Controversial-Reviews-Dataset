Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"an okay movie to watch just as a single movie 3 star as a single move\\, but!!! in the hands off the trilogy it was awful plot holes many\\, it changes the form of battles with ficghters and stuff like that. like now a transport with ligtspeed can destroy a star destroyer. as a star wars fan do not use money on this do not give disney the will to keep making star wars a disgrace","true":true}
