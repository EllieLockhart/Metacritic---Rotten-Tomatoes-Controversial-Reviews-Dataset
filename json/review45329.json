Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter junk. Thanks Disney. You did it again. This movie has no thought put into the story. And why should it? Disney expects to make a new Star Wars movie every year. Lucas spent years writing his scripts. And they at least made sense regardless of if you liked the execution of them or not. Disney just seems content to play off nostalgia and rip off literally every aspect of the old movies shot for shot\\, line for line. I won\u2019t ruin it for those who haven\u2019t seen it by giving specifics but if you want to learn more about the Star Wars universe or the story of these characters you can skip this movie. Literally nothing is revealed. Lucas is looking more and more like a genius with every Disney release. ","true":true}
