Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not a very good movie and an awful Star Wars movie. After setting a serious tone with practical effects in The Force Awakens\/Rogue One Disney decided that this movie needed more CGI and Guardians of the Galaxy comedy. Did you like the prequels? Well then maybe you'll like this. Anyone who cheered the first movie for getting the franchise \\\"back on track\\\" will be horrified. \\n\\nRidiculous CGI animals with no purpose other than to be a stuffed animal sold to kids? Check. \\nExtended dead end plotlines to give a character \\\"something to do\\\"? Check. \\nUnsatisfying answers to Star Wars lore? Check. \\nMain characters deliberately ignoring glaring facts or acting completely against their previously established nature just to bulldoze the plot forward? Check. \\n\\nFrankly\\, I'm stunned that this has a 93% \\\"Certified Fresh\\\" rating from critics - did we watch the same movie? What's going on here?","true":true}
