Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so in love with this franchise. The last Jedi is the last time I see a Star Wars movie in theatre. Besides the very confusing storytelling and incoherent movtivations\\, all threads from previous movies were ignored or rewritten. I don't understand who's running the show over at Disney. If it didn't say Star Wars in the title\\, this would not have been so well received. I'm starting to rethink the aggregator of rotten tomatoes. My heart is broken.","true":true}
