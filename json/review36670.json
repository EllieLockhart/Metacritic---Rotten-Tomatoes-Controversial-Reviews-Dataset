Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is one of the best Star Wars movies made. The best things about it are the unexpected turns the viewer has to cope with. It is not an easy movie\\, be aware that you have to give your own interpretation of things","true":true}
