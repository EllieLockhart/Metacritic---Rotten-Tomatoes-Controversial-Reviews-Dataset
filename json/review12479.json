Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot say how much I hated episode 7 \\, yet episode 8 had something different to offer \\, something new \\, that feeling where I'm not too sure where the story is going . I'm proud to say that I saw nothing in terms of previews or trailers prior to.viewing it \\, and my expectations were really really low . I believe that's why I enjoyed it. sure it was not what I expected .. not at all ... and there are a lot of missed hits for this movie \\, mostly in the writing .. sure \\, some characters gets more scenes but there is no character development .. overall it was a feast for the eyes with a few surprise and descent battles","true":true}
