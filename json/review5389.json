Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite all the \\\"spoiler\\\" talk on everything from reddit to the actual promotional commercials\/interviews\\, nothing in this film really flips the franchise on its head. It's a story that simply goes from point A to point B; established ideas are barely explored and character development is abandoned. Underwhelming is the feeling. On a scale from A to F\\, I give this an OK.","true":true}
