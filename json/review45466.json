Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed\\, I gave it another shot on Blue Ray\\, it's just as bad\\, this time even worse because of the negative feelings I already had for this movie.  Tried to like it but couldn't\\, there's no way I'm watching Solo\\, a pathetic script it's like they re wrote the freaking original with a different spin\\, but this time it sucks!  Killing off one fo the most iconic character in Star Wars franchise.  Idiots!","true":true}
