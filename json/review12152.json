Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan like many of the folks on here.  I'm not going to argue with anyone who likes the movie\\, but I'm not one of them.  Does it have its moments?  Absolutely!  Some of the humor is just too silly.  The Casino planet was a waste of 15 minutes.  I've seen the movie twice.  During the second showing\\, I went to the bathroom during that scene.  The movie is actually enjoyable without it!  I want to talk about other things\\, but they would be considered spoilers.  All I have to say is this:  how did these new force powers show up?  That's just silly for us to accept from a \\\"religion\\\" that's been around for thousands of years (and a bunch of movies and cartoons)... and NOW they're able to pull off some stunts never before seen?  I don't think so.  The acting in this movie is pretty top notch.  The only character I still can not stand is Finn.  And\\, to tell you the truth\\, his character is pretty much wasted in this movie all the way around.  In the end\\, the movie DID have its moments.  I've seen it twice now.  But where it fails\\, it drops the overall experience extremely low.  Almost makes me want to watch The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones to lift me up again!","true":true}
