Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a shame. Safe to say Disney missed the irony in turning a film designed exclusively to sell toys into a poor impression of an anti-capitalist rant. Plot holes abound and character development is nonexistent. Were it not for four decades of nostalgia this movie would have died on a cutting room floor.","true":true}
