Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Coming back to this after watching the next movie in the franchise\\, and I still don't understand why people hate it so much. It's incredibly daring for a Star Wars movie\\, focuses hard on the character's development instead of fetishizing lightsabers\\, droids and other things that can be made into merchandise\\, has striking visuals and wonderfully choreographed fight scenes. It also asks questions about gray morality and responsibility in a way that no other movie from the franchise had before. It's a shame that it was retconned later on\\, and Rian Johnson forever has my respect.","true":true}
