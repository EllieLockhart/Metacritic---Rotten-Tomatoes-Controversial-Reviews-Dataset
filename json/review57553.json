Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the very worst movies I have ever seen\\, not just Star Wars move but movies in general. What a travesty it was the way they handled Luke's character. Truly heartbreaking. This was not Luke Skywalker\\, rather some random old man played by Mark Hamil. I can;t even imagine how much money Disney paid the critics to give it good reviews. Has anyone read the critics reviews? They consist of 1 -2 sentence \\\"reviews\\\" stating generally how great the movie was. Really just terrible. The plot was atrocious and for a two and a half hour movie was incredibly poor at setting up plot points.\\n\\nBasically\\, The Last Jedi decided that everything TFA set up. Who is Snoke? Who cares\\, he was cut in half LOL. Who's Rey's parents\\, NO ONE! But lets move one to some random Asian chick we are supposed to develop some type of feelings. They spent more time on her than Luke\/Snoke\/Rey combined. Luke is one of the greatest characters in cinematic history and they could not have done him more of a disservice.\\n\\nAs far as I am concerned this film is not canon\\, people have been put in jail for lesser offenses than the making of this film. What a disgraceful excuse for a Star Wars movie. Star Wars is dead\\, I will not even watch a preview for episode 9.\\n\\n-100\/10. A travesty.","true":true}
