Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage.  I'm so disappointed.  The prequel are more fulfilling than this piece of crap.  Luke saved his father but tried to murder his nephew.  Luke can force Skype across the galaxy but he lets Snoke's first order destroy the New Republic in Force Awakens.  Luke milks a dinosaurs and tosses Anakin's lightsaber over his shoulder in the first scene.  Luke dies without training Rey.\\n\\nI hope a lot of people at Disney get fired for this debacle.","true":true}
