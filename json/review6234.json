Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has ruined the Star Wars franchise in an effort to cut ties with George Lucas and the former Star Wars characters. This is a politically correct corporate designed please everyone film with a feminist slant that seems to negatively portray all male characters\\, and suffers from a complete misunderstanding of the moral compass and character of Luke Skywalker and the force. The moral authority that drove the philosophy of the force that so many fans identified with is completely gone. Oh\\, and let us not forget the Mary Poppins portrayal of Princess Leia. This film evoked no emotion in me as I watched\\, other than knowing the themes and hope I grew up on were over in this franchise. Usually when the professional critics give something a thumbs up\\, the audience gives a thumbs down. \\nThat trend holds true here. I expect the word of mouth to get around and for the revenue to drop considerably in the coming weekends.","true":true}
