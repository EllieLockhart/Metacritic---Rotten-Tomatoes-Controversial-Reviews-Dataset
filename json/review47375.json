Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This film may have finally killed StarWars for me. TFA lifted my spirits and gave me actual hope. Yes\\, it reused a lot of things from ANH\\, but we needed to reset after the prequels and so I was accepting of it. But this film... it undid all of the hard work that went into TFA and put this trilogy into the negative. This isn't even a trilogy anymore. This was supposed to be a middle film in a TRILOGY\\, a continuing story - NOT a stand-alone that can kill off every thread that TFA established and replace it with NOTHING for the upcoming and final installment. I have no interest in what happens next. I liked the possibilities that TFA set up\\, there were so many roads that we could have gone down. But now we just have nothing (and porg merchandise). I'll never understand it and it's just tragic to watch this trilogy get set on fire. I was sad that Han died in TFA\\, but at least Harrison Ford got out before this happened. I feel so bad for Mark Hamill. As he said\\, the Luke in TLJ is *not* his Luke. It's not mine either. RIP StarWars.","true":true}
