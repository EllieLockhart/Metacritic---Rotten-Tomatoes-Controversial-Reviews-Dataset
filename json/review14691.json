Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never felt emotion like I did in this movie. The bad: Canto Bight. This world does not belong in Star Wars. Nuff said. The good: Everything else. Amazing. No spoiler\\, but the scene with the millennium falcon flying through the core of Crait was Star Wars gold. I keep playing that scene in my head with the music. Literally unforgettable. You must experience this.","true":true}
