Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just wasted too many opportunities to be good. Of all 8 SW films\\, this one probably comes in at #7\\, maybe 6. No higher. I'm ok if the writer has different ideas\\, but you can't just throw out the entire ethos of a franchise like Star Wars and start all over.","true":true}
