Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was just bad and the director was so immature when it came to taking criticism from the fans\\, the movie was horrid but it looks good it's like the fake food in commercials\\, it looks good but it'd probably kill you","true":true}
