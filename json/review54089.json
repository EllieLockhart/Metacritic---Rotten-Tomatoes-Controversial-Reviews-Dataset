Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't do reviews\\, but I thought I should since the critics score is so high and doesn't reflect at all what the audience seems to agree on\\, which is that this was a fun space adventure movie but completely destroyed all the work Star Wars had put into its world. It felt like when we found out that neo in the matrix was just another thing the machines used to keep the matrix going. The Jedi are the reason I watched Star Wars. The idea that they could one day win is why we watch. This movie however basically tells us that this is wrong. The resistance is tiny\\, in a giant galaxy there are only a few hundred of them. The Jedis don't exist. There are only 2 and Luke is a pathetic version of his younger self. There isn't anything exciting about watching the resistance get picked off one by one. It felt more like a genocide than a battle. The evil snoke isn't even bad enough to survive until the third instalment in the trilogy. Everything seems pretty much resolved at the end of this movie\\, is there even a purpose to a third?","true":true}
