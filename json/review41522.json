Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is brilliant. Don\u2019t be influenced by the haters. The themes are clear and consistent and everything that happens\\, happens for a reason. It took me two viewings to understand fully\\, but Rian Johnson has crafted a masterpiece. This is a movie about living in the moment and learning from your past failures to become what you are meant to be. Can\u2019t wait to see what comes next!","true":true}
