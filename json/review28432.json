Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"pretentious\\, over-the-top movie with bad\\, if even any\\, pacing. instead of using its longest time wisely to delve deeper into the characters we came to love in TFA\\, develop the already established plot points and questions\\, and treat the original characters well this turns into a completely incoherent mess that seems to have nothing in common story-wise with its predecessor than a few character names. for a person who's not a star wars fan it's mind-boggling what the film tries to accomplish and it could've ended an hour earlier\\, if there's any special 'nerd nods' those fly over my head since I'm not that invested. in my eyes it's just a very unsatisfying film with little structure that tries too much with the wrong stuff.  biggest indication of its problems for me was that during and after the showing I felt NOTHING. if there were climaxes I had no time to process them or the stakes for the characters... was I supposed to feel emotional? sad? happy? angry? because I felt empty\\, there was no way to connect to any storyline when the movie was full of jump cuts. \\n\\nrey didn't really get her own part in this movie - instead of showing more sides to her\\, they made \\\"her power and jedi title\\\" define who she was... it actually thwarted what TFA had worked to establish and completely ridiculed TLJ's own message of 'her coming from nothing' - instead of being important by family she's just important because of a handed ability\\, Lucasfilm stepped on their own foot. Everyone else was unrecognisable or just badly written - luke skywalker was weak\\, poe was annoying\\, finn and rose were irrelevant\/forced\\, snoke became laughable\\, leia was robbed a beautiful death scene (and purpose)\\, kylo ren stopped being relatable and felt more fanfiction-esque than anything. honestly no character 'development' or dynamic felt authentic\\, which saddens me and might have contributed to the emptiness it left me feeling.\\n\\nbesides its plot holes\\, unfocus and much more it doesn't even know what tone it wants to set. the last jedi\\, or rian johnson\\, wants you to take it seriously but the movie itself doesn't with its overload of untimely jokes. if I wouldn't have seen any SW before\\, this would appear to me as a random action flick - no less no more. it didn't fulfill its role as a SEQUEL which bothered me immensely; 2\\,5h that could've gone into this new trilogy to really broaden and make the story complex but tidied was wasted on... visual depth? fight scenes? \\\"risk-taking\\\"? at what cost I ask... because it doesn't leave me wanting to see the next installment.","true":true}
