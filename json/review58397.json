Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After so much speculation from 2 years of waiting I will say I was thoroughly disappointed! Being a long fan of star wars I officially hate Disney and what they have done to this great franchise. They had too many \\\"funny\\\" one liners\\, too many \\\"cute creatures\\\" too much  of what Disney does for any movie. Who is snoke you ask? Well no clue it didn't explain. Who is Rey you ask? No clue! I want to see more of the great Luke Skywalker you say\\, well let me spoil it for you\\, he is a pathetic cry baby who acts like a whiny teenage boy. This star wars movie was an absolute disappointment and I am not looking forward to any other star wars movie any time soon.","true":true}
