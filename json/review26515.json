Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Official Disney Branded film; failed pointless humor that undercut any  emotional weight\\, pointless side stories and new characters\\, undermines all the previous movies by dismissing everything they set up to make way for a comfortable\\, safe market for Disney; children's movies and merchandising. Let's hope Disney keeps a more \\\"adult\\\" universe in the side movies like Rogue One.","true":true}
