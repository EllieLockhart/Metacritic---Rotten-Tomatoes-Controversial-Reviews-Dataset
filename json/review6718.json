Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't know where all these positive reviews are coming from... I can judge a movie by its ability to keep me engaged..  interested...excited and most importantly ..awake \\n1st half of this movie... most boring\\nsecond half.. not really up to expectations either. I fell asleep for couple of mins during the film... So did my friends.. for those people who have written it is the best star wars they have ever seen... I have one comment for you... up yours... I'm sorry for the language but seriously.. get a life and stop liking something just because your a fan even if it is rubbish...","true":true}
