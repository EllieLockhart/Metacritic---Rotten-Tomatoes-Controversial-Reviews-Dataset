Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually spectacular\\, the film\\, at first\\, left me with mixed emotions. After seeing it a second time\\, I found I liked it quite a lot. It's a transitional segment of a trilogy\\, much like The Empire Strikes Back was for the original trilogy. It makes me eager to see what Episode IX will do.","true":true}
