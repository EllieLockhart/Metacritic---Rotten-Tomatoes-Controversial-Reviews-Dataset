Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great concept with unexpected turns that for the most part satisfy the viewers but some unnecessary\\, out of place and stupid moments hold the film for surpassing its predecessor. It\u2019s mixed positive and negative components relate it to the best prequel movie\\, \u2018Revenge of the Sith\u2019. A great build up from The Force Awakens was mostly squandered from Luke\u2019s first action to several revelations that simply make fun of and insult fans. ","true":true}
