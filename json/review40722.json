Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This makes The Phantom Menace look like an Academy Award winning film. So disappointed in the storyline and characters. Spoiler Alert: Anyone can be Rey or Snoke. And it doesn't matter why she is so strong with the Force or who Snoke is. And a thousand generation of Jedi? Let's destroy it with one lightning bolt. The reason everyone loves Game of Thrones is because its history is rich with details and the characters just didn't pop out of nowhere. There are families\\, there's lineage\\, there's secrets\\, just like in real life. Star Wars used to be like this but Disney (Kathleen Kennedy) threw this out the window. Now\\, everything is so predictable\\, especially Episode 9. Disney just totally destroyed the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
