Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was soooo disappointed. I've never left a Star Wars movie feeling so let down\\, not even Attack of the Clones..... while tastes differ from person to person\\,\\, out of the 2 1\/2 hrs of this movie I found only about 1\/2 hr worthy.","true":true}
