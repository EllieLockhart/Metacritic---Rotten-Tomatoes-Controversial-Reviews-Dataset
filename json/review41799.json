Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is scorched earth to the franchise - which\\, based on the title\\, was maybe always the plan.  Watching the live action character rape of Luke Skywalker\\, made me actually want to unwatch this film - which is entirely new.  I've never disliked a film so much I'd rather never have seen it.  So that's new.","true":true}
