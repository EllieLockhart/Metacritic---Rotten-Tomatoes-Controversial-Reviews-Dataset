But I'm not just saying that nothing was entertainmentI love the del Toro fiasco and the visuals were on point. Plus the jokes editing \\,pretty cherry tomatoes fresh. I imagine it's gonna be fun to watch when I'm an eledery folk late at night.\\n I know I'm gonna see an article about the film again soon .
