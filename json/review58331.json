Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actually didn't mind this in the theatre and think that Daisy Ridley is awesome as the lead character that this story unfolds around.  I think my true feel for it was when I bought the DVD.  Every other Star Wars couldn't wait to see and went right into the player when it crossed into my house.  This one sat unopened for two weeks.\\nUpon watching it again: Cripes.  No explanations\\, no character development\\, kill off Snoke and reveal nothing about him.  That whole stupid side trip to the gambling planet\\, no explanation why Rey has tota force power with zero training\\, stupid slapstick poorly placed.  I could go on and on.  If fanboys have tanked this because they are threatened by new ideas\\, then grow up.  My poor rating is because on watching it again I really don't care about the storylines or where they are going - and the whole Leia force surf through space\\, give me a break.","true":true}
