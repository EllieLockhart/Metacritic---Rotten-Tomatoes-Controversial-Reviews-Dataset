Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie absolutely does not \\\"honor the saga's rich legacy\\\"\\nLook at Rey? How long did it take Luke to even get decent at using the force? This Mary Sue just picks up a lightsaber of a REAL jedi and is immediately an adept at force arts? Please... There is very little real struggle in the new movies. No one works for anything. Kill off all the main characters? okay....This is a disgrace to the memory of the original trilogy. This is a disgrace to the fans\\, this is a disgrace to the force. Thanks for ruining one of the only fond memories of my abusive childhood I had left. Rose Tico is the best character in this movie by FAR.","true":true}
