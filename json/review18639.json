Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I too\\, created this account just to share this review - first movie review I've ever written.\\n     I expect viewers' reactions to this movie will be divided based on how much the viewers know of all the prior Star Wars lore\/stories.  If they don't know much (no offense intended)\\, I suspect they'll love this movie with all its action and surprise twists.  But if they're very knowledgeable about all the prior lore and stories detailing the original characters (Han\/Leia\/Luke) personalities\\, Jedi history\\, and how the Force works and doesn't work\\, then they may have trouble getting past how that is portrayed in this movie and it may prevent them from enjoying the movie.\\n     The rest of this review is mainly aimed at die hard fans who may be wondering if other die hard fans perceived the movie as they did.\\n     I want to share a little personal history with Star Wars\\, to help make my final point in this review.  I've been obsessed with Star Wars since I was a little kid and my dad took me to see the original Star Wars in the movie theatre.  I loved all 6 live action movies George Lucas made - even the prequel movies (Episodes 1-3) that many people bashed\\, I thought were fantastic.  I loved the \\\"Clone Wars\\\" movie and following \\\"Clone Wars\\\" TV show.  I know almost all of the Expanded Universe stories and lore and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I still have all my childhood Star Wars toys.  I have all the movies\/shows on DVD\/Blueray.  I've read 95% of the Star Wars novels and a good chunk of the comics.  My home office is totally decorated in Star Wars everything.  I have all the movie posters framed on the wall.  I collect character statues (like Kotobukiya & Gentle Giant).  I've dressed up as a Jedi for Halloween both as a kid and an adult.  I've played most of the Star Wars video games over the years and still daily play the Star Wars The Old Republic MMO computer game.  I meet at the local comic book store every week to play the Star Wars X-Wing board game.  I've been very happy with everything Star Wars over the years and I've always thought George Lucas did a fantastic job.  And it's always really bothered me when I heard other people bash George Lucas and\/or his work.  I am a life long\\, huge Star Wars fan and all my family\\, friends\\, and even coworkers know Star Wars is my thing.\\n     However\\, since Disney took over\\, I've gradually started to become a little worried.  At first I was a surprised and disappointed that Disney decided to kill the Expanded Universe (said only Episodes 1-6 movies and Clone Wars movie and Clone Wars TV series are cannon now - all other stories are \\\"Legends\\\").  But I also understood Disney's argument that they needed a fresh start to do their own thing and I quickly made peace with that and was just happy we would keep getting more new Star Wars stories.  First\\, Disney released the Stars Wars \\\"Rebels\\\" TV series which was just ok and has gotten better\\, but has still never come close matching Lucas's\/Filloni's original Star Wars \\\"Clone Wars\\\" TV series\\, which Disney immediately cancelled without giving proper closure.  Their Star Wars \\\"Destinies\\\" cartoon was a neat idea for very female fans\\, but their implementation of it was outright embarrassing.  \\\"Rogue One\\\" was ok\\, but just didn't feel right or feel like Star Wars to me for some reason (although I do give credit for a great Darth Vader end scene).  With the \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" I liked Rey and Poe\\, but was so disappointed in how they gave us back a broken down Han Solo and then immediately killed him off\\, and then I was very worried about their intentions with sending Luke Skywalker into exile......and since then I've worried about Luke Skywalker's new story for the last 2 years\\, hoping that Episode 8 would alleviate my fears.\\n     So enough with the setup\/history\\, I'll get on with my review of the new movie.\\n     I finally got to see \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" yesterday.  I'll try to keep the details vague to avoid spoilers.  The opening battle scene was fun (especially as an X-Wing board game fan).  From ROTJ and the EU stories\\, I agree\/understand that Leia Organa is a Skywalker and is Force sensitive\\, but I thought their handling of that scene was weird and awkward.  There are a couple unexpected twists in the middle\\, that were potentially very cool\/interesting right at first\\, but then later I never understand what they accomplished other than initial shock value and making one of the new major characters totally pointless.  Finn and Rose's mission didn't even seem feasible at first\\, and then later I perceived it as completely pointless filler.  By the end of the movie we did finally get the complete picture of Luke Skywalker's new story.  And this new story was a total character assassination of Luke Skywalker - and they totally destroyed him.  Now I get why Mark Hamill said Luke's story wasn't what he expected and why I go the impression from his interviews that he was politely trying to hint that he was not happy about it and not responsible for it\\, without actually outright saying it (and potentially getting himself into trouble with Kathleen Kennedy or Disney).  I was disappointed in how they broke Han Solo\\, but I am EXTREMELY ANGRY about how they completely destroyed Luke Skywalker.  I'm being completely serious when I say I hope George Lucas never watches this movie\\, because I worry that seeing how they destroyed one of his most iconic characters might literally kill him (heart attack\/stroke).  I walked out the theatre yesterday thinking I might be done with Star Wars - I'm thinking about selling all my Star Wars stuff on ebay\\, not seeing any more Star Wars movies\\, not going to the new Disney Star Wars theme park.  Previously\\, I've been a life long Star Wars fan and very happy with ALL of the Star Wars stories and lore\\, even when a lot of other fans were not (that was the point I was attempting to make by sharing my personal history with Star Wars at first - I apologize if that was annoying to read).  Maybe I'll eventually find a way to make peace with this and still be a Star Wars fan\\, but right now I just can't see that happening. If it does happen\\, I don't see how Star Wars will ever be as special to me as it was before.  I'm feeling very depressed and a bit lost since most of my entertainment and even my identity was wrapped up in Star Wars.  Who knows\\, maybe losing that will turn out to be a good\/healthy thing\\, but it doesn't feel like it right now.  Writing this review might be good therapy.","true":true}
