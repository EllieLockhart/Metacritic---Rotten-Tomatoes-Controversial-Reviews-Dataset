Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad Writing\\, riddled with plot holes\\, dropped subplots from the force awakens.  Took characters in directions that made no sense with other continuity in star wars cannon.  Very busy movie with too many plot lines that tied together very poorly.  Special effects were astounding and actors gave the best performances they could with the script as bad as it was.  Two thumbs up to the special effects team and the acting staff.  Lost opportunity overall.  Shame.","true":true}
