Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adjusting my score since rotten tomatoes doesn't count 1\/2 star ratings.\\n\\nI would go into all the faults of The Last Jedi\\, but there are so many and other reviewers have already covered them.  Interestingly\\, the best response the apologists can muster in defense of this movie is \\\"Get over yourselves\\\" or \\\"Silly\\, intolerant fanboys\\\" instead of addressing the movie's glaring flaws.\\n\\nAnd no\\, this isn't a fake review.  If you want to read fake reviews\\, then look no further than the Critics' reviews.  91% is about as fake as you can get for this nonsense.\\n\\nBTW\\, The Last Jedi doesn't show women in a strong light.  Quite the opposite.  It portrays them as incompetent nincompoops.  But then again\\, everyone looks like an idiot in this movie so that isn't really saying much.","true":true}
