Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the best testament to how bad this movie is\\, is that when youtubers critically review this movie with all the things wrong with it\\, that the youtube video ends up being LONGER than the MOVIE!!! The biggest fault for this movie is there is no place to go. Who cares about Kylo Ren... he has been beaten multiple times by Rey. Rey has proven unbeatable in all things. She beat Luke after practicing swinging on a rock for 5 minutes. What else matters?  This movie took my excitement for Star Wars from a 8 or 9 and pushed it to a 1 or 2. I doubt I will even go see the next in theaters and just wait for it to go digital.","true":true}
