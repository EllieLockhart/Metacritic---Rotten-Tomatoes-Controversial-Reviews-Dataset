Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well I have to say this is not a very good Star Wars movie. I want to like it but I just cannot\\, to put it simply the story progression is boring and I can describe in one scene at when the resistance leadership is gone the way they developed that scene to progress was boring\\, unconvincing and really felt out of place at the time and unfortunetely there were quite a few plot holes like this throught the movie. It really feels like there is nothing left to follow up on anymore because you are not left with owe and excitement at the end of this movie. Sadly its more convenient for them to put all the blame on russian bots for all the negativity this movie has received. Hate to break it but the reality is much harsher then some russian bots.","true":true}
