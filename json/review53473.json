Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t believe the critics! Clearly Disney is paying for positive reviews! This movie is so inconsistent\\, dull\\, and boring. The characters go against their own narratives and nothing they do makes any sense. You\u2019ll hear from critics that it\u2019s bold and the final act is fantastic! They are completely full of themselves! Spoilers ahead : We see Leia get blasted out of her ship into space\\, and manages to use the force to pull herself back in. Seriously the silliest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in any Star Wars film. Luke is some washed up loser because of some past deed\\, and won\u2019t go help his sister and the rebellion because he\u2019s lost faith. We know from his character that he would always want to go help his friends. It\u2019s literally what happens in the original films countless times - he even leaves yoda while training to go save them. Finn\u2019s storyline is just terrible \\, just boring \\, pointless\\, and terrible. Shame on the story writers. Was so pumped to see leader snoke\\, and he literally dies in a comical way. Oh and same thing with Finns trainer\\, she just dies\\, and we\u2019re supposed to be like yah!! Rey is somehow stronger than all Jedi and Siths after 1 day of training. Because yes\\, the storyline for this film apparently takes place within 1 day?? Somehow a whole fleet of first order ships can\u2019t catch up to one rebellion cruiser\\, can\u2019t destroy it with their weapons\\, and have to wait for it to run out of fuel? This is the best plot line they could come up with??? Seriously? And then Luke just dies on the island at the end. Did he need to die? Was it necessary? Or is Disney just trying to push along all these crappy new characters. Once more we\u2019ll see another genre once loved turn into Disney goo. This is why films are dying! ","true":true}
