Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is great fun.  Mark Hamil does a fantastic job of playing a \\\"grumpy old Luke Skywalker\\\"\\, and Daisy Ridley again plays a great Rey opposite Luke and Ben\/Kylo Ren.  Meanwhile\\, there's a very entertaining (and occasionally heartwarming) dirty dozen plotline with Finn (Boyega)\\, Rose (newcomer Kelly Marie Tran)\\, and Poe (Isaac).\\n\\nThe best thing about the movie?  It coheres well\\, but it has -so- many fake-outs and plot twists that it's very nicely unpredictable.","true":true}
