Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"-Spoiler-\\n\\n I really loved the film. The dynamic between Ben Solo and Rey is fantastic. I am also very excited for the next episode and the romantic tension between Rey and Ben. Rose was fantastic too\\, Finn and Poe also did a very good job. I don\u00b4t actually know why so many people hate the movie. They hated TFA because it was like a new hope but they also hate this movie because its too different. They also say Finn\u00b4s an Rose\u00b4s misson was useless\\, but what did you expect? Not everything is going to end well for the \\\"good\\\" guys. Thats normal. Not every mission can be succesful\\, that\u00b4s what Rian showed us\\, the gloom of war\\, and he did it perfectly!","true":true}
