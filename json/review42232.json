Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie's similar to The Empire Strikes Back in the sense that it goes in directions you don't expect and keeps you on razor's edge the entire time. The first one played it safe to reel you in\\, then this one doesn't hold back in terms of playing with your expectations and giving you an incredible experience throughout most of the movie. There were multiple points in this movie where I wanted to applaud it right then and there. There's nothing quite like watching this movie for the first time with almost no knowledge about it\\, even if it isn't quite as good upon later viewings. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because of a few issues I can't address in this spoiler-free review.","true":true}
