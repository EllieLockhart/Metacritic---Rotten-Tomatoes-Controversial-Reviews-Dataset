Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I expect the audience reaction to be worse than the cridicts reaction\\, but after more reviews from less die hard fans cone in\\, it'll be go up. The fact is\\, Rian Johnson made some very STRONG choices\\, very bold choices\\, and didn't just play the Feasterville hits like The Force Awakens did. I think some of the people reacting poorly to it feel stupid because none of their theories were anywhere close to true. Star Wars needed to move forward. It haven't done that since Return of the Jedi\\, truly. It has now. Great films take risks and tear some things down. I thought the movie was breathtaking and appropriate. Emotionally satisfying. it is really saying something when a movie\\, especially one that is so picked apart like Star Wars\\, to be truly surprising. Johnson deserves a lot of credit for that","true":true}
