Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am amazed by the amount of hate this film received. I thought the action was great\\, the story was great (aside from the Casino planet scenes)\\, and I feel this sets up an exciting and intriguing future for upcoming Star Wars movies.","true":true}
