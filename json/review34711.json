Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics think its a good movie and it would be if it wasn't a Star Wars movie.  It's so desperately wants to be something new that it forgets everything that came before it.  Gone our your heroes of only one movie ago\\, they are now all failed old farts who failed to learn from there past.  Every character carried over is a failure in this directors eye.\\n\\nDave Filoni should be overseeing all Star Wars movies and have final say like Kevin Feige at Marvel.  Give it to someone who actually knows Star Wars history and has respect for the characters.\\n\\nStar Wars would have been better served with Rian Johnson telling his own story set within the Star Wars universe then him ruining The Saga.","true":true}
