Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the hell was that!!!!  So freaking disappointing!!! Unbelievable that any Star Wars fan would have anything good to say about this movie it is a disgrace to the other films.   I didn't totally like the prequels but that had the feel of Star Wars.  This movie did not have the magic that comes with Star Wars.  It was dull and had forced humor.  There is absolutely none of the feeling that takes you out of the real world into your inner child or reaches into your imagination.    It is a chaotic mess with no depth\\, bad acting and NO STORY!!!  There is always an amazing story at least!!  Give us back JJ Abrams or at least George Lucas!!  R\u00edan Johnson gets three more of these??  He's a joke and I will not be going to see them.  Star Wars either ends for me with the episode 9 or Force awakens!","true":true}
