Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics must have been bribed! This film is a joke from start to finish! I had high hopes for this movie but was massively disappointed! The \\\"jokes\\\" were cringe worthy and the story is all over the place. It's a complete departure from what made Star Wars so popular! The film is summed up well by the ridiculous Leia flying through space scene! Luke Skywalker deserved more! The all powerful Snoke dies a pathetic death! The Rose Tico character seems pointless and uninteresting! So upset with how they've killed the story!","true":true}
