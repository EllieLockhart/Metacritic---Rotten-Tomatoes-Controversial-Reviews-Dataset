Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a movie that wanted please every audience and be enjoyable at different levels\\, with the many sub plots and more complex themes rather than just light and dark. It completely renewed the franchise\\, introducing many character and literally\\, at some points\\, ditching old themes\\, items or plot elements\\, opting for a more complex approach. It has beautiful CGI\\, with really well made action scenes and plot twists that I just didn't expect. It had subplots that at times felt annoying\\, but that pulled me out of the \\\"classic action\\\" into new story lines with different development. It's too self-aware by criticizing heroes\\, its own Jedi religion and hinting at a new approach to the force\\, and some fans may not be pleased by it\\, but generally I like the direction that it's taking for future movies\\, because they may either go with the usual construction or opt for something new\\, whatever the choice\\, this movie is something fresh that retains the essence.","true":true}
