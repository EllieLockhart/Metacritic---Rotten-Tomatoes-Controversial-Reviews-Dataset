Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately just a truly dreadful Star Wars film\\, and film full stop. Everything else aside\\, doesn't even do the basic thing that any film (let alone a Star Wars film) has to do: entertain. This is a snooze fest from start to finish. And trust me that is merely the tip of an enormous iceberg with this dud.","true":true}
