Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most excellent. I think the fact that you could use the old characters to develop the new and really show the passing of the torch was the true triumph. Long live Rey!!!","true":true}
