Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After viewing this movie I have no further interest in the story of Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Kylo. I don\u2019t care what happens to those posers and the continuation of their story. This is without a doubt a cash grab to push out the old OT characters and push on us\\, these uninspired new wanna-bees. The plot was laughable\\, the treatment of the OT heroes was despicable\\, and it just didn\u2019t feel like a Star Wars movie. I never felt so disappointed after watching a starwars movie.
