Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the original trilogy.  Three of the best movies ever.  I hated the prequels.  Disappointed in Force Awakens\\, but could tolerate the many flaws for the promise of upcoming Last Jedi.  Liked Rogue One. \\n I was extremely disappointed in the Last Jedi.  Thought it was one of the worst.  Story was poor\\, acting bad\\, little character explanation development.  Just Not good at all\\, and had such high hopes. The scene of Luke milking the space cow just put me over the top in dislike","true":true}
