Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie did lighten up the whole Rey-not-having-flaws problem in the Force Awakens\\, but I didn't find interest in the humor and found that the plot still had problems making sense. Rose and Finn were enjoyable characters\\, but the villain wasn't too strong and there wasn't too much character development. There were too many focuses and it was difficult to keep up with; it wasn't the worst movie\\, but I don't understand how it could have gotten a 91% critic rating.","true":true}
