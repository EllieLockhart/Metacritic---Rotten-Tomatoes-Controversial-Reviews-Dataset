Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie has so many issues it is actually heart braking. Iconic characters are mistreated\\, destroyed and simply poorly writen. Instead of established characters completly new cast is promoted forcebly and poorly. In the end resault instead of reciving characters we grown to love and anticipete we recived some bubling unlikeable idiots. Plot dosen't make sense. It is to convoluted\\, out of Focus on the right topic. With infamous Canto Baight subplot that is a dead end. Movie tries hard (and fails) to push feminist agenda by \\\"showing us STRONG female characters\\\" which it fails spectacularly. Admiral Holdo is THE WORST female character I have ever seen. Instead of promoting female characters it undermines them by puting on the pedestal this horendous and insulting women portrail of \\\"STRONG WOMAN CHARACTER\\\" It is simply sad. I hate this movie. Has nice visualas at Times\\, though.","true":true}
