Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete let down. Horrible script writing that tried so hard to get a laugh out of the audience from start to finish that never worked. Added a new character that did absolutely nothing for the film but make you want to go to the next scene. A plot that really serves no purpose and leaves you feeling...nothing. I commend movie makers for trying to step out of the box and create new ideas and push boundaries but it has to all mesh together and work for the audience to feel like the risks were worth it. It's a fantasy so pushing boundaries is okay but in this case it was an explosion of ideas that floated around and then tied to nothing in the story. Overall\\, it was the lack of any sort of feelings i had when the film was over that let me down. The two and half hours of film did nothing to awaken any feelings in me.","true":true}
