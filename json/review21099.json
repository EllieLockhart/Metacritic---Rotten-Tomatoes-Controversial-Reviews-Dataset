Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited for this movie and I left the theater so disappointed.  It had a little bit of everything (not in a good way) that I cannot pinpoint what I disliked so much about it.\\n\\nI didn't find it funny in the parts that I was supposed to\\, yet I almost laughed out loud at the Leia flying scene.  I wanted to know who Snoke was and where Rey came from...nope.  I would have liked to have seen more Phasma but she got about 1 minute screen time and died.  And what they did to Luke was a disgrace.  I read that Mark Hamill was not happy with his character in this movie and I can't fault him there.\\n\\nI was really disappointed in the direction (or lack thereof) they took the newer characters.  I felt that Finn and Poe were misused in this movie.  Instead\\, 2 new characters took prime screen time.  I was indifferent to Admiral Holdo herself and found it impractical that she wouldn't share her master plan with Poe.  I found the other new character\\, Rose to be useless.  Even worse than that\\, I found her to be more annyoing than Jar Jar Binks (yes\\, really).\\n\\nI don't know what JJ Abrams can do if anything to right this sinking ship.  But\\, please JJ\\, save us...you're our only hope!","true":true}
