Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I just loved Last of Us (2013 ). What a great story. What amazing characters. Joel and Ellie and their growing relationship\\, their bond\\,  with each other - that was great to watch ( and play). This was the heart and soul of what made that game so great. But\\, as much as it hurts to say\\, Last of Us Part 2 took a giant DUMP all over that and destroyed all the heart and soul there ever was.I just loved Last of Us (2013 ). What a great story.

But\\, as much as it hurts to say\\, Last of Us Part 2 took a giant DUMP all over that and destroyed all the heart and soul there ever was. Now don't get me wrong\\, LOUP2 is still such a beautiful game and has its intense moments\\, but the story is just horrible and betrays everything about its characters from the previous game. It slaps every fan hard across their face and forces them to play psychotic murderers with split personality issues and also FORCES the player to be confronted with the \\\"woke community\\\".  Last of Us Part 2 is a game full of plot holes and  a giant amount of flashbacks that rip you out of the game so often\\, it annoys the teets off a rat. These time jumps just ruin the whole immersion that a player wants to keep in a game. Two\\, maybe three well-placed ones I might be okay with\\, but this is just a bad way to tell a story. I was soooo looking forward to this game\\, but after playing it for a few hours I was regretting it bitterly. And I took my sweet sweet time to with my playthrough ( over 36 hours) because I spent 70 fricking bucks and wanted to squeeze out every cent possible in return. And boy\\, I can tell you that wasn't easy.  You know\\, There is a farm seen later in the game ( I won't describe more) in which my only thought was \\\"oh God\\, please let this be finally over\\\".  That alone explains what a painful journey this game is. The only good thing to say about it is. that it is truly a beautiful game with lots of areas to scrounge through and awesome detailed regions where you just want to stop and just LOOK around. There are some \\\"levels\\\" in which you can choose to sneak around certain enemies instead of hunting them all down like a serial killer. But then: in other areas you don't have that option. For me the \\\"Game Killer was the way a certain well-known (and loved) main character was \\\"ended\\\". This person DESERVED a better way to go. Also\\, the missing option to be able to knock someone out - that has to be an effing JOKE. How can you NOT have the choice to knock someone out instead of having to kill them? That is so NOT right. This game has turned its main characters into psychopaths and ignores everything the characters have learned and experienced in their past. It contradicts the true soul of its characters and pees all over the logic of certain choices \/ decisions they make. And that's why judgement is:  they effed it all up!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
