Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director ruined this movie that had so much potential by completely disregarding major plots and destroying many of our favorite characters with terrible send offs and killing potential future characters in ways just as awful.","true":true}
