Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was better than I expected and I\u2019ve been there since the beginning. This is as good or better than Empire and considering that was my favorite it says a lot. Don\u2019t let the bad reviews intimidate you\\, they are from supposed Star Wars fans who are upset because they spent a bundle on EU and none of it comes out in the movies. It\u2019s good\\, it\u2019s a complete story and leaves no questions. May The Force Be With You!! ","true":true}
