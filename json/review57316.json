Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is horrible. Star Wars Fan or not\\, it's just a Poorly made movie in general. The writing is terrible\\, so many inconsistencies and plot holes that this movie falls apart the more you think about it. Sure it's well shot\\, and Mark Hamil does his best as Luke Skywalker but the story is terrible and the way classic characters are portrayed is disgusting. \\n\\nSpeaking of the plot holes and inconsistencies\\, If you're even looking for a sequel to Force Awakens I'm sorry to tell you that this doesn't line up at all. It doesn't line up with the rest of the Movies either\\, but it's most apprent to the movie that it's SUPPOSED to be a direct sequel too. \\n\\nThey sacrifice story for surprise over and over\\, Setting things up like the old Star Wars and then Throwing a Twist in that really destroys the story over and over. The whole whole movie is a Dissapointing and really wasted potential. \\n\\nThe forced Diversity and Women in Star Wars is really starting to show\\, Where all the new characters are females and they are written terrible all the same. I was looking forward to a Movie like the original Star Wars that was a well made movie\\, but had awesome Characters. Luke had such an amazing Journey in the original trilogy\\, but in this movie his character is Written sooooo bad that It's embarrassing to one of the greatest characters of all time. The new Main Charavter Rey\\, Is Also terribly written. She's just right all the time\\, and is the solution to every problem. If Disney wanted strong Female Charaters\\, they have failed by making them carboard cutouts of Perfect human beings.\\n\\nI'd write more\\, but That's as a Critic not as a Star Wars movie. That's a waaaay longer review anyways. Worst movie in the Star Wars Franchise in my book. Yeah\\, Worse then Jar Jar.","true":true}
