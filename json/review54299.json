Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for this movie and now I feel completely betrayed as a life long fan. Rian Johnson made a mess in Episode 8. Imagine Episode 7 was all about finding the legendary Luke Skywalker which fans waited 34 years to see\\, only to treat him like a disposable\\, pathetic after thought?  Snoke\\, a powerful and mysterious figure cloaked in the force\\, only to have him so easily dispersed? So much wasted potential and conflict because of lazy writing\\, horrible character development and awkward comedy. So disappointed.  Either Rian Johnson hated the original trilogy\\, Luke specifically or he couldn't wait to transform Starwars into Disney on ICE (i.e. princesses floating in space).  Waste of time and money","true":true}
