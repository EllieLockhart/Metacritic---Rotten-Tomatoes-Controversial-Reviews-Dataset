Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best of the Disney era Star Wars films. The story will come as entirely unexpected\\, and that's a good thing given the way the surprises pan out. The run time is hefty\\, but I found myself wishing for more at the end.","true":true}
