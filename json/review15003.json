Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I kind of miss when characters recognized they were flawed and realised they need their companions to win. That's what made Luke Skywalker so great\\, and Rey not as great. Don't get me wrong\\, Rey is a great character\\, but she's no Luke. \\n\\nThere were some really fantastic moments\\, however there was way too much useless parts and horrible new characters. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a lot of fun\\, but it could have been way better.","true":true}
