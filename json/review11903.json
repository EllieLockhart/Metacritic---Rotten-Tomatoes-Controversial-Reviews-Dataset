Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment. Obviously was a mistake to have different directors. To begin with\\, the movie was too long. Had a couple pointless subplots. The movie had several serious moments that were ruined by a cheesy joke. Also\\, a couple things that didn't make sense. (Spoilers). For example\\, there was a rebel down in the bomb bay with the doors open in space. Somehow\\, with no gear\\, she isn't sucked into the vacuum of space or suffocates. Then\\, they killed all the wrong characters. Snoke died without knowing anything about him. Leia didn't die despite freezing in space and Carrie Fisher passing away. Captain Phasma died for no reason. Finn should have died crashing into the 'death star' cannon. Rose should have died after crashing into Finn. Luke died for no reason. The mouse messed up one of the greatest franchises.","true":true}
