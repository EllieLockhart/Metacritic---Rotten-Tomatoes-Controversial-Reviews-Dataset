Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good film. It bridged back to the original film with great fx & decent acting but the story went inside the characters\u2014more cerebral\\, almost Shakespearean at moments. Not your kid siblings Star Wars.
