Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly disappointing and a blatant character assassination of Luke Skywalker in order for Bob Iger\\, Lucasfilm\\, and Disney to capitalize on the new faces of their trilogy and cast away characters whom as an society we have become attached to. Besides that point alone\\, there are several lapses in plot regarding the cast that simply would require a further in depth analysis to cover let alone the disappointment of Snoke and Rey that had been set up from the last film Luke was right about one thing - it's time for the Jedi to end.. and the Star Wars brand.","true":true}
