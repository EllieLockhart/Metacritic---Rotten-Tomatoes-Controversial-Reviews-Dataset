Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars film i have ever seen. it is quite astonishing at how badly written and ill-thought out everything in this film is. i walked out of the cinema half way through this film\\, during the excruciatingly bad and pointless casino planet scenes. The previous part of the film was dull and nonsensical with ludicrous character motivations. i recently watched the film all the way through and it does not get better. this film has absolutely killed my love of the saga.","true":true}
