Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, there are things I would have done differently\\, but this is a Star Wars\\, middle episode. It did what it had to do and left us ready for the final chapter.  I may not like what happened between Return of the Jedi and this one\\, but that is where it gets its power.","true":true}
