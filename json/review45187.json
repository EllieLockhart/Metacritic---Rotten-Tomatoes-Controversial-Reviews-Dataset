Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike many viewers of The Last Jedi\\, I found the film to be interesting in its subversion of all fan expectations and manipulation of beloved characters in the servitude of larger narrative goals. However\\, some plot elements (even on subsequent viewings) left a little to be desired and I left the cinema less excited than I felt when leaving the Force Awakens in 2015... yet despite this I would recommend the film to anyone. It contains some stunning visuals and makes a real attempt at creating something new within a very well tread universe.","true":true}
