Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was by far the 2nd most disappointing film since phantom menace. Disney needs George Lucas or everyone involved with Rogue One at the helm. This trilogy has no sense of direction and no purpose other than to make money. The story has been absolutely amazingly terrible. SOS ","true":true}
