Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looked and sounded beautiful\\, but it had no SW soul. So\\, NO. I am not going back to see it again\\, and NO\\, I won't even spend my money on it when it's released on Bluray. EXTREMELY bad writing\\, i.e: There isn't gravity in open space\\, Luke was always an optimist\\, not a quitter\\, a forward thinker\\, fought relentlessly for just the hint of good in someone\\, ESPECIALLY family. No thought out at all. Complete disrespect for the Legacy established by the Original Trilogy\\, and worrying more about political correctness. Using the film as a forum or platform to promote political or social justice agendas. Included the useless and dumped or ignored the valuable. Blatantly decided to screw everyone over (especially the fans) by not developing characters and not explaining previous plot twists\\, without giving \\\"prequel\\\" styled explanations.","true":true}
