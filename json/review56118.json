Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So without giving too much away\\, this movie was disappointing. The characters behaved uncharacteristically different from how they were established in The Force Awakens\\, the storyline skips back and forth between different locations for no reason\\, and it introduces a lot of new elements that confuses the audience about why certain \\\"abilities\\\" weren't used in previous movies\\, given how absolutely overpowered they are.\\n\\nOn top of that\\, Rian Johnson is apparently a really poor writer of dialogue and added in a lot of little bits of humour and cliches in scenes that took the audience out of the moment. (In a bad way) It felt like he was given an introduction to a book he was supposed to finish\\, and in his first chapter he went out of his way to force changes to as much of the original story as possible\\, just for the sake of change. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this movie\\, but at the end of the day it was just too disconnected and tried to force (pun intended) too many plot lines to end that I came out confused and worried about what the final movie would look like.\\n\\nUpdate: I've since seen it again and updated (reduced) my rating to 1.5 stars\\, saved from a lower score only because the visuals were excellent. To me\\, this movie suffers from the same issues that Valerian did this year; a compelling universe that was ruined by writers not fully understanding the characters they were supposed to be representing\\, and disappointing many of the original fans in the process.","true":true}
