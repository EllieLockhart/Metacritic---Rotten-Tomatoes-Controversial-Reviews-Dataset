Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Acting and CGI was good. Terrible \\\"star wars\\\" movie that goes out of its way for SJW. Rey IS a mary sue. Plot lines to nowhere......nowhere.....","true":true}
