Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted this movie to fail. Hated EP7\\, hated the casting (Minus Daisy & Boyega)\\, hated the story and especially hated Adam. Congrats to Rian for restoring (a little bit) of faith on the new Star Wars movies. No spoilers\\, this movie was AMAZING! I am... satisfied with how it ended... and there were so many epic moments we've never seen. All the hooplah surrounding Rian is justified... for now.","true":true}
