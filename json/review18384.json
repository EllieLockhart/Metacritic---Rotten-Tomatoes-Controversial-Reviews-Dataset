Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it is a decent movie but it is not a star wars movie it shares nothing but the name of the original star wars movie don't recommend watching if you are a fan of star wars and expect star wars","true":true}
