Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Objectively the worst Star Wars movie\\, riddled with plot holes\\, no respect for anything that was previously established in the saga. Seemed to be more about the director's ego and subverting pretty much every expectation than about telling a decent\\, coherent story. No tangible emotion\\, on the nose political statements that should have been conveyed through drama rather than exposition. Entire plot strands which served no purpose.\\n\\nBy far the least visually interesting of any Star Wars film\\, made the Galaxy Far Far Away feel very small. Even the sublime music of John Williams was dragged down by the gloomy\\, turgid plot\\, unable to soar to it's emotional heights. \\n\\nI really\\, really don't like having to write anything like this about my beloved Star Wars but this movie was a turd and all that remains for the sequel trilogy's final act is an exercise in damage limitation by JJ Abrams.","true":true}
