Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did this movie really happen?  How can anyone possibly like this movie?  So many plot holes\\, contradictions\\, horrible fight scenes\\, absurd sets\\, poor character development\\, and I can go on.  I have seen every Star Wars film in the theatre.  I have never been this disappointed and angry at a movie.  The audience in my theatre left pretty much with the same reaction as mine.  I heard 'that was horrible' and 'what did they do to star wars\\,' or even 'Star Wars died tonight.'  My son who has seen the last four on opening night with me said 'that was really bad.'  \\n\\nI can promise you I won't be seeing another Star Wars movie after this.  That is how insulting this movie was.  Don't believe me?  You'll see how many like me won't see it by the Box Office returns of the next movie.","true":true}
