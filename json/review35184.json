Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force is NOT with this one\\n\\nDisney has sent Star Wars into a galaxy so extraordinarily far away that I can't tell if it's even in the same universe as the original story. I don't think it is. I wont begin to add to the already long list of  inconsistencies\\, lack of character development\\, and blatant disregard of a coherent  continumn of the Star Wars saga. There is no saga here. I left the theater void of any feeling of excitement or joy. I did\\, however leave with absolutely no interest whatsoever in seeing where the story goes from here. I would rather watch the prequels I II and III over and over again than be subject to this complete fiasco. If you feel the Force now\\, you won't once you subject yourself to this one. Don't go.","true":true}
