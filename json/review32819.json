{"101487":170418,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars - The Last Jedi (weakest Star Wars till date)\\n\\nSince the unexpected and supremely brilliant Force Awakens came out\\, I've had really high expectations from the modern-day reincarnation of Star Wars. The Force Awakens relied on the nostalgia of The New Hope and it worked really well. Considering that dramatically Episode IV was so sorted\\, I think that this was the perfect way to re-introduce Star Wars to a modern audience. The follow-up off-spin too was great. It was deliberate\\, thoughtful but most importantly focused and not shying to dwell into drama. Within this context comes Star Wars - The Last Jedi. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, unfortunately\\, is a mess\\, though a technically brilliant mess but a mess nonetheless. I'll tackle the issues one by one. It's literally death by a thousand cuts for this film. It doesn't do things catastrophically wrong\\, but it screws up with many small but pivotal things at once. \\n\\n1a) THE PLOT -  or rather the lack of it. Like my brother stated\\, \\\"jahan se shuru hoti hai\\, wahin pe khatam hoti hai\\\"\\, and I couldn't agree more. Characters don't move forward in any meaningful way. The plot too is pretty much non-existent. All it does it tie up some thread plots but there is a serious lack of forward momentum. Whereas\\, The Empire Strikes Back (the BEST Star Wars\\, period) ended with \\\"I AM YOUR FATHER\\\" moment\\, resulting in one of those 2nd in a trilogy film\\, which have a brilliant climax and yet sets the next one. The Last Jedi\\, however\\, does not have an end aim. The climax is non-existent\\, and the stakes just don't feel high enough. What exactly is the end-game? \\n\\n1b) THE THREAD INVOLVING FINN AND ROSE (Spoilers) - So there is a full 30-35-minute thread dedicated to these two where they are tasked with infiltrating the Orders' Main Ship and to disable it's tracking device. So far so good. They go to this planet\\, in order to find a hacker\\, have an elongated chase sequence\\, get the wrong guy\\, board the main ship\\, get caught and basically do nothing! So\\, you have 35+ minutes of screen time which literally adds nothing to the core story or fits in the larger schema of things. It only introduces the romance between Finn and Rose\\, some random liberal top1% propaganda\\, PETA animal cruelty campaign and that's basically about it. Considering the amount of time spent in the Force Awakens to establish Finn as a character\\, to him basically doing nothing meaningful in this film was a downer. \\n\\n2) LACK OF DRAMA - The film had so much of dramatic potential\\, but the writers just squandered it. The film lacks a gut-punching scene or any scene which evokes some kind of an emotion. It's decently executed\\, but supremely generic. How does Rey realize her potential? The Empire Strikes Back had a whole sequence dedicated to Luke being stranded and figuring out how to master the force so that he can escape the planet and join the battle. His motivations are set\\, and his actions have agency\\, Luke goes through the struggle before becoming a master. Rey just does it\\, goes through no hardship\\, she just gets it! Her character too is supremely one dimensional. Poe aka new age Han Solo lacks any kind of personality. What The Last Jedi doesn't get is the fact that the original trilogy\\, not only played with archetypes (the rebel\\, the outlaw etc) but made sure that they were fitted with an equally charming personality. In this movie\\, however\\, everyone sans Luke lacks personality in their characters. They are just harbingers of actions with no purpose and nothing else in between. It's all too generic\\, the plot\\, the motivations\\, the set-pieces. \\n\\n3) LACK OF HEROISM - The film deviates from its 'western' roots to something which is well\\, universal as well as generic. You do get a feeling that this is more of a feminine film (female commanders\/fighters all of a sudden)\\, which is fine. But then (spoiler alert)\\, fleeing instead of leading the charge and not doing something of consequence is not exactly I say 'dramatic'. Where is the dramatic sacrifice (apart from one scene)? Where is the heroism? And the most heroic guy (Poe) gets reprimanded for it! Where is the risk-taking? And where is the audacity? There is a massive undertone of feminism and equal representation which is fine as long as it is not at odds with the well-being of the film. Give everyone a chance but not at the expense of the plot. It almost feels like a quota system with equal representation at work. Ok\\, so let's give our female lead a scene\\, follow it up with a scene of the black guy and mix him with a South-East Asian. Now\\, get the female queen and then the legendary Luke......rinse\/repeat and everyone go out happy. As a result\\, what suffers are the characters. No one is given enough time to cook\\, no plot thread is taken to its logical conclusion. It's corporate flattening at its worst. This flattening strips the film with any kind of personality it could have possessed. Even the set-pieces are generic. It starts off well\\, but then you have your basic CGI powered\\, pretty looking scenes where people hurl swords and lasers at each other. Where is the dramatic action\\, the heroic moment equivalent of Luke firing the impossible shot to destroy Death Star or I am your Father moment? What is the setup of the action scene? Rogue One in this regard did a fantastic job of it. It had a plot\\, the end game\\, heroism\\, sacrifice and brilliant set pieces all in equal measure.\\n\\n The action here is devoid of drama and urgency. Even (SUPER DUPER SPOILER) Luke dies in a supremely uneventful way. Like C'mon. Luke is Sci-Fi action hero incarnate. The destroyer of Death Star and Vader and you kill him like this? His death should have been bombastic\\, instead\\, it's a whimper. All he does is brood and milk lactating aliens :\/ You just don't screw with the character of Luke Skywalker like this.... case closed. For Rey\\, what's her heroism? She can lift Rocks!! Great! She thinks she can change a bad boy in her own image\\, even better! \\n\\nAs one of the viewers on Metacritic said\\, \\\"Here's a stat for you... BB-8 kills more ppl in this film than Luke & Snoke combined lol! This is one of the worst Star Wars films ever!\\\"\\n\\n4) KYLO REN - \\\"Jhaatu hai yeh banda\\\"\\, I exclaimed as I saw n'th number of his close-up shot. Seriously\\, this character is THE WEAKEST LINK in the film. Vader inspired dread\\, Skywalker inspired Heroism\\, this guy just inspires pity! All he does is sulk and cry and behave like a baby. How can this character be taken seriously let alone villainous? And here is the crux\\, the villains don't seem villainous enough. With these people at command\\, who will fear the Order? Kylo Ren is just pitiful. \\n\\n5) MISPLACED HUMOR - Star Wars usually have had its share of humour. The banter between C3PO and R2D2\\, Han Solo's one-liners. But they were treated in an almost Shakespearean way\\, i.e. there were scenes set aside for comic relief. Here\\, unfortunately\\, jokes come at the most inopportune dramatic moment. Villains lose their power when their action ends in humour\\, or Luke his heroism when (spoiler) after being attacked from multiple Tie-Fighters and AT-Ts shrugs dust from his shoulders. It just kills the emotion. This technique is called 'BATHOS' and just like most of the Marvel films sans Guardians\\, it doesn't work here as well. Too forced\\, stripping the dramatic moment of its efficacy. \\n\\nAll in all\\, The Last Jedi is one of the weakest Star Wars movie. The amount of pivotal things it gets wrong is truly baffling. Random Left Wing propaganda and feminist undertones to literally everything were not required at all. That's not what you expect from a Star Wars film\\, especially when it has been preceded by the excellent Rogue One and The Force Awakens. The film is generic\\, too generic in fact. It was an excellent opportunity to take the series to a bold new direction\\, but unfortunately like Luke's X Wings in Empire Strikes Back\\, this film is stuck in a swamp. Hope the force is strong with the next instalment and I dare say with it possessing a bit more heroism and pathos. \\n\\nP.S. - The owl creatures are cute\\, but c'mon\\, they gotta serve a purpose!","true":true}
