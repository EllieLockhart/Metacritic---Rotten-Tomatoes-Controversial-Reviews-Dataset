Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very boring and had SJW garbage shoved in it with left leaning political views. I go to the movies to enjoy and have fun. I did not and this was the worst Star Wars I have seen worse then number 7. There is so many things wrong it would take me an hour to explain all the things wrong with this mess of a movie that had ripped out of my heart and killed the movie as a fan for me. Feminist and SJW's just know how to kill the thing's you love they don't make anything. Why are critics at 91%? This was not even a 65% it was a 20 at best and that's only cause it looked good as in graphics and the sound and music wasn't bad that's it. Making Yoda use force lighting that is not a Jedi power. Making Luke someone that isn't anything of the original movies. There is so many issues with this shit movie. Rian Johnson is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars in it's universe he killed everything about it no Sith has ever done that. I guess if ruining the Star Wars universe was his plot good job Rian.","true":true}
