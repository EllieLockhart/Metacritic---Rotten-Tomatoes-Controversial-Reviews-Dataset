Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film wasn't exactly what I had in mind. It wasn't exactly a Star Wars film but that's what makes it great. This film explores themes in a way no Star Wars film has before. It seems to have taken more of TV universe route\\, a bit like the Clone Wars and Rebels\\, and still quintessentially Star Wars. The Last Jedi was packed full of new creatures (the vulptex were gorgeous)\\, interesting aliens\\, brand new worlds\\, and characters I only want to know more about. I look forward to the next two years of speculating and theorizing that this film has provided.","true":true}
