Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi certainly heard the criticism of the Force Awakens and took a risk. Whether the risk paid off is something that will not be settled until the trilogy concludes\\, possibly ever. But personally\\, I would like to salute director and writer Rian Johnson for taking that risk. The new and darker Luke Skywalker takes some getting used to but I was a huge fan. It really adds layers to a character we thought we knew so well. The much anticipated reveal of Rey's parents was without controversy\\, but personally I thought it was the best fit for the plot. The reboot of the franchise has done a great job with the casting so far (how good was Del Toro with his limited screen time)\\, but Kelly Marie Tran? Really? From dialogue to facial expression\\, she was terrible throughout and every one of her scenes was borderline unbearable. Part of me was disappointed she survived the crash just because it means we'll have to see her again in the next installment. My main complaint was that the Last Jedi might have tried a little too hard to entertain\\, with some cheesy moments and cute creatures. But hey\\, there's a wide range of audience the movie has to appeal to. The Last Jedi set the perfect stage for a different spin on a classic. Let's hope the next chapter in the saga does not disappoint.","true":true}
