Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reason so many people around the world love the Game of Thrones is that 1) the villains are fantastic and 2) there's always a sense that your favorite protagonist could be killed at any moment. These two things create tension and keep us glued to the show\\, because we want to see the  moment when the villain finally gets his (or hers) or to ensure our hero survives the next episode. In this Star Wars reboot\\, neither of these things exist. Kylo Ren could be an awesome villain\\, but so far he's lost a fight to hologram Luke and Rey the first time she picked up a lightsaber. Snoke\\, who's backstory dealth with whatsoever\\, gets killed like an idiot. Captain Phasma\\, aka Space Brianne of Tarth\\, gets beaten so bad by Finn\\, you wonder why she was in the movie in the first place. Rey's a juggernaut of a character with no internal struggle and is impossibly awesome at everything\\, and you have Kylo Ren\\, who's stroyline emulates just about any son of an NBA HOFer: nobody what you do\\, you're going to end up being a disappointment. Honestly don't know what really remains of this storyline that's going to sell people on the final movie of the trilogy. JJ has his work cut out for him.","true":true}
