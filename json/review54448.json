Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm honestly conflicted about this movie\\, when I watched it for the first and only time I would probably give it 4\/5 stars but after I've thought about it I might give it 3\/5 stars.  This movie had so many jaw-dropping moments and some of the most exciting moments for me but also a lot of moments that are insanely awkward\\, out-of place\\, and\/or flat out gross. Since I'm so conflicted about this movie I'll settle with 2.5 for now.","true":true}
