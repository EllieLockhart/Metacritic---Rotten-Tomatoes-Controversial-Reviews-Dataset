Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good things: \\n+interesting choice of planets for Luke and the final battle \\n+Force Skype \\n+Rey not being connected to the royal family of the galaxy\\n\\nBad things: \\n-incoherent storytelling \\n-too much focus on creating jawdropping moments like the hyperspace kamikaze instead of developing characters\\n- Rey's evolution into a bigger Mary Sue: she even manages to best Luke in a battle; fights with rage and yells and somehow we are supposed to believe she's the ultimate \\\"light\\\" in the galaxy...\\n\\n- Poe's positioning as an arrogant jock who should be kept out of life or death decisions because women know better(?)\\n\\n- Finn goes to Jakku in TFA\\, can't stomach First Order's atrocities\\, starts running\\, meets Rey\\, continues to run; sees her getting captured and decides to stand up and fight. Takes on one of the strongest Force users in the galaxy\\, gets his spine cauterized\\, goes to coma\\, wakes up in TLJ and...... starts running away from First Order again\\, before being stunned by an irrelevant character who tells him that suicide missions don't win wars\\, saving those we love does. How exactly\\, is not explained. \\n\\n- I won't get started about Luke and Leia. It is sad to see Disney destroying established characters to create \\\"OMG\\\" moments \\n\\n- making ALL aliens and droids irrelevant to central story. Great diversity message \\n\\nOverall point of the movie is apparently to raise hope because... the republic that was established after Palpatine's death could not take on a simple band of zealots and only 30-40 people in a galaxy of trillions of beings (almost all humans by the way) choose to stand up against it.","true":true}
