Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: So many plot holes that it's taken the enjoyment out of this movie for me. Where were the dreadnought's shields? If it's so easy to destroy large ships by jumping into light speed thru one\\, why has that not been done more? Why do ships not have auto pilot\\, or instruct a droid to fly the ship\\, why did Admiral Holdo have to go down with the ship? Wasn't Leia unconscious long enough in the void of space to have died before her force powers kicked in? Finn was the only target for AT-ATs\\, why did no one shot him when he was going for the cannon? How did he drag a body back to the base before the AT-ATs got there? Phasma was under used. The casino subplot really dragged the movie down and was so obviously pushing a political message that it was annoying and accomplished nothing besides introducing DJ who I'm assuming will be a bigger part of the next movie. Who is Snoke? Guess we'll never know... How was Ray so talented with the force and lightsaber with such little training\\, sure she got some with Luke this movie\\, but not much? Did not leave me on edge about what comes next. I will not be seeing the next installment.","true":true}
