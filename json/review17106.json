Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. Has it all\\, good and bad\\, but certainly original and must watch. Stay away from social media and make up your own mind. Had one of the most amazing cinematography I have seen in cinema. Can't wait to see what happens next.","true":true}
