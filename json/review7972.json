Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely excited that risks were taken. Star Wars is my number one fandom\\, and I'm enjoying where the new trilogy is taking us. Would call out specific scenes\\, but will not spoil anything. Links to other films\\, including Rogue One\\, tie all the movies together beautifully. The force works in mysterious ways\\, and personally don't feel that every force power has been discovered or used yet. Looking forward to future installments!!","true":true}
