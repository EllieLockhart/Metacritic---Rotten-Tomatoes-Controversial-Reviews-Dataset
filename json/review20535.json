Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've had nearly 48 hours to think about it and let it settle in. But I'm going to be honest and quick here. Disney and Lucasfilm shit all over the franchise. Forget about Snoke\\, forget about Phasma\\, forget about the force\\, forget about Luke\\, The Jedi\\, The Sith\\, forget everything you loved about Luke Skywalker and his life. Disney shit a massive brick all over the franchise and changed EVERYTHING. That's pretty much it from me. Star Wars is dead. I'll stick to my old canon novels and original six films\\, those are Star Wars.","true":true}
