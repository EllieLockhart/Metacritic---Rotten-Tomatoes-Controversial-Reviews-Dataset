Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"::CONTAINS SPOILERS::??This movie disappoints on so many levels.  There are moments of awesomeness only to be undone by complete stupidity.  Look Disney\\, not everyone wants young people running the show\\, not all adults are complete f***** idiots\\, and not all elders need to die in your movies.  I mean come on.  You rewrote the movie so Leia lives??  WTF are you thinking?  You killed Luke to force Ray into a lead role that she should have taken organically.  There are TOO many parallels to the originals to the point of satire.  And I'm so tired of the social justice lectures.  This is a movie that could have been great and somebody at Disney won a few battles of where this movie SHOULD have ended up.  Ultimately\\, the mouse took down the house.  R.I.P Star Wars.","true":true}
