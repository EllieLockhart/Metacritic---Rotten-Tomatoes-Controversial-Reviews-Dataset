Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sorry to say that this movie did little to nothing to advance the franchise of Star Wars.  In fact it did a lot of damage.  The story writing was bland and the movie editing techniques were poor.  Strong story writing raises all characters to the next level.  It is not totally dafaming some characters in order to raise others up.Furthermore it leaves us with little to look forward to.  If the Mantra of Star Wars is Hope  against all odds\\, this movie did what it told me I need to to  It Failed in all categories except one.  the visuals were great\\, and that is all credited to the CGI team and not the director or the producers.  Episode 9 has it's work cut out for it.  Good Luck JJ.","true":true}
