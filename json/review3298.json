Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a star wars fan since 1977 when I saw the first movie with my parents at 11 years old. Going to borrow from an excellent write up on Forbes by Erik Kain...It's a movie that takes what we know and love about Star Wars and turns all of that on its head. It's wonderful\\, surprising and even a little bittersweet. But ultimately\\, stripping away some of the mythology gives Star Wars more depth\\, enriching the stories that came before and opening the door for even greater things to come.\\nI couldn't agree more. Go see it and be open minded. You won't be dissapointed.","true":true}
