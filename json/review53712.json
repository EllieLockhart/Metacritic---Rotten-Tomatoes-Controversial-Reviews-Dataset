Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great job furthering the plot of the new trilogy. Although it deviated from the typical Star Wars movie format\\, it kept audience members on the edge of their seats. The story line was fast paced and captivating\\, and the movie did a wonderful job of cast diversification. Although maybe not appealing to some viewers\\, I believe this movie is the Star Wars for the next generation. Through a progressive cast and rich social commentary\\, Star Wars has once again created a captivating\\, escapist universe that also manages to reflect back on today's society through subtle themes and plot points.","true":true}
