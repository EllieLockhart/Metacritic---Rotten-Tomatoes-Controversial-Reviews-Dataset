Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie isn't awful as their is one great scene when Rey and Ren fight of Snokes guards after he's cut in half. The first battle ain't that bad and the last scene also. But nonetheless the movie was a waste\\, some good scenes here and there but here's a list:\\n1) unnessary scenes\\, such as the casino part \\n2) leia survives an explosion on the bridge and the vacuum of space\\, by floating back using the force. (Thought I was watching Man of Steel. \\n3) Did not like roses character\\, found her to be extremely boring\\, along with finns character to also be very pointless in the movie.\\n4) no questions were really answered from TFA\\, such as who is snoke\\, reys parents ( although ren said they were drunkens who sold her for drinking money\\, if this is true then I weep for the future of the third instalment).\\n5) basically the whole plot of the movie was a ship running out of fuel\\, while being chased by the first order and about Luke whining and pretty much having no real sense of \\\"importance\\\"\\, until the last 5 minutes. Other than that he's just sitting and getting collecting space cow milk. \\n\\n However a positive - Kylo ren is pretty cool in this and isn't as much of a baby or weakling in this\\, they've stepped up his character. Reys acting is also very good.","true":true}
