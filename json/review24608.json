Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"movie ruined my fandom\\n\\nPUZZLING plot holes and puzzling plot. 1) The fill in general for princess leia of the rebels doesnt tell her team where they going as they are running out of fuel? why not just tell her team instead of causing unnecessary suspicion. 2) the first order could've just lightspeed ahead and destroy them 3) destroyed luke's character and growth 4) casino scene just a random distraction. I enjoyed some star wars but this one kind of killed it for me.","true":true}
