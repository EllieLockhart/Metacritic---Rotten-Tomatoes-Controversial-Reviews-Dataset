Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Save for a scene or two (particularly one with Leia)\\, this movie was incredible! It definitely wasn't what I had expected\\, but in the best way possible; The Force Awakens was good but it was also insanely predictable. I get why people are complaining about Luke\\, but I think it's mostly because we've all had 30 years and a bunch of EU stories to build up our headcanon and this version is so much different. Rey and Kylo Ren both get some great character development and completely steal the show! If you love Star Wars and can \\\"let go\\\" of your preconceived notions (as Obi-Wan would say)\\, you'll definitely enjoy this movie. Above all\\, it's just great to have another solid Star Wars movie!","true":true}
