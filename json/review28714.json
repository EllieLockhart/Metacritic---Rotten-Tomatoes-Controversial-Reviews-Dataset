Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Put simply\\, this movie is dull\\, retcon garbage\\, with a story that sounds as though the writer didn't know\\, or want to know how this universe works. Destroying  narrative tropes left and right doesn't make you a visionary.  It makes you a lazy try hard.  But Ryan Johnson wasn't simply content with destroying this movie\\, but destroying any chance the follow up to this movie will be any good either by killing off the primary antagonist and guaranteeing that the follow up has to engage in some serious mental gymnastics to even make it half way interesting.","true":true}
