Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in the last few years. The script was completely uncompelling and scattered with cringeworthy moments that unraveled any immersion Daisy Ridley was able to build. I feel embarrassed that I added to the box office numbers. Hopefully potential viewers\\,  wiser than I\\,  read the user reviews and ignore the inflated critic scoring of this film.","true":true}
