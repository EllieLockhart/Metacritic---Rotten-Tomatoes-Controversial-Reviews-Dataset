Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not understand the hate at all. Is it a perfect movie? No. Does it put the prequels to shame? Yes. Did it introduce some cool new things and cast off some old chains? Oh yeah. Does it have me interested in what happens next? Absolutely.","true":true}
