Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many online reviewers are acting as though this is the last chapter of the saga rather than the middle installment. Fans need to relax and let this story play out.  Criticizing Rian Johnson for this middle sequel is like criticizing Peter Jackson for killing off Gandalf in the first chapter of LOTR.  Relax people and enjoy the ride.....the best is yet to come.","true":true}
