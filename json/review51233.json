Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved this newest entry into the Star Wars universe. The character journeys that take place are all very fascinating. Ryan Johnson is a master filmmaker and understands this world very well. The visuals are breathtaking and keeps the audience visually locked into the film. The is a surprising twist that takes place about 2\/3s of the way through the film that was truly shocking. Answers to questions that arose in The Force Awakens are answered and new ones arise in this piece. One can not really go too in depth with a review of this film without spoiling the big plot points it contains. I strongly suggest going to see this in the theaters. It was made for the theater experience. ","true":true}
