Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe this script made it past anyone\\, an actor\\, producer\\, the janitor\\, anyone.  Every single commanding member of the resistance were imbeciles.  No one did anything that mattered\\, and the scale of a movie that claims to be 'war' was laughable.  DO NOT SEE THIS\\, DON'T LET IT RUIN A PREVIOUSLY GREAT FRANCHISE.","true":true}
