Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a complete disaster\\, and made Rogue One look like Citizen Kane.  The writing was horrendous; fully half the movie is dedicated to a subplot that goes nowhere and is ultimately pointless.  The level of cringe inducing scenes was truly amazing to behold - I must have had my palm in my face for at least half the movie\\, and could only laugh at some parts at how bad everything was.  The only reason this movie earns half a star is because the actors do a great job despite the garbage tier level of material they have to work with - except the new Asian lead; she was pretty bad.","true":true}
