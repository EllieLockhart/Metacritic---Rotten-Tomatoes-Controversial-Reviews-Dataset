Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie so much. I thought maybe was just in a bad mood the first time I saw it\\, so I tried to watch it two more times. It was so disjointed I just couldn't get through it. Then I showed it to my 7-year old and he lost interest after the first 5 minutes. I tried fast forwarding through the non-action parts to find a point in the movie that would engage him and got to the last battle scene before he showed any interest at all. When the big Astral Projection surprise was revealed he looked at me and said \\\"that's dumb.\\\"","true":true}
