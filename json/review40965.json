Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not contain surprising or interesting twists. It contains forced and confused\\, half-ass\\, decisions that have no flow\\, no personality\\, and no soul. They ruined\\, absolutely ruined Luke Skywalker's nobility and optimism\\, his strength. He turned Darth Vader but lost his entire character over his bratty nephew?...that is so dumb it cannot be put into words. I just cannot believe what I saw up on that screen. Super disappointing.","true":true}
