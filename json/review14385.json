Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had fun while I was watching the film except for the Luke ending and Snoke Ending. \\nAfter the movie when the Euphoria of seeing a star wars film wore off\\, the more I thought about it\\, the more I got pissed because the movie didn't make any sense. Luke was disrespected\\, Rian Johnson crapped on every story element TFA set up.\\n\\nBecause these directors\/writers are making this shit up as they go along\\, I have no desire to see Episode 9 and see whate JJ Abrams retcons randomly because you can change anything you don't like from movie and movie and the movie having almost no connection to each other.","true":true}
