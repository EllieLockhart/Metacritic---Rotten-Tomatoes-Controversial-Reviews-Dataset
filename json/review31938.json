Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler Free) This felt like a good continuation of the new trilogy. The character development progresses in a pleasing way that I can see advancing even more so in the next film. I do not understand the people who are saying this is the worst movie of all the Star Wars... Not even close; get your head out of your ass and look at the prequels. With that said\\, it is by no means a perfect movie\\, it does have a few shortcomings. I will most definitely be seeing it again.","true":true}
