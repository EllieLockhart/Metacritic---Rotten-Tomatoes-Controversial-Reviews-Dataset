Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's movie is a mess. His interpretation of Luke Skywalker is awful and makes no sense. The cantina scene is completely useless and is basically just to give Finn something to do. There are some fun things in the movie\\, but overall it is a mess and will leave long-time Star Wars fans feeling unsatisfied. It's a shame and alarming that Disney is trusting Johnson with the next trilogy.","true":true}
