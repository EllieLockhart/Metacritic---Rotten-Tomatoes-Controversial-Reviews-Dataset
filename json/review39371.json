Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is half a movie.  It ends up being the same as Empire Strikes Back.  It's fine to show failure in a movie but if the movie doesn't show what the protagonists learn from it and how they apply it to the story then the story is not complete. Can I have half my money back please?","true":true}
