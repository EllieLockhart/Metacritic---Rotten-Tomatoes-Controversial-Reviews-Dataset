Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, usually I like to give my usual speech about the film\\, but I don\u2019t want anyone to think I\u2019ll spoil anything\\, so I might as well jump into my thoughts on one of the biggest films of 2017\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. So the film takes place shorty after The Force Awakens\\, and Rey has found Luke Skywalker\\, who has abandoned himself to a remote island. Meanwhile\\, The First Order is closing in on the Resistance and Kylo Ren\u2019s emotional conflict grows even stronger under Snoke\u2019s command. One thing i really enjoyed is the original cast Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher really deliver some great performances in their respective roles. You feel the sense they have both gone through some tough experiences over this time and it weighs on their roles well. I was a defender of Kylo Ren\u2019s inexperience in The Force Awakens and i feel it\u2019s paying off as his conflict makes him more interesting to watch as a villain to see where he goes. And there are some really rousing and exciting space fights and lightsaber battles throughout this movie with some great cinematography to compliment the action. As time progresses\\, i did notice that the film does rely on humor that comes in at the wrong time at points in the midst of a big moment. Also\\, there is a subplot that involves Finn and Rose that just isn\u2019t sharply written enough to buy into\\, and becomes hard to be invested despite the film giving it a lot of time on screen. And there\u2019s one scene.... I don\u2019t want to go to detail\\, but I\u2019ll just simply say \u201cI have so many questions! \u201c Star Wars: The Last Jedi shows it\u2019s not afraid to take some risks with well beloved characters. The action is still fun and more refined\\, and is able to keep you curious for the future. It does have some narrative flaws\\, but the force is still strong with this one.","true":true}
