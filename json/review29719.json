Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson was not merely the director\\, but also the writer for The Last Jedi.  Insofar as he played both critical roles\\, this is his film\\, and every aspect of it belongs firmly to him.\\n\\nThis film is an insult to the character development that George Lucas spent five decades developing so very carefully.  Say what one will about the mixed results of Lucas' directorship of the previous Star Wars movies\\, but he would have never depicted Luke Skywalker as a crazy-eyed mad man looking to ignite his lightsaber and murder his nephew in his sleep!\\n\\nThat entirely preposterous plot line was not only presented in The Last Jedi\\, it was focused on as the seminal moment when Luke Skywalker saw his Jedi Academy destroyed by Kylo Renn.  But\\, the academy Luke created was destroyed by Renn only after Luke tried to murder him in his sleep!\\n\\nImagine Yoda and Mace Windu sneaking into Anakin Skywalker's room to murder him\\, Anakin waking up to the treachery barely in time\\, defeating the attack\\, and then becoming Darth Vader!  That's pretty much how Rian Johnson chose to depict the pivotal moment of Ben Solo's descent into the dark side of the force -- by Luke Skywalker sensing darkness in Solo and deciding that the only acceptable answer was to sneak into his room to murder him in his sleep!\\n\\nEvery other piece of hokum about this script rings true.  The Leia space walk to escape certain death\\, the Luke refusing to train a Padawan\\, who\\, it turns out\\, never really needed any training at all.  And\\, sadly\\, there is so much more that rings wrong and hollow about this movie.\\n\\nIt all adds up to a director who seems like he dedicated his opportunity to insult George Lucas and destroy what he so carefully constructed.\\n\\nI must think George Lucas is much like Luke Skywalker in this movie\\, huddled in isolation\\, in deep morose\\, and regretting his terrible decision to sell his iconic franchise to the Disney corporation.","true":true}
