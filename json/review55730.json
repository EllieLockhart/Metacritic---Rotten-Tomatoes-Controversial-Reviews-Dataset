Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only lightsaber duel was like 5 seconds long in a flash back....seriously? Snoke was pointless\\, build up from The Force Awakens was totally disregarded with comedy. Still a decent movie with lots of cool scenes and emotion. Still better than the prequels but behind all the rest.","true":true}
