Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets the shinto inspiration right. The universe is one big circle\\, and many of the moments in this Starwars movie makes you say \\\"wait a second\\\" - we been here before - right from the Emporer showdown in Starwars 6 to the young boy looking up at the stars in Starwars 1 and to the imperial assualt in Starwars 5 - but adds new twists and takes as different characters make different choices.","true":true}
