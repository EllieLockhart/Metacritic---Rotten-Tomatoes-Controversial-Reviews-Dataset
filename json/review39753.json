Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a horribly written story full of plot holes\\, awkwardly bad humor\\, and unlikable new characters. Disney should really reconsider their direction and just give fans what they want by hiring new producers\\, writers\\, directors\\, and\/or consultants that are actual REAL genuine die hard Star Wars Fans that love and know what the Star Wars Universe is supposed to be like\\, because this is definitely not it. And guess what Disney... you would reap the rewards by satisfying the old fan base while also creating GREAT movies for the younger generations to come. It's a no brainer. Your welcome!","true":true}
