Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up for Rotten Tomatoes just to voice how awful this movie was. \\n\\nI will go crazy if I read another article or comment saying how bold and great the twists were!   What were the twists? Luke is a whiney dick who almost murdered his nephew as a kid. \\nRey is a random space orphan with all previous build up to her being a Skywalker thrown out. That is bad because the huge story of Star Wars is grounded by the Skywalker family and Rey as the new hero should carry that on. Snoke who was supposed to be the new ultimate evil gets the Darth Maul treatment. All the great work The Force Awakens did to set up the rest of the trilogy was destroyed by this movie.\\n\\nAlso anyone who likes The Last Jedi but complained about the lack of originality in The Force Awakens is completely full of it. They directly copied the last battle from Hoth\\, and the interaction with Snoke\\, Ben and Rey from the Emperor's throne room in Return of the Jedi. \\n\\nI do love the Porgs though\\, best part of the movie.","true":true}
