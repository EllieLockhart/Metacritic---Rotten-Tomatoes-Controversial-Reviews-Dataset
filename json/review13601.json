Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like the writing in this film was a disaster from the start - both dialogue and plot. And it just got worse as the movie continued. There were enough unnecessary scenes and dead-end scenes coupled with quite a few anti-climatic death scenes to diminish most of my sense of excitement or engagement with the film and most of it's characters. I felt like most of the character development was rushed and immature and the plot didn't move much from the start of the movie until the end of the movie. Even the score was less engaging than it was in Star Wars movies past. Overall the whole thing felt like it was written and directed by a committee with no singular visionary and it left me with ZERO desire to see Episode IX.","true":true}
