Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed the film!!! Lots of layers to each scene\\, it added a lot to our understanding of the Force and what the Jedi order will be in the future. The film is not perfect but it is a good representation of how to add more to a Star Wars film than just awesome CGI and lightsabers.","true":true}
