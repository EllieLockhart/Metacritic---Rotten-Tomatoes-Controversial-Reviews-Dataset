Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from a specific side plot and some lines meant to be funny\\, this movie is great. It pushes the franchise in a new and exciting direction that makes me so eager for what's about to come\\, specially from Rian Johnson. Rey is not so bland anymore\\, Kylo Ren is still a conflicted villain and Adam Drives gives an amazing performance just like Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher. The action sequences are no doubt the best in the whole franchise. Don;t expect an Empire rehash\\, this movie is not it.","true":true}
