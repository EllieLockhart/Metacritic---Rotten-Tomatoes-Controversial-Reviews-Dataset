Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has no substance. It is just a reshuffling of previously used cool looking scenes without any logic. Characters are unappealing (with the exception of Luke) and are mostly just a collection of obligatory racially diverse plastic toys. There is no mythic quality\\, no soul in the movie. Characters act nonsensically\\, it is really a pain to watch it. And the violet-haired woman is unbearable.","true":true}
