Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Twisting the lore and saving most of the action for the end the movie fails to deliver a fun action packed adventure. The directing is great and so is the acting and cinematography\\, but the script is so bland and a let down that it makes the rest of the movie bad in comparison.","true":true}
