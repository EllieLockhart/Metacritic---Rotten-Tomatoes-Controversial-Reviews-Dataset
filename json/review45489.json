Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in this movie. It was like they were trying to give a big middle finger to the Skywalker legacy and to George Lucas. Too many questions left unanswered and those that were were let downs. Too many silly scenes and the side mission did nothing to add to the story. Rey gets little to no training but is the most power Jedi ever? I hated what they did to Luke's character. The first time I\\, a life-long fan\\, ever left a Star Wars movie feeling underwhelmed and not caring what happens next.","true":true}
