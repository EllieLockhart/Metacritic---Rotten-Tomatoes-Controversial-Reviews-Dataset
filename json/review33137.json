Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointment. A few good sections\\, a pleasing scene between luke and Leia\\, and that's about it. The rest was a forced\\, patchy\\, overly cheesy mess\\, that in my opinion has wasted great characters and wiped out everything great about the originals. When I was a kid I wanted to be Luke Skywalker\\, would any kid now really want to be Rey or the extremely sensitive\/emotional wreck Finn?! \\nStill can't quite believe how poor it was.","true":true}
