Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only saving grace of this film is the music score and cinematography.  Rian Johnson's script absolutely ruined every story arc created in the Force Awakens and soiled the legacy of Luke Skywalker in one masterful stroke of destruction.  His \\\"creative\\\" touches are akin to a paint brush soaked in diarrhea.  The fact that he has been given creative reign over the follow on trilogy should frighten Disney and StarWars fans everywhere.","true":true}
