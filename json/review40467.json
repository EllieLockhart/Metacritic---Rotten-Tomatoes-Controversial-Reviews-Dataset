Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first time I posted on Rotten Tomatoes. But as a long time Star Wars fan I felt I had to give voice after watching this movie and seeing the hypocrisy of the \\\"Official Score\\\". Whatever hope I had for Disney in carrying on the spirit of Star Wars died with this film. They took one of our most beloved characters\\, disregarded all of the character developments from the original trilogy and assassinated his character. This is only one of the many issues I have with this film\\, but read on the and you'll hear similar criticism of the movie (along with spoilers) about why this movie doesn't deserve the rating it has.\\n\\nJust look at the divide between the audience score and the critics here (as well as Metacritic) and it will show you why critic opinions are\\, at best not reflective of the average viewer experience or at worse\\, paid off and influenced by the corporations that make the films and thus afraid to voice out a real opinion.","true":true}
