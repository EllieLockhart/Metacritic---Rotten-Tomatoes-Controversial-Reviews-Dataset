Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seems like Disney finally merged with the critics\\, too. The plot holes were so big\\, you can put star destroyers in them. Maybe even a death star. \\n\\nSo\\, the villain of episode 9 will be Kylo Ren? Snoke had potential to become a great villain like darth vader or the emperor. I even found Director Krennic in Rogue One more terrifying than Kylo Ren.\\n\\nThat ridiculous scene with Leia was unnecessary. But since Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios both belong to Disney now\\, some mixture was bound to happen :\/\\nI didn't like what Rian Johnson did to Luke in the end.\\nThen there was the subplot that lead to absolutely nothing. And all in all to many new minor characters\\, or even major characters like Finn's new love interest.\\nIf you can block all of this out\\, which I can't\\, it was still a very funny\\, suspenseful science-fiction action movie. 2\\,5 out of 5","true":true}
