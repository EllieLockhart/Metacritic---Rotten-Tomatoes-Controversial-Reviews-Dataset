Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely sad the direction Disney & the Director took this. The Skywalker Legend along with the old favorites were just cast aside like trash. Kids will love it true to the core fans will hate it.","true":true}
