Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie fails to deliver a clear story. Too many plot lines and jumping around makes it difficult to tell how much time is being covered and ultimately the movie watcher knows who will win and what will happen. It\u2019s nuts to me that such a large production with so much money can fail to deliver a half decent story. It also felt too much like a Marvel comic movie; too many visual effects and attempts to be funny. I felt like Jar Jar was going to pop up. Do better\\, Disney.","true":true}
