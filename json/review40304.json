Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best films I have seen in an age. It takes tired movie tropes and flips them on their heads. I'm not surprised a few narrow-minded folks are throwing their toys out of the pram - it won't serve you the same tired rubbish you're used to seeing\\, and that may upset some who want to basically see the same film with the same characters doing the same things over and over again","true":true}
