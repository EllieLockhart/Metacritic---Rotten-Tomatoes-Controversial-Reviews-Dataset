Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m 28 and a real starwars fan. I\u2019m one of them those who didnt liked the prequels\\, and who really loves ep7 (i teared up twice watching it) Ep8 is a kid movie. Nothing to do with a real starwars movie. Closer to the prequels then the real deal. This movie is so much in your face with the forced jokes and obvious plot. Id compare it to an avenger movie ( more into the comedie and action then plots and depth). ","true":true}
