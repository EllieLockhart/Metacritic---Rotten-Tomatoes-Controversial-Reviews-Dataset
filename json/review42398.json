Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely incredible and I do not understand some of the criticism that people our talking about in there reviews. Especially when it comes to character devoplment. Luke has one of the best character arc in a Star Wars movie ever\\, and in the end proves to be the jedi master. The cinematography is absolute gorgeous with some scenes taking your breath away. I understand that no movie is prefect and there were things that could be improved but this movie ranks as my second favorite Star Wars movie behind empire strikes back.","true":true}
