Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have not seen any trailers\\, I have had 0 expectations from the movie\\, trying my best not to get too disappointed. \\n\\nI have became disappointed. Brilliant scenes\\, soon ruined by... god knows what the writers\/director were thinking. Much like the critics\\, I have absolutely no idea how they give this movie a 93% rating.\\n\\nIt was short of a complete failure in my opinion. The movie\\, which\\, in essence\\, is about nothing\\, lacks that 'star wars' feeling to it. \\n\\nAgain\\, same mistakes as in The Force Awakens have been made; as well as many new ones.\\n\\nOn the bright side\\, it made The Force Awakens seem bit better.","true":true}
