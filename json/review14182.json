Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave it only two stars and that was more then generous. People used to argue about prequels\\, but comparing to them\\, this \\\"trilogy\\\" is utter pile of attempts how to destroy one of the most successful movie franchise ever. \\n\\nIllogical story\\, meaningless sub-plots and pointless and useless characters on rise\\, while killing the ones everybody cared about\\, following the story from the Force Awakens and \/ or from original trilogy.  \\n\\nStar Wars series become a ship without captain where each captain disprove course and actions of the previous one leading the ship to a new unknown. This is not creative attempt\\, it is example of bad and perplexed writing and even more horrible execution of the highly successful commercial project.","true":true}
