Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has been rated generously by major reviewers. I am trying to show the potential viewers the smoke and illusions played by Disney's team and resources to sell their product by masking its poor quality. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" has received decent review because of its involvement within the Star Wars universe\\, but the fans are not satisfied with the lack of a completed story. (No meant for those involved in the making of the film the production value and acting. You did an amazing job with what you were given sadly what you were given was a bumpy\\, confusing\\,and indiscreet formulation of the story.) The film does not answer and major questions proposed from the previous \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, but to those that were answered they were given no in depth thought or satisfying conclusion. Main events and scenes did not make sense and felt completely separate. The unrealistic qualities of this movie amaze the viewer and are absurd given the previous films and series lore. Previous nostalgic series characters are given attributes that are corporately different form their earlier appearances and history. The frustration of the Star Wars Community is fuming. It is saddening to see a series\\, known for a emotional and thrilling story\\, fall apart because of a poorly formulated story that just did not make sense whatsoever.","true":true}
