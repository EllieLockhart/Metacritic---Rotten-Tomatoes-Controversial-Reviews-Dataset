Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has always been better in concept than in execution. Books & Video Games do a better job exploring the lore than 5\/8 saga movies. I feel like The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back that gives a refreshing story that raises moral questions and delves deep into the human aspects of this alien universe. I loved it very much and do not understand all the hate. I was so thankful that the plot did not revolve around the deathstar. I think years from now this movie will be looked on as a classic.","true":true}
