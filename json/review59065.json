You spend most of your time looting or watching cutscenes.

Nope\\, the story is incredibly boring and uninspiring. Clearly written by a different team to the first game.\r\rThe actual gameplay\\, and there isn't a great deal of it\\, is boring and sluggish. The controls just don't feel responsive. The combat isn't anything special and you're fighting mostly humans the whole game\\, and some undead too.\r\rThe only good thing to come out of this game I'd say\\, is that it's now been made extremely obvious how bias the shill media are. They want their early review copies for clicks and views\\, they want their trips out\\, they want their freebies. If it wasn't obvious before\\, it is now.\r\rFor me\\, The Last Of US's story ends after the first game. Don't waste your time and money on this one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
