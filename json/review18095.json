Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought episode 7 was a very good\\, solid foundation. I feel like nothing really happened in episode 8. It did not advance the characters or story in any meaningful way. I agree with Kinda Funny\u2019s review of the movie. ","true":true}
