Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes made without any common sense\\, like 45 mins of movie is wasted. \\and changing character of Luke to somebody who would turn on his apprentice just cause he felt something dark in him is just lame. I hoped for epic and heroic outro for these all time favourite characters. And Leia as Superman.... omg\\n\\nGiving it 3 stars just cause Im fanboy of SW universe. Otherwise I'm totally unhappy of how this episode went. You should have stick with JJ Abrams...","true":true}
