Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another Star Wars movie by Disney and once again they make us think the 2nd trilogy by George Lucas was incredibly exceptional compared to this. The duels in particular are as they were written by a 5 yo. New characters presumably weak or unskilled\\, can all of sudden do amazing things and close a game that doesn't seem to give half a chance to the bad guys. It has become a business like the one for the Transformers movies\\, built for selling more toys and gadgets rather than writing a proper sci-fi movie.","true":true}
