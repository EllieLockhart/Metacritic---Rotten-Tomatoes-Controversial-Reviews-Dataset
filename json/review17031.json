Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed it\\, for anyone who loves cinema and classic Samurai films this is a Star Wars you wanted.  I don't know what all the negative reviews are all about. many seem copy and pasted here.","true":true}
