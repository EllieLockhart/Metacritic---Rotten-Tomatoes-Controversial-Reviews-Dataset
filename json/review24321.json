Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Might have been a good sensible movie if it's standalone and is using new characters with little character development established previously. \\nHowever what it turns out is a spit on you and your Star Wars franchise loving face by taking loved and established characters through cringeworthy story arcs and completely subverting what they represented to make you scratch your head in confusion and revulsion by the end of the movie. \\nWith regards to placement in a trilogy\\, it does little to connect and flesh out the different arcs\/ characters established in the first movie. Worse it leaves you bereft with any interest in final trilogy movie. \\nStill I hope you enjoy it as it would mean your personal Star Wars experience would remain untainted\\, but sure was slightly ruined for me. I am going to wait for the non spoilers reviews for the Rise of Skywalker before buying my ticket!","true":true}
