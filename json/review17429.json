Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this on opening night and I have to say it is a fantastic execution on saving SW from the garbage J.J. Abrams gave us. If you are a fan of the creativity that was held in the old cannon and books\\, you will enjoy this masterpiece. Finally\\, we get an original story! I truly had A New Hope for the future of SW after watching this (until I found out J.J. is doing the next one) and will be watching it again in theaters soon.","true":true}
