Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the same old stuff\\, like was handled poorly.  The where lots of scenes that took me out of the movie (Leia anyone).  But my biggest problem is that it's just Empire and return of the Jedi smushed together. (The Casino Planet feels remenicant of Jabba's Palace)   Essentially these new movies made all the trouble the characters went through in the original trilogy pointless as the first Order is the Empire and the resisentence is the Rebellion (in fact it's flat said in the movie).  \\n\\nThere was so much pitentiol that could have been in this new trilogy\\, they could have taken inspiration from say ex soviet countries and their struggles once the Union fell or go back and look at what happened when Rome fell and see the problems the Jedi and a new republic could have. Instead we get a rehash of the same story just different names m=not good at all.","true":true}
