Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it. More than the force awakens. There where two or three jokes more than there should have been\\, but at least they made me smile. This is my first review and I did it only because this movie deserves better.","true":true}
