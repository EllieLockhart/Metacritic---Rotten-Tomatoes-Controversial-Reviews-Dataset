Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge star wars fan\\, this movie is bad. The force powers are way way over powered\\, (force chocking and slammimg from the other side of the galaxy)\\, not inline with the previous movies. Some characters story lines were a waste and they might as well have not been in the movie\\,(fin and the code master). Luke Skywalker was a grumpy old man that just moaned through most the movie. The only good parts of the movie are the space battles and the visual looks of all the different scenes and planets.","true":true}
