Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard\\, life-long fan\\, there are some choices made that I wasn't initially satisfied with. However\\, this was a bold and amazing film. It's a bit overstuffed at times\\, and the Finn\/Rose arc could have been cut in half if not eliminated\\, but there are more than enough moments that make you gasp and cheer.","true":true}
