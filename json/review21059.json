Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really impressed on how well this movie turned out. The color pallet was absolutely beautiful\\, but I wasn't impressed with how they made this movie a SJW recruitment film. That isn't what Star Wars is about\\, but with today's society we have so many groups that want to impose their views on others so I have to look past all that crap to see the story for what it is. I will say it is confusing on the direction of this film and where it is leading us. I do feel there was some unresolved issues from TFA and TLJ like for Rey's family which is still not clear as it doesn't convey the linage. Plus\\, how can you believe a word Kylo says?","true":true}
