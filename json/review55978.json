Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruins star wars.  Doesn't even feel like a star wars movie.  Whole movie could have been cut down to about 45 minutes.  A lot of time spent stalling on the ship\\, pretty much waiting for something to happen.  There is a whole quest for Finn and a new comer that is absolutely useless and leads to no plot development other than some relationship building ( which can be done while also developing the plot)  The characters end up right back in pretty much the same place and situation they had been in.  There are some very unsatisfying answers and conclusions to characters.  A main character dies\\, for seemingly no reason\\, after learning a great lesson\\, and no one mourns them.   Also\\, why is the first order so powerful\\, what's their background\\, as well as Smoke's?  The resistance has the power of the majority of republic at their back\\, yet they have NOTHING?  No one to come to their aid?  The damn rickety rebel alliance was stronger.","true":true}
