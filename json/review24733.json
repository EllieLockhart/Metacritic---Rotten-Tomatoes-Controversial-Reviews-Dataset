Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mr Johnson was obviously not qualified to lead this movie.  Read the \\\"expert\\\" reviews\\, and they really have nothing to say but toeing the party line.  To put this in software terms\\, this is not a shippable product.  Disappointment after disappointment\\, trying to replace the lead three characters with meh...and killed off...dialog..again\\, not a shippable product.","true":true}
