Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just when it looked like this movie was going to be salvaged by an unlikely partnership between Rey and Kylo it devolved further into nonsense and hubris. \\nIt was impossible to empathise with any of the characters\\, even the established ones. Luke's character made absolutely no sense in light of his optimist self from the originals. Leia's resurrection and flight were absolutely laughable. \\nThe casino sequence made no sense\\, Rose's character is cliched and Holdo is absolutely despicable\\, even in light of her sacrifice. The sacrifice would have been a lot more powerful coming from an established and beloved character like admiral Ackbar who instead gets the royal treatment of being blown into space as an afterthought to make room for these hollow new characters. That is pretty typical of this movie's treatment of everything we loved about the franchise. It walks in and tears everything down for what reason I know not.","true":true}
