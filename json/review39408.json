Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is simply terrible. Twists and turns are not always good. When you are traveling on a path and swerve off into a brick wall\\, killing most of the people in the vehicle with you\\, that's not a good thing. Some of the humor was off and at this level that is unacceptable. Pacing was off which again at this level is unacceptable. The story was pitiful\\, uninspired\\, and depressing. I completely reject Star Wars from Rian Johnson's point of view.","true":true}
