{"101487":169462,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\nGood Points: \\n1. Kylo Ren and Rey fight Scene\\n2. Luke having more lines than in Force Awakens\\n3. Yoda\\n4. Actresses and actors were excellent as always.\\n5. Luke - was awesome\\, end scene was good but not excellent.\\nBad Points\\n1. Worst Storyline Ever\\n2. Poe Saga was not interesting\\n3. Finn and Rose Saga was utterly crap and pointless\\n4. Princess Leia is suddenly able to master the force like an absolute boss and prevent herself from instantly dying in space - couldn't we have her take on Snoke or parent Kylo better? Especially since she now can use force slap. \\n5. Snoke was pointless - why bring him in if you're just going to finish him in the most unimpressive way possible?\\n6. Luke was and looked like a homeless fool with barely any power. and died from.. being too old to be able to use the force?!\\n7. No flow to this movie whatsoever \\n8. Not enough millennium falcon action\\n9. No training for Mary Sue!\\n10. No character development - I couldn't care less if any of the new characters died - I should not feel like this\\, I should be wanting them all to survive.\\n11. What the hell is the rest of the galaxy doing???\\n12. You killed off Luke :\/\\n13. Isn't Luke supposed to be insanely powerful by now? He wasn't even close to Anakin\\, let alone Yoda","true":true}
