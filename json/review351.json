Despite this\\, I urge everyone to try the game out and I'm willing to bet that if you like (or rather don't dislike) the concept you will enjoy this game\\, provided you're into horror games of course. It feels like a movie\\, in which you make the decisions. It's nice to have an experience like this once in a while.\r\rI played the game through with my friends during the weekend and the game wasn't that scary\\, to me at least. My friends said that it was somewhat scary\\, but not on the same level as Outlast\\, for example. Though we didn't use headphones or a surround home theater and obviously we had each others' company and support. Jump scares are something the game has a lot of though\\, especially in the beginning. I'd say there's even too much of them\\, although the game is supposed to pay homage to the old horror films with the cliches included. That is something you have to keep in mind while playing the game.\r\rUnfortunately the game has some pacing issues. Sometimes you walk around for a good while before anything happens. The occasionally awkward camera angles don't really help either. However this doesn't detract from the immersion and tension too much. The game makes up for its issues with great characters with marvelous voice acting\\, a tense atmosphere and an intriguing\\, if a bit predictable\\, plot. Also\\, don't let the QTE's scare you away. They are well done and keep you on the edge of your seat. The graphics are also good\\, but could be better on some parts. Animations can be a bit jerky and over-done at times\\, but all in all they are good.\r\rIf you are wondering whether your choices really have an effect in the game\\, let me assure you: they do. Tough choices and the intriguing plot really makes you want to keep on playing. I really enjoyed my time with the game and\\, despite its flaws\\, it is a must-play for horror fans. Also\\, Hayden Panettiere. 'Nuff said.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
