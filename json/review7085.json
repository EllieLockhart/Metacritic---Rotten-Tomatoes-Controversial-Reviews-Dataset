Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Embora seja um grande filme\\, o epis\u00f3dio 8 n\u00e3o est\u00e1 isolado da franquia\\, mas se desenvolve como se estivesse.\\nN\u00e3o possui coer\u00eancia com o enredo de seu antecessor e nem com a personalidade dos her\u00f3is j\u00e1 consagrados.
