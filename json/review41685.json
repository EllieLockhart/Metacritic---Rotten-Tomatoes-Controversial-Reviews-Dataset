Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is more original than its predecessor\\, but it holds the same disrespect for the OT cast.  If it bothered you that Han Solo abandoned his family and ran away to become a smuggler again when things got tough\\, this movie will turn you off even more by what it does with Luke Skywalker.  General Leia is pretty great\\, though.\\n\\nThe battles\\, effects\\, and visuals are\\, of course\\, top notch\\, and there's no shortage of excitement and emotional moments.  If Star Wars is just a series of popcorn flicks to you\\, you'll probably like this installment\\, but if it holds a special place for you\\, if the classic characters are important to you at all\\, you're going to find this one unsatisfying.","true":true}
