Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THE STAR WARS FRANCHISE.  30 YEARS OF CHARACTERS THAT'S FANS LOVE AND PAY FOR THEY ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TEAR THEM DOWN. IF THE OLD FANS ARE RAN OFF...WHO WILL BUY THEIR PRODUCTS OR GO TO SEE THEIR FILMS?  I SEE THE FUTURE BOX OFFICE SCORES DROPPING CONTINUALLY FROM THIS POINT ON.","true":true}
