The graphics\\, gameplay\\, and attention to detail are absolutely second to none. Unfortunately they are all held back by an extremely poorly conceived plot that is creating backlash due to false advertising.\r\rInitially this game was marketed as a continuation of the journeys and character growth for Ellie and Joel. This was done by manipulating existing scenes in trailers\\, etc. The reality is Joel dies two hours in\\, you then spend 8 hours hunting down his murderer and then 8 hours as his murderer in a interlacing 3 days before ultimately coming to the conclusion that an eye for an eye would leave us all blind and it is important to forgive and sparing said murderer. A thing many of us already understand.\r\rThe plot as a result comes across as extremely pretentious\\, preachy\\, and borderline misery porn as everything is slowly stripped away from the characters we came to love in The Last Of Us.\r\rWhich is a shame because the social justice elements were handled very tactfully for the most part\\, but will likely result in hindering the causes more than helping them.\r\rThe gameplay is a bit stale but still enjoyable as ever\\, little innovation is done regarding enemies however the improved ai and brutality make for a great improvement on the original.\r\rThat said at the end of the day this is a game that will likely leave you saying why did I bother spending money on this or even bother playing it? No amount of gameplay can ever make up for that. As a result I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
