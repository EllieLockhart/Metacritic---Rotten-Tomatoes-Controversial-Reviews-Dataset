Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good story answers some questions but leaves you with more to be answered. This film failed to leave me with any questions I yearn to be answered. The story was empty and the jokes are more miss than hit. Many of which won\u2019t be entertaining the second time around. Aside from a few great action set pieces the story and characters felt a bit flat. ","true":true}
