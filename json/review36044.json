Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi Subverts expectations and follows its own advice to \\\"let the past die.\\\" A mix of fan service and new direction\\, it moves at a snappy pace despite its running time. some pieces work better than others - a fetch-quest to a casino planet is probably the low point of the film\\, but  interactions between rey and kylo ren shine as perhaps some of the best star wars moments ever.","true":true}
