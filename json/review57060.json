Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film ruined star wars. I'm hoping for a reboot. I gave it one star for the awesome music and visuals. However plot-wise it is a disaster. They have taken those you look up to in star wars and made their characters pathetic and flawed. They have ruined several heroes and replaced them with nothing worth getting excited about. There are a bunch of other issues but ruining luke skywalker is pretty much unforgivable. Star wars is dead - I don't see how they can fix it without a reboot. I don't know if I'll be able to enjoy the originals now without trying to play mind games to forget what I've seen in this one. You can tell the director was not a true fan or else he would have never done this. I'm also shocked at Kathleen kennedy. She should have known better. A predictable film would have been better than this disrespectful mockery.","true":true}
