Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film challenges a lot of what people perceive Star Wars to be.  I enjoyed the film quite a bit\\, but it definitely upends a lot of accepted ideas.  I can see a lot of fans being uncomfortable with these stories which in many ways they feel like they own.  The best part in my mind is that is untethers future movies from a lot of the mysteries that in some ways weigh the story down.\\n\\nI'm definitely interested to see if my perception of the film changes over time.","true":true}
