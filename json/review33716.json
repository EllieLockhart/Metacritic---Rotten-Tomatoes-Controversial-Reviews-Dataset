Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. It is objectively flawed on multiple levels\\, from endless plot holes to side plots that get more screen time than the actual story. \\nSpeaking of which - there isn't really a cohesive story in the entire film\\, it can be described as a whole lot of nothing happens for the entire run time.","true":true}
