Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Pointless dialogue\\, zero storyline\\, bad directing and full of cringe. It made me question if this was even a serious film. Mindless\\, heartless\\, a mockery of Star Wars. If The Force Awakens wasn't enough of a sign\\, this one certainly is. It's like Star Wars got cancer.\\n\\nI'm actually going to rewatch the prequels to remind myself of a better follow up to the originals.","true":true}
