Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More destroyed legacy characters\\, more focus on non-characters created by Disney Lucasfilm in order to chase a new fanbase which doesn't exist\\, and ridiculous things like hyperspace ramming which break from canon and result in no Star Wars film ever making sense. Please complete Star Wars IX before moving all three pieces of terrible fan fiction to the non-canon Legends series were they belong. Thank you.","true":true}
