Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film\\, many of you have already detailed why so I don't need to repeat what's been said - but to make clear how disappointing this is for a Star Wars film this is the first (and hopefully only) time I have ever been motivated enough about a film to write an online review!","true":true}
