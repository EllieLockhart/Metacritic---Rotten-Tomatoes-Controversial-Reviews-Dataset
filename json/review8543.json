Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Impression: As a life-long Star Wars fan and someone who loved this movie the whole way through the first time\\, this review is a looooooong time coming. This is certainly not the movie most expect\\, but as long as one doesn't have very specific expectations going in\\, TLJ can be an amazing movie experience.\\n\\nReplay opinion: Still love it! There was bound to be a Star Wars film that would remain divisive to such a broad fan base\\, and even that weirdly adds to my long-term appreciation of the whole franchise. In fact\\, this movie informed my opinion of the other Star Wars films. A New Hope is #1 with TLJ tied for second with Empire. Just like Empire\\, TLJ builds on TFA's sense of discovery by contrasting it to gravity of greater stakes  and meaning. I expect that the challenge and ambiguity of this movie will payoff in a very satisfying conclusion in the next film. I love that I have so little idea what that might be!","true":true}
