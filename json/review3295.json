Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a star wars fan my whole life and I never thought I could stop being excited for it. Before seeing that movie I could have payed to watch any star wars opening credit\\, now I do not care for what comes next.","true":true}
