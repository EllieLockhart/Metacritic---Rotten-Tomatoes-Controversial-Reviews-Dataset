Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say about this movie that has not already been said? \\nI do understand the want to avoid becoming a carbon copy of The Empire Strikes back\\, but in trying to be different\\, this movie failed in every possible way (except the music and visuals: the movie DOES look quite good.)\\n\\navoiding spoilers\\, The plot was average at best\\, the new characters were unlikable\\, pointless\\, and needless. The treatment of pre-established characters and lore (namely Luke\\, Ackbar\\, and Leia) was downright disrespectful. \\n\\nAlso\\, it was politically charged with feminism and SJW propaganda\\, and the plot-lines that Were genuinely interesting from the force awakens were DROPPED like the bombs in the first act.\\n\\nI went into the movie EXPECTING disappointment\\, and i was STILL let down.","true":true}
