Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay I literally signed up for an account just to post a review about this movie so the rating would be lowered a fraction of a percent because that is how frustrating this movie is. \\n\\nYou can see by all the other negative reviews the reasons\\, I completely agree with all of the negative points. This was hands down the worst Star Wars movie ever made and I attribute that to Rian Johnson's addition to the team.  Why they added a new director to the mix who has done next to nothing reputable in the middle of a trilogy and at that arguably the top trilogy of all time is beyond me. It is almost as though they are purposefully ruining the franchise. \\n\\nIt will be worth your time and money to just wait until this comes out on Netflix if you so desperately want to keep up with the series. Better luck on the next movie.","true":true}
