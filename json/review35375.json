Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi excels in all the areas where it\u2019s recent predecessors struggled: strong characters\\, \u201cthinker\u201d moments\\, unforeseen plot twists\\, and above all a willingness to take risks and expand Star Wars past simple lightsaber battles and derivative plots salvaged from prior movies. Recommend for all Star Wars fans and for others looking to delve a little deeper into what makes the Star Wars universe such a timeless sci-fi adventure.","true":true}
