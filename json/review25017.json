Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My review of this movie would be much different had Rian Johnson not directed this film. My biggest problem with this movie\\, aside from the plot being all over the place\\, is the sheer amount of useless content that does not change the outcome of the story. This is the longest Star Wars movie yet and at least 30 minutes of it is just useless content that does not change a thing. I'm sure if JJ Abrams directed this one like The Force Awakens\\, it'd have gone much better.","true":true}
