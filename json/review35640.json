Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an action packed movie. Just when you think the movie will end\\, it comes back to life (3 times). The movie is good\\, however the character of Rey didn\u0092t develop enough. Finn was not developed either. The movie couldn\u0092t decide who was going to be the main protagonist. I was very disappointed that the latest Star Wars decided to kill the prior iconic heroes. Perhaps it\u0092s Disney sticking its thumb at Lucasfilms.","true":true}
