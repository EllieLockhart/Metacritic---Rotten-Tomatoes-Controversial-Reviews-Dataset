Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian just crapped all on the memory of Star Wars characters and lore\\, the only thing that was done well was visuals. The story is complete crap\\, you will have no feelings or care for any of the characters. It sucks\\, there is no reason to watch the next movie.","true":true}
