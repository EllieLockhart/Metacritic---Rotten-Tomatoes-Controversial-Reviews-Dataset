Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson gives a refreshing take on a franchise that's hard-pressed for new elements after being in the spotlight since 1977. The film brings a few interesting spins on the Star Wars universe\\, but remains rooted in the classic pieces of the saga. Throw in a couple of genuinely unexpected moments and you've got a fun\\, visually stunning\\, and intense movie that stands tall to its predecessors. Don't believe the low-star reviews; if you enjoy Star Wars\\, you'll definitely enjoy The Last Jedi.","true":true}
