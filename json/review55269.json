Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is a nihilistic\\, deconstructive postmodernist crap to deconstruct star wars! I say lets deconstruct Disney\\, starting with our wallets! Disney is truly the Empire\\, the dark side\\, and is pushing to lure us all into it! It tries to create a new morale (a corrupted one) by destroying everything u knew\\, u loved\\, u cherished\\, all moral codes\\, religion\\, tradition\\, burning ancient books\\, eradicating all you believe in and bringing and imposing their new believes\\, their new religion! Brain washing at its highest level! No effort is required anymore\\, no studying\\, no sacrifice\\, no work at all... everything should be given to us just because... we deserve everything just because... U can become the most powerful jedi in the universe by just closing ur yes\\, taking a deep breath... and thats it! A political travesty\\, a dystopia where there is no good and evil\\, and all your values are thrown to the recycle bin! Be very careful with this movie... is poison\\, dont expose ur children to this sjw communist postmodern orwellian dystopic garbage... and it killed Star Wars at its core and all that it once meant! Dont watch it\\, just download it if u have to! Disney.... Im done with u for good! \\\"From now on\\, we are enemies!\\\" (A.Salieri)","true":true}
