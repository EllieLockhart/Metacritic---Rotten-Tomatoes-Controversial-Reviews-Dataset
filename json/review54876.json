Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an impossible task\\, making a movie for the nit-pickiest audience in all of film\\, but Rian Johnson and co. really missed the mark here.\\n\\nTrying so hard to dodge all fan predictions before the film released led to some twists and reveals that were plain boring and disappointing. Of course\\, had some of the predictions that fans made turned out to be true\\, it might have been construed as \\\"fan service\\\" or \\\"pandering\\,\\\" but it certainly would have been a whole lot better than the movie we ended up getting.\\n\\nStory aside\\, it's a visually impressive movie (No surprise there\\, I guess.) The space sequences are some of the most memorable in the franchise. The Climactic Lightsaber battle sees a bit of a modification in this episode.\\n\\nThe movie is needlessly long. There's a story line involving finn and new character\\, rose\\, that makes you wish both had died before the credits rolled. (Which may sound harsh\\, but just watch the movie.)\\n\\nIn the end\\, this movie is at least better than \\\"Phantom\\\" and \\\"Clones\\,\\\" but that's it.","true":true}
