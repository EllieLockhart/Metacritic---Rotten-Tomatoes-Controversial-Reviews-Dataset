Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good solid movie but not a great one. It's a good follow on to Episode 7 \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". My major complaint with \\\"Last Jedi\\\"\\, and \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\,  is the casting of the villain. He's too dorky looking to be a villain.","true":true}
