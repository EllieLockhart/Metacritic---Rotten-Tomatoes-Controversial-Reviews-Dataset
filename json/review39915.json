Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, by far\\, the worst star wars movie i have ever seen. Not because of the actors involved. They did was they were told to do and they did it very well. This MOVIE is bad because the script doesn't make any SENSE\\, star wars wise. One of may FAVORITE movie CHARACTERS off al\\, time is luke skywalker. He was MURDERED in all thinkable ways by the film director\\, who was also one of the script writers\\, Rian Johnson. What he did to luke skywalker\\, scriptwise\\, is complete nonsense. There are other many problems with the script of this MOVIE but i will not go into more details. It is already bad as it is. I have no expectations to see episode 9 after this tragedy.","true":true}
