Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original Star Wars trilogy had a coherent cosmic message:  The Force was a revered and binary entity.  To hate evil doers\\, ironically\\, was to turn to the dark side and become evil.  The force could be employed to move inanimate objects\\, to enlighten or to anticipate present and future events.   Now\\, it seems\\, the force has dissolved into a metaphysical mystery wrapped in a cosmic enigma.   With the loss of an coherence\\, the Force is attributed to\\, well\\, just about anything.  Dead people infuse living people from millions of miles away.  Live people make dead people alive and then die for some unknown reason.   Anyway\\, ForceConfuson  makes for a lot of confusing and unexplained scenes that leave one nodding their head in a \u2018knowing' sort of way\\, not because they know what is actually happening (am not sure the director even knows) but bc claiming to understand that which is not understandable is so very chic.","true":true}
