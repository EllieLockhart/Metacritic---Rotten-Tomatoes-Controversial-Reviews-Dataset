Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Una increible pelicula (aunque los fans no lo puedan entender) con grandes momentos\\, una narrativa increible\\, y un aire distinto a todo lo antes visto en Star Wars\\, sin duda alguna una obra incomprendida\\, dios quiera que el tiempo la trate como se merece","true":false}
