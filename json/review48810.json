Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst of the 9 core. Better than Solo. I'd watch the Christmas special 100 times before watching this again. That said\\, Knives Out is great\\, so just keep Rian Johnson away from Star Wars and good things happen.","true":true}
