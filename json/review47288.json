Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible loss... the whole Star Was universe kidnapped by femi-nazis. The movie is full of feminist hate toward male-created values.\\nThe story is a multiple plagiarism consisting of mix of ideas and scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. Clumsily told and heavily affected by male-phobic creative decision.","true":true}
