Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't mind disposing of elements of the past movies\\, don't mind a few plot holes. But this film\\, good grief. It's riddled with plot holes that took me out the movie. It doesn't give any pay off in terms of explanations or sense of resolution and I found myself gazing at my watch and hoping it would end.\\n\\nI've still got no idea about who the first order are\\, how they came to be\\, have no idea about many of the main characters. And...I could go on forever. Frankly I have no idea how they'll be able to do the next film. What's left? What a terrible shame.","true":true}
