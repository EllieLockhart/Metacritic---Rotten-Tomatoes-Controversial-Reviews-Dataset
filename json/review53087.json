{"101487":106074,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A story that is terribly written\\, full of inconsistencies\\, plot holes. There is also an abundance lack of connectivity with anything that does happen in the film. You can also throw in pointless side characters that add nothing. In fact calling them \\\"characters\\\" is an overstatement. There are so many unbelievable and dumb moments in this film. Like why can Leia suddenly fly in space\\, why does Finn and Rose go to space Las Vegas for an hour and accomplish nothing and return with nothing and add nothing to the story. I guess they saved an animal....Oh and back to characters\\, most have no ark in this film. That in itself is bad. The ones that do have an ark are very poorly done. Talking about Rey and Kylo here. Now for Luke Skywalker. They makers of this film treated his character with such disrespect. They also destroy so many story elements to the point of making a sequel to this to be all but guaranteed to fail. It also goes out of its way to ruin many things from previous star wars films. There is also a style of comedy in this movie that every time there was a buildup of serious drama\\, it would be undercut by a (unfunny and shit) joke. All in all\\, a tremendous failure.\\nP.S. yoda shows up as states \\\"the best teacher failure is\\\" \\, so maybe they can learn from this mistake?? unlikely though because its disney.","true":true}
