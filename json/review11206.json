Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I don't think the critics watched the same movie as me.  This movie was so cornball its laughable.  It has some of the worst moments in Star Wars history.  It also has an endless parade of pointless cute aliens that look like they were extras in 'The Dark Crystal' or 'Never Ending Story'.  I guess they were added to sell toys.  Its not all bad.  It has some cool moments\\, but best ever Star Wars deserving 5 stars? Hell no...","true":true}
