Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I saw the original Star Wars as a young boy and carry some strong nostalgia for those first films\\, I've never been a fanatical fan. That said\\, the way Disney has destroyed beloved characters and mythology is cringe worthy. I feel terribly for the fans and especially Mark Hamill\\, who is clearly devastated that his legacy as Luke Skywalker has been reduced to a steaming pile of humiliation. Beyond the vile disrespect toward past icons\\, the film is simply awful ... with insane plot holes\\, absurd characters who are impossible to like and\/or care about\\, and nonsensical twists on the Star Wars mythology that retroactively destroy the entire franchise. This movie is an epic fail.","true":true}
