Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it one full star for the good visuals and decent sound design. It had a few good moments\\, but as a whole it was a narrative mess that completely s**t on the story of Star Wars. The Last Jedi doubled down on The Force Awakens's faults\\, ignored or corrupted some of its plot points\\, and generally flipped the middle finger to the legacy of the original trilogy. What they did to Luke Skywalker is pretty much unforgivable. Any hope Rey had of becoming a good character was dashed\\, and Finn and Poe were effectively wasted. And the new character Rose is worse than Jar Jar as far as I am concerned.\\n\\nThe one light of hope was a plot point connecting Kylo and Rey\\, but it is totally wasted and ruined by the end. But hey\\, at least we got to see Luke slap Rey with a grass reed...\\n\\nThis movie broke Star Wars.","true":true}
