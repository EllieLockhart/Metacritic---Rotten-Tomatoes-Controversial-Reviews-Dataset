Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, maybe there are some pacing issues and maybe there are some unnecessary plots but this movie is no where near one or two star level. With Rian Johnson\u2019s direction and great performances the movie is very entertaining and has a great final act.","true":true}
