Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say it was one one of the worst endings to a SW movie I've ever seen. Leia somehow using the force? Luke playing a grumpy old man and then disappearing was terrible. I see no light at the end of the tunnel and really don't know where JJ is gonna go with episode IX.","true":true}
