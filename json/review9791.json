Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great acting\\, Beautifully shot\\, but by far the worst of the SW movies. This movie\\, makes it so that there is no reason you should want to see episode 9. SPOILERS! All major villains are dead. Snoke dead\\, Phasma dead. Kylo Ren\\, not dead\\, but has already lost in both movies. So what are you expecting to happen in the final one. And even if all the above somehow come back to life and are EPIC AND POWERFUL\\, They will just lose. So its biggest sin without writing 100 paragraphs is that it ruined Episode 9.","true":true}
