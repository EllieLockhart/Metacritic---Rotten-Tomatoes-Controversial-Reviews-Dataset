Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi destroys almost everything J.J. Abrams brought to the table with Episode 7 while simultaneously offering nothing of value to fans of the original series and new fans alike. \\nThe air of mystery worked into The Force Awakens is now long gone. Those expecting the plot lines of the first film to evolve and grow will be disappointed\\, as this film is more concerned with surprising you than telling a story that is satisfying. \\n\\nSeveral characters' motivations make no sense and often contradict their previous behavior. The movie's story feels like a subplot rather than the next chapter of a grand story. \\n\\nThere were so many interesting directions this film could have gone\\, yet it goes nowhere and feels oddly conclusive for the middle film in a trilogy. There are points in this film where you will laugh at the absurdity of what you are watching. If that isn't a sign that something's wrong here\\, I don't know what is. \\n\\nWhat makes this even more painful is that this was Disney's one and only chance at concluding Luke and Leia's stories in a satisfying and meaningful way. They have utterly failed at doing so.\\nRian Johnson has not only ruined this film\\, but in doing so has severely weakened its predecessor as well as possibilities for its sequel. \\n\\nUnfortunately it seems that the world will have to continue to wait for a second great Star Wars trilogy.","true":true}
