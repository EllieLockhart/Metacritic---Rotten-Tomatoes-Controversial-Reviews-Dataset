Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed with the Last Jedi.  All of the build up and mystery regarding who Rey and Snoke were was just tossed aside for a disappointing answer. I won't give anything away\\, but the whole movie had several disappointing moments and focused on too many characters to keep the plot easy to follow.","true":true}
