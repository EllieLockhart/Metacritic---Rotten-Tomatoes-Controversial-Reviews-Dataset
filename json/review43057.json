Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was well acted and tried the best to stay away of the monotony of the old Master-Padawan story. Sounds like fans were looking for a kicking ass Skywalker like the novel extensions? Mark Hamill is old so it was time to passed the torch to the new characters so get over it. What he did in the movie was fantastic. ","true":true}
