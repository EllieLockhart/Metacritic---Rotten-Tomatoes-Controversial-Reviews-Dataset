Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a good movie. Despite all of the fan outrage over the choices that are made\\, this movie is not a good movie. If I had to come up with two words to describe this movie\\, I would say Anti-climactic under-utilization.\\n\\nFor some reason\\, this movie thinks it's being \\\"different\\\" and \\\"edgy\\\" by poorly telling a story. Plain and simple\\, we don't care about any of the characters. \\n\\nThe new characters introduced in this movie are BORING!! I cannot stress this enough. The are given so little development\\, that I was consistently asking myself why they were in the film? The offshoot story of this movie with Finn and Rose is so unnecessarily painful to get through\\, it completely bogs down the pacing.\\n\\nIf we want to care about a characters death\\, we have to actually no why we should\\, other than \\\"they're evil urghhh\\\"","true":true}
