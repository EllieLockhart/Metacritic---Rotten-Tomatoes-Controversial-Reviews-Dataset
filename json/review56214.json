Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is often seen as the shinning jewel in the sci-fi film genre. Sure the saga has had some missteps with the first\\, two films in the prequel trilogy. The Last Jedi\\, is truly the pinnacle terrible script writing and directing. Rian Johnson\\, has killed this franchise. His directing and writing skills have destroyed this film. The film is eye candy for sure. But it boils down to nothing less than a movie you can turn you brain off to watch. This is a terrible Star Wars film\\, but a mediocre action film you can turn your brain off too. I hope Disney do the right thing and get this god awful director away from this dying franchise.","true":true}
