Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Disney: the Last Jedi was a poor film. Poorly written and a strained film.  Instead of listening to film critics who are paid by studios\\, listen to the majority of the fans who didn't like the film. Fan rating on rotten tomatoes is 48%. That is worse than a Phantom menace.    And in a recent interview Mark Hamill agreed that the vision of Colin Treverrow was better:\\n\\n\\\"I had discussions with Colin. I was very excited because we were on the same page in terms of where we wanted to go and how we wanted to see Luke in a way that we never seen him. Even in this current version. But I don't know what went on. I don't want to know because there is no upside to that story. I like all those people.\\\"","true":true}
