Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Besides some amazing visuals and a lightsaber battle that was actually pretty cool\\, this movie was a pretty big let down. \\nI won't recycle mass complaints here.

These characters are not going anywhere and the arcs and growth from characters in the original trilogy have been thrown out the window. \\nTrying to keep up with marvel humor and sell merchandise. The movie for all its fuzzy creatures and somebody's weird nanny\/ Star Wars alien fantasy felt very present in a galaxy we know all too well.\\nTLJ failed to learn the lesson of the prequels and the remastered nonsense ruining the original trilogy: Compelling characters and the struggle between the dark and the light are what make the far\\, far away galaxy so beloved- not the other way around.","true":true}
