Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of time and money !! Wrost Star Wars movie ever ! It was a long long two hours and half . So many plot holes and so many unnecessary characters \\\"Finn and rose\\\" the casino scene which was so stupid !!!","true":true}
