Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve read so many bad reviews on this movie\\, so I went in not planning on being impressed. I\u2019m not sure we are talking about the same movie. Star Wars right? What a great movie. I was not disappointed at all. It was a great ride all the way through. Sure\\, there were a few silly things\\, and some other things that were a little off topic\\, but overall it was well worth the price of admission. ","true":true}
