Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars I have ever seen. Great actors\\, great cgi\\, ok fight cheography\\, but a crappy plot\\, and terrible battle strategy. Praise Mark Hamill for being on the big screen again. I feel like the critics are being paid by Disney to give it a good review. George Lucas... should have sold your star wars to Fox.","true":true}
