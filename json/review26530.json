Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OG Star Wars fanboy here\\, born with the first film in 1977.  My first memory is seeing Empire in the theater on my 3rd birthday. And I also have read much of what many consider to be \\\"canon\\\" novels in the series\\, and especially loved the first new canon trilogy focused on Thrawn.  I loved this movie. It was irreverant\\, threw much of the \\\"taking itself too seriously\\\" ilk out\\, and brought the audience more surprises\\, feints\\, and shear sci-fi action and humor than I was expecting.  Derivative? Hardly. It more likely burned down the self-importance of many self proclaimed Star Wars experts\\, like so many sacred Jedi texts.  Well done.  I can't wait for the trilogy finale\\, now that we are unburdened of the weight of the past!","true":true}
