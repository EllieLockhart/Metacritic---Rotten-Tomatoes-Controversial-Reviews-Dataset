Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have ever been curious about what the full potential of the Force could be\\, this satisfies that curiosity ten-fold! I'm not sure how much better you could have made this movie. It buttons-up a lot of plot points from even Return of the Jedi and then comes full force with some of the most epic sequences I've ever seen in movie history (and I'm comparing to Deathly Hallows Part II). \\n\\nI left the theatre fulfilled and excited\\, which is what I want from a sci-fi action saga like the one I grew up watching. It was epic!","true":true}
