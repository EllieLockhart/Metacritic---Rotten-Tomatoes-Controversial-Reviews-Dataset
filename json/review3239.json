Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful movie. It's a very different take on Star Wars. Does some things with vital characters that many will take issue with\\, but I thought were creative and were a natural fit to the story. I had 1 major issue with Luke Skywalker in the final scenes of the movie just because of how it impacts episode 9 and what his arc could have been if not for what happens in that scene. Love the Kylo Ren and Rey story arc. Overall a great Star Wars movie. Top 4 for me. Maybe even higher after I live with it a little longer. ","true":true}
