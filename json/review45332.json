Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly awful movie!   Literally hundreds of videos on YouTube explaining and analysing the many reasons why  they majorly fucked up not only the movie but also the whole saga !  It saves me having to do it here myself...\\nmy only regret is that I didn't save my own money\/time watching this mess of a movie and utter betrayal of Star Wars.\\nDisney has officially killed the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
