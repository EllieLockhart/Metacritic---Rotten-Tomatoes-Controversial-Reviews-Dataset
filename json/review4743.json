Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely disrespectful to Luke's character. Completely undid everything Abrams setup. Men are space Nazis and weak. Only women\\, aliens\\, and people with purple hair (you know who I mean) can save the day. Plot holes galore. The visuals were good and Yoda was amazing. I want my money back!","true":true}
