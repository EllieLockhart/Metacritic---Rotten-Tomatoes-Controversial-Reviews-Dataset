Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has the \\\"uniform\\\" of a Star Wars movie but not the heart or soul.\\nThis film was made purely to generate money in the same way that a fast food chain does\\, appeal to the senses but not the brain\\, Star Wars porn but worse. \\nIt disregards the gravitas of the concepts created within the Star Wars galaxy (ie human natures eternal struggle with good vs evil and the respect of intellectualism vs primal fears) and character development of the last 30-40 yrs which is the real travesty of this film.\\nThose desperate for a quick fix will tell themselves this is a good movie. Those of us who understand the fundamentally flawed and betrayed opportunity this was will not.\\nTerrible.","true":true}
