Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was my favorite movie of 2017 with no doubt. With talented director Rian Johnson and the affiliation of Disney\\, it was no doubt that the movie was going to be a smash hit for all audiences. I very much enjoyed the balance of humor\\, nostalgia\\, and action. The movie can be enjoyed by avid Star Wars superfans\\, and even people that haven't seen any of the movies. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of new actors that I haven't seen before (except for the movie preceding The Last Jedi). Those actors hat I wasn't familiar with were Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver\\, John Boyega\\, Domhnall Gleeson\\, and Kelly Marie Tran. The return of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (1956-2016) were also great crowd pleasers\\, especially to the hardcore Star Wars fans. \\n\\nThe story was very intriguing and the end shows that there needs to be another movie to tie up loose plot ends\\, and continue the normal trilogy format of the movies. The main idea of the movie is that the first order are the antagonists\\, and are trying to slay the jedi. The jedi is a religion that people follow\\, and some followers get the power of the force\\, the strongest ability in the galaxy. When the jedi are destroyed\\, all hope is lost for the resistance\\, which are the protagonists. The last jedi is Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)\\, and he begins to train Rey (Daisy Ridley) to be a jedi. The movie goes in depth on the past of almost all of the main characters in the story. The flashbacks tell the hardships and tell why the characters are on the side that they are\\, and it brings a very nice balance to the movie. The large scale battles throughout the movie are absolutely amazing. They show how large the struggle is\\, and how well done the cinematography is. As there are many good parts\\, there are a few that I do not like very much. There were some moments that do not fit the lore\\, such as Leia using the force. There was also a new character that I did not like very much. Rose is a member of the resistance whose sister died while fighting the first order in a space battle. She is a very whiny and a character that is not needed to help the plot. The characters that favored the first order\\, however\\, were great. That movie showed that they were just not horrible villains\\, but humans that even had mercy and morals. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)\\, on the other hand\\, had no morals\\, and no mercy for the resistance\\, especially Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker trained Kylo when he was a child\\, but saw the darkness within him. When Luke knew that Kylo\/Ben Solo's evil would bring darkness to the galaxy\\, Luke tried to assassinate him. Luke failed\\, and Kylo led on to lead the first order and bring havoc to the galaxy. The relationship between Kylo and Luke is a very interesting one that was revealed over the course of the film. The ending is very good\\, when an outnumbered resistance escapes the reaches of the first order after a huge battle and the first order being on their tail throughout the entire movie. There were a few characters that I wished had more screen time\\, but it didn't alter my movie experience at all.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, Star War: The Last Jedi is an adventure filled with large battles\\, interesting backstory\\, and lovable characters. I 10\/10 recommend you watch this movie\\, for it suits all ages. I was very happy with this movie\\, and hope to be even happier with the final movie.","true":true}
