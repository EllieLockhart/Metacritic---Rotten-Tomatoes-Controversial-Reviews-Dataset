Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was filled with excitement\\, twists\\, and the Force. The movie definitely went in a different direction than what was expected which was nice to see. Luke showed that even he can be consumed by the Dark Side and that he is very strong with the Force. The movie also showed how the Saga is changing and evolving. There is Light and Dark in everyone and working to keep the balance. The Last Jedi's message can apply to our every day lives. It was beautifully made and written. To those who hate this movie\\, I pity you. And to those supposed Star Wars 'fans' who hate this movie\\, how dare you call yourself a fan! You have these ridiculous expectations and when they don't go the way you want you get all bent out of shape. What's even more irritating is people are calling for George Lucas to take over but you ripped him apart for episodes 1-3. No matter what anyone does\\, there will be people and fans who will disagree and dislike what was completed. Just enjoy the movie for what it is- an epic Star Wars film! ","true":true}
