Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like I was watching two separate movies. One which involved Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo was deep and had some good character development. The other. which had the rebels vs the empire\\, was a huge let down. There was no character growth of the newer characters of Fin or Poe\\, and I never gained any sort of sympathy for the newest addition to the cast\\, Rose. In fact\\, their story arches went absolutely nowhere. If the character isn't a force user\\, there really ins't much of a change of status for them. To further bring down the score\\, the movie if filled with bad one liners\\, an over abundance of cheeky humor\\, and major let downs from the cliff hangers from Ep 7.  Underwhelming is the best word I can use to sum up.","true":true}
