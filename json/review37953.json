Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The series has taken a different turn for sure\\, and I don\u2019t really agree with the way it has been turned. Filled with unnecessary (and thin) characters\\, The Last Jedi sets the series in a new direction that definitely comes with plot holes and space to be filled. The film was entertaining to a fault\\, but at this point\\, I feel as if I\u2019m passing it because of the status is Star Wars itself. Rey and Finn both are flat characters and Rose was an unnecessary addition. Poe and Kylo Ren come into their characters more\\, but at the expense of some crazy and questionable plot twists. It\u2019s unfortunate the series has gone the way it has\\, but the Star Wars memory will always be there","true":true}
