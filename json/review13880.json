Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a dedicated Star Wars fan who is interested in the bigger picture and story of Star Wars\\, this movie will piss you off. If you're a non fan or you're knowledge of Star Wars starts and ends with The Force Awakens you'll probably find little to know faults with this movie. This movie is terrible on so many levels it's hard to pack them into a paragraph. Disney needs to think very hard about where they will go from here. I am nervous for what the future of my favorite movies series' future after watching this movie.","true":true}
