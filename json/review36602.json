Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a big sloppy mess.  Through the course of The Last Jedi\\, the slate is cleaned where the only serious villain cannot be taken seriously and that heroine has been written in such a ridiculous way that the movie franchise is left floundering.  I thought Anakin was supposed to be the one\\, but without any training\\, Rey is outrageously skilled and will far surpass him.  Snoke and Luke were the only characters that had the ability to ballast the SW ship\\, but they were jettisoned in such a way that it seems SW7 never existed..  Now all that remains is Rey and Kylo Ren who sit atop the capsized husk of what was a great story.  In Science Fiction or Fantasy\\, a core tenet is to stay true to the world-crafting that has already been developed.  If hyper-spacing through a ship is a permissible option\\, then SW4 and SW6 could have been much shorter if they would have done something similar.  Despite the flaws in SW 1-3\\, they passed muster because they had the same writer as SW 4-6.  Johnson wrote a decent story but one that disregarded what came before it\\, and SW 8 serves as a wrecking ball to the Star Wars world.  Instead of drawing upon the stories before it\\, Johnson decided to recreate the Star Wars universe in his own image.","true":true}
