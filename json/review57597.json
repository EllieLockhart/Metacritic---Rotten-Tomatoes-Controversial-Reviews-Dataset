Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ isn't the complete catastrophe that many are making it out to be\\, however\\, I was disappointed with quite a few things and this will probably be the first Star Wars movie that I will not pay to see again and may not even buy when it comes out on DVD. From the bad jokes\\, Marvel comic Leia\\, the pointless side plot adventure of Finn and Rose that accomplished nothing except to serve as a vehicle for unnecessary social commentary\\, and the way that seemingly major characters like Snoke and Phasma were killed off without any development\\, this movie really failed in many ways. Its disconcerting that these story ideas gained approval from Kathleen Kennedy and the other caretakers of Star Wars. Hopefully the Episode 9 story will make some sense out of all this. \\n\\nIt wasn't all bad though. I do get that this trilogy is all about the passing of the torch to a new generation. I am fine with that and understand that this was inevitable if the story of Star Wars was to keep going on the big screen beyond RotJ. I did like the final few scenes\\, especially the apparently force-sensitive slave kid who was playing with his homemade Luke Skywalker action figure. That showed that\\, while our childhood heroes have now been put out to pasture with endings that are much less than they deserve\\, Han\\, Luke\\, and Leia will be remembered and revered within the Star Wars universe and their legends will have influence for generations to come.\\n\\nOh and RIP Admiral Ackbar. If anyone was going to kamikaze a starship into the enemy fleet to save everyone else\\, it should have been you.","true":true}
