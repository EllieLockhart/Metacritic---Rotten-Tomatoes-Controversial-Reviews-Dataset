Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is truly a visual spectacle\\, and yet the the only scene which I enjoyed was Frank Oz's nostalgic Yoda appearance. The rest of the movie was one long drawn out non-stop and nonsensical series of events which made mehope that the characters would die off as you can't identify with a single one. Where the original films are about friendship\\, betrayal and reconciliation\\, this movie was a showcase of special effects without any heart. A bad Star Wars and an terrible movie.","true":true}
