Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While die hard fans with high expectations will likely experience their first viewing of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" with harsh disappointment\\, I truly believe in time it will be looked as one of the most pivotal and sophisticated films in the Star Wars Saga. Rain Johnson has subverted the formula we've come to know with bold storytelling choices\\, dramatic weight\\, and seismic shifts of expectation - which to me\\, sounds like a pretty great Star Wars movie.","true":true}
