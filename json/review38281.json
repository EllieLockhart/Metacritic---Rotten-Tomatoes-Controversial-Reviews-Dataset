Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The word anticlimactic could describe this movie in one word. The movie is called last Jedi\\, but Luke then declares he is not the last Jedi!? I still think that there wasn't enough time to get to know the characters. There were some good action scenes which saves it from 1 star. But overall it felt rushed and the audience doesn't connect with characters anywhere near how they did in episodes 4-6 or 1-3","true":true}
