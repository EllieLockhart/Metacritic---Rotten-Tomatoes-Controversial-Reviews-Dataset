Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lack of story for new characters that you end up not caring about and a waste of a Snoke villain. Good fight scenes but one of the bottom movies in the series.","true":true}
