Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the best movie of the entire franchise. Rian Johnson kept surprising us as the plots remained unpredictable throughout. There are number of characters who will probably have spin off sagas and add to the dimensions of the Star Wars franchise. The franchise has been given a rebirth and I foresee this being the pinnacle of taking Star Wars to new heights. And the best part of the movie was how they paid homage to Carrie Fisher. She is a legend and each scene with her was directed to perfection. A new generation of Star Wars heroes and villains has been born.","true":true}
