Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably one if the least faithful to the series movies. This does not necessarily mean it's bad\\, however I dont believe that something needs to be changed unless you're going to do it better than the originals.\\n\\nI felt the movie never struck the right balance between silly in a childish way\\, action and excitement. The pacing was frankly kind of weird (see the addition of fuel into the saga so they could have a very slow chase)\\, during which Poe and Rose go to a casino planet so they can deepen their relationship from non-existant to two dimensional while tacking in some pretty hollow moral values.\\n\\nThe Luke character come out of retirement to drink some bird milk (seriously) and anguish over some pretty weak moral dilemmas. I wish i could give it credit for a fresh and invigorating take on the existing series but the storyline was weak\\, the plot devices contrived and the acting was frankly not as good as 7\\, which I'll put back into the poor dialogue and almost slap stick level of childish comedy.\\n\\nOverall a very poor movie.","true":true}
