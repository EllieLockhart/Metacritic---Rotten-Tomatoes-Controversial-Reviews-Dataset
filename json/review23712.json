Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Milking a creature\\, bad guys telling jokes\\, kill a central villain quickly without explaining his motivation.  Add to that\\, scenes that go nowhere (codebreaker).  Big middle fingers to JJ Abrams from Rian Johnson.  Finn\\, interesting character\\, nah\\, we'll just have you do run around stuff that doesn't matter.  Force\\, the light\\, the dark\\,\\,\\,\\,ah forget all of that\\, you can flip flop at will and it is no big deal.  Go a different way fine\\, do it in an offshoot\\, or with the next trilogy.  Complete the 9 movie epic.  For all those giving a pass because it is for \\\"a new generation\\\"\\, then you should be able to give the same pass to the prequels 1\\, 2\\, 3 for the same reason.  This is critics sucking up to Disney and wanting to go along to get along because they need to be popular.  (Apple phones vs Android). \\n\\nWatch overall ticket sales (not money) as this will show the repeat buys are not there.  I am a Star Wars Junkie.  I'm not dressing up for these movies\\, but I am a huge fan and saw the last one 5 times in the theater.  (10 tix) myself & wife.  \\nThis will be 1 showing\\, 2 tix.  80% drop from me alone.","true":true}
