Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars movie made thus far. So much terrible\\, try-hard\\, humor that is completely uncharacteristic of the Star Wars franchise. The plot jumps all over the place with MANY happenings left unexplained about about 30 plot holes I can think of off the top of my head. I have been a huge Star Wars fan my entire life\\, and I actually considered walking out because it was that terrible. This movie accomplished pretty much nothing\\, and it's apparent that Disney wants to make as many \\\"cute\\\" sellable creatures for marketing and money purposes. The new creatures look more like something from a fairy princess movie than Star Wars. Lastly\\, Kylo Ren has proven himself to be a very weak villain\\, and I don't see how it's possible the next movie will be any good with such a weak\\, emotionally-driven villain. I know most Star Wars fans will see it\\, as I did\\, with low expectations to begin with\\, but WOW believe me when I say\\, you cannot set your expectations low enough. This movie is a hot pile of trash.","true":true}
