Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"George Lucas did a amazing job long ago with a limited budget because he is brilliant. Disney is doing a very poor job unfortunately for millions of fans... I had hope for Episode 8 to be better than Episode 7 but it was worse. Many plot holes. Bad humor... how can you make Star Wars cheesy and corny?!!? Humor in Star Wars was great (Han Solo)...\\nForced diversified cast. I have nothing against it\\, it just feel forced which is sad. Characters lack to be interesting.\\nBest part of this movie was the Asian woman that did a good job. Those movies are very bad compare to the initial trilogy where we had amazing plot and lot of great characters. I do not have any hope for Episode 9. Perhaps more stories like Rogue One and Han Solo will provide good content to fans.","true":true}
