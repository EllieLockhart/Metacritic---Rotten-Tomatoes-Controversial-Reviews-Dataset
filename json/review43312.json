Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great film\\, definitely worth a watch. I can't fathom why people seem to dislike it so much here on rt. You'll notice everyone claiming a bunch of plot holes but not furthering their argument. I'm willing to hear you out about plot holes if you cared to explain them but at the moment your arguments are equally moot to that of an anti-vaxer. Just saying that there are plot holes doesn't make you right just like saying that vaccinations give you autism with no arguments to back it up doesn't validate anything.\\nI think people are so quick to judge this film because they loved the first 3 from back in the day. I'd love for people to go back and pick those films apart\\, if your willing to you can find flaws in anything. For example the lack in suspense when Bobba Fett the proclaimed bounty hunter was taken down with next to no fight. At least in episode 2 there was a climatic build to the scene when his father jango was tragically taken out.\\nGirlfriend says I'm taking to long to finish my review so I'm just going to leave. Enjoy the film","true":true}
