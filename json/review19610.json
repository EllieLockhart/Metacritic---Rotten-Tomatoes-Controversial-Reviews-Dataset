Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It violates the established star wars Canon in many ways and fundamentaly fails to handle the character of Luke Skywalker in an appropriate way. In my opinion it is not even Rian Johnsons fault. It is the fault of Kathleen Kennedy and those People who should ensure that the new star wars films do NOT violate the OT characters and do dumb stuff with the star wars laws. The Action and some Twist are great though. Hate it or love it.","true":true}
