Deeply appreciated that Druckman didn\u2019t sellout and write something to please everyone. I\u2019ve usually associated gay as being a bit too annoyingly sensitive and too gentle (for lack of a better word...or maybe it\u2019s delicate)\\, but this movie is as gutsy and manly as it can get. But at the same time it steals your heart even though u might not be the same sexual orientation as Ellie u can\u2019t  help but sympathize and appreciate that there is love there. There\u2019s so much I want to say it\u2019s funny\\, the game play is so enjoyable but tbh I gotta keep playing. I think if there are complaints about this move it\u2019s bc some ppl a bit to sheltered (as this generation can be) to appreciate a story with some real struggle and some suffering and I kind of enjoy seeing fruitcakes like that squirm a little.\r\rAfter finishing: you can tell so much love went into creating this. There is such attention to detail\\, but at the same time\\, each step is leading us toward a bigger picture. Its hard for me to see how someone can not like it if they play it through\\, or even just play it half way through. Understandably I think some people were devastated by listening to some of the leaks\\, I went on nearly hate site towards the game and liked it\\, but well before the end of this journey I could see I was hasty in my reaction. It's a better story and more entertaining and more meaningful than most best pictures like Forest Gump\\, Braveheart\\, No Country for Old Men...and in comparing it to a book\\, it its in the same vein thematically as \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\"\\, but I feel even more superior because it was a sequel.\r\rI sympathize to those who heard about leaks and felt their high expectations were crushed. I know a theme of hope leaves you with this feeling that's hard to beat\\, like at the end of part 1. At the end of part 2\\, despite the insult you felt to your heart early on\\, you can tell as a gamer who longed to take a journey\\,  you were deeply respected and loved.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
