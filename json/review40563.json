Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst movie i saw in 2017. As a fan of the originals i felt slapped in the face. If Disney wants to rebuild Star Wars their own way\\, why bring out old iconic characters just to treat them like garbage? The movie is loaded with feminism and political agenda. Which i would still swallow had it presented a decent story. This movie has so many plot holes and poor character development that it forced me to research who was behind this disaster. I am boycotting the next couple of Star Wars movies just like i boycotted Michael Bay after Transformers 3. Its the least i can do to showsome respect for the originally trilogy.","true":true}
