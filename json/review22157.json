Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Knowledge of thousands of years of Jedi history is worthless. Yoda was hacked (he would never send a lightning bolt to kill a tree). Business and corporations are bad. Rich people all live in Vegas and gamble while beating horses. Lea would never have let purple hair lady sacrafice herself. Lea would have ordered her to go while she (Lea stayed). Po is an idiot. Risks are not worth taking. \\n\\nOn the plus side\\, Rey was awesome and Kylo Ren was good... but not good enough to save this film from JJ Menarebadrums  and Rian Johnsonistheworstdirectorever.","true":true}
