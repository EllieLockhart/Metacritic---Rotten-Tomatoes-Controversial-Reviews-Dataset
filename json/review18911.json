Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a Star Wars movie so it's going to have an audience however it made me feel like Johnson went online and looked at every fan theory about the questions raised in Episode VII and wrote a script just to say F*** YOU to the fans.","true":true}
