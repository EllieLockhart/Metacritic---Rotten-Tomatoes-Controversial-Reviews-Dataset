Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is beyond horrible. If this movie was left out of the franchise I would be happy because this movie shouldn't have been made. And don't get me started on the overrated red throne fight scene. That scene is so poorly done and I've never scene a worst fight scene. If you want proof look up Robot Head the last Jedi review and watch it for a deep dive on the abysmal scene. This movie is terrible","true":true}
