Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand the hate this movie is getting. I was in awe for the entire runtime (except for the casino world bit). This movie took risks with the Star Wars lore that really pay off for me. Some of the other fanboys really hated that i guess\\, but this movie did exactly what i didnt know i wanted it to. It surprised me at every turn and truly felt fresh and original\\, even when it mirrors elements of episode V and VI .Complicated themes and characters really leave you wanting more Star Wars. A truly satisfying entry to this great franchise\\, can't wait for the next one!","true":true}
