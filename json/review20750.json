Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to give a scathing review of The Last Jedi\\, but I really don't even care about how bad it was\\, because I will never pay money for Star Wars anything\\, again.","true":true}
