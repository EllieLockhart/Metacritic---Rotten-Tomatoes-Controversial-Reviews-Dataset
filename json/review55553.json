Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Normally I could care less about how a film is rated by others. If I love a film\\, I really don't care what other people think about it. Also\\, rarely do I add my two cents to sites like this\\, I feel it's kind of pointless adding my one little opinion to the sea of others. But this time I felt I *needed* to.\\n\\nI've been a die hard Star Wars fan since I saw STAR WARS back in '77. I've watched every film multiple times since then. Sure\\, a few of them had some cringe-worthy moments\\, but I've always been able to find something to take away from each of them that I enjoyed and kept me coming back for more.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this movie\\, that's wonderful! I envy you\\, I *really* do! Because I know what an amazing feeling it is to watch a Star Wars movie and have it touch something inside you that makes you want to see it again and again. I've had that happen to me at least seven times in my life since 1977.\\n\\nUnfortunately for me\\, after watching The Last Jedi I felt depressed\\, and confused. And for the first time in my life I have no desire to see a Star Wars movie more than once. Also for the first time\\, I'm not anticipating the next movie in the franchise.","true":true}
