Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen TLJ twice now. After and during the first showing\\, I felt disappointed\/let down. I tried to go into the second showing a little more open-minded and with less expectations. It helped some\\, and I let some things go \/ not bother me as much. But I took notes of all the things I liked\\, all the things I disliked\\, and all the things I had conflicted feelings toward. I think I ended up with 36 things I liked\\, 35 things I didn't like\\, and a dozen things I still am not sure how I feel. The fact that the negative almost outweighed the positive should speak enough in itself. I admit\\, I went into this movie with alot of expectations.. as we all did.. as we all SHOULD. But boy was I let down. I can't actually believe I'm rating this less than 3 stars\\, but if I did anything else I'd be lying to myself. Theres some really good things\\, but theres some really bad things\\, and I don't understand how you can have so many bad things when you know what the fans want. Was it a bad movie? Of course not. Was it a bad Star Wars movie? Its difficult for me to admit\\, but kind of\\, yes.","true":true}
