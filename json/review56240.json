Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is an extremely intimidating and polarizing movie. And it's clear it does this intentionally. Might i say its a shame to see professional critics remain so out of touch with the feelings of fans.\\n\\nThe film brings the overall philosophy of all previous star wars films into question\\, by challening and destroying long standing ideals of the franchcise such as: (1) the role and characteristics of the force\\, (2) Who exactly can use the force\\, and what it takes to become powerful in it\\, and (3) the significance of the jedi in the universe\\, by questioning the integrity of their values and agendas\\, and ultimately destroying their 40 year legacy in a single film. Much loved legacy characters are deconstructed and destroyed in minutes. Long standing values of the franchise are flipped upside down\\, and taken in directions no one could have predicted. Plots and characters set up by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens are dismissed with a few sudden \\\"haha tricked yah!\\\" moments . Albeit some of these surprises are enjoyable\\, but in a film where it's this divisiveness is a regularity\\, it most certainly will be too much for most viewers.\\n\\nWith its fair share of eccentric pacing and scene cuts\\, at the end of the movie carnage the viewer will be left saying just one thing: \\\"WTF just happened?\\\" Unfortunately fans are served a meal that many won't be able to digest. And it goes without saying - The Last Jedi is certainly the odd one out in the franchise. \\n\\nEither Disney wishes to take Star wars in a completely alternative direction\\, or Ryan Johnson is just in it to challenge what will later be rectified in future releases.","true":true}
