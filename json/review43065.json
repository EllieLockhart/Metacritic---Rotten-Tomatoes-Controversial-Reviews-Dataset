Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie went downhill from the beginning with unfunny snarky dialogue\\, recycled scenes\\, unconvincing CGI\\, and shear stupidity. I finally walked out when Leah transformed into Space Marry Poppins. Everyone involved with this film deserves to be blacklisted from the film industry. I was more entertained this week by Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.","true":true}
