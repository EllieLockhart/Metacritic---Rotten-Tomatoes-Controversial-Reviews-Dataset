{"101487":175853,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was great\\, like Luke said it's not going to go the way you want it. Kylo is growing\\, Rey is discovering herself\\, Luke redeemed his failure & Leia shows strength never before seen. It's not to long\\, I didn't feel the 2hrs. I got to see it again\\, the sacrifice Laura dern does is awesome big thumb and a hell yea to last Jedi!","true":true}
