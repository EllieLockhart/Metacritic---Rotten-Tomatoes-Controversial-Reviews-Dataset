Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot holes are terrible. The writer for this film seems to be at odds with the writer of the previous. There was no viable  explanation why a son would kill his father that would Inspire the heroines support of the villain. The back and forth between serious moments and bad comedy robbed from what could have been real story building scenes. I could go on but needless to say I saw little if anything redeeming about this trash.","true":true}
