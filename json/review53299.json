Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deeply dissapointed in the direction Disney has taken the franchise. They've completely destroyed Star Wars. Not only did they rewrite who the original characters are\\, they've killed them all off. Without any feeling whatsoever. I don't even think I can convey how upset and dissapoint I am that Disney would do this to those that were true to the original trilogy. This is nothing more than a way to pass the torch to a new generation and screw everybody else to make more money from a new generation. That's the real message here. It has nothing to do with the story or tradition. It is what it is. And now it's over. Thanks Disney!","true":true}
