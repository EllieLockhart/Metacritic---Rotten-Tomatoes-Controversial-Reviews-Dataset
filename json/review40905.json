Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroyed my childhood. There are so many plot holes...like the rebels are being chased by the First Order....yet Finn can go off galavating to a different world and then manage to get back to the rebel ship. The movie Is also very similar to the empire strikes back. Where Rey goes to get training from Luke....like how Luke went and got training from Yoda in Empire Strikes back. But Rey gets only like one hour of training from Luke. Luke also dies pointlessly and basically there goes the whole Skywalker legacy. The rest of the plot is simply and unrealistic. There are just so many other holes....just disgusted at what Disney has done to the franchise....they really wasted Luke as a character.","true":true}
