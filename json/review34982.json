Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film took the Star out of Star Wars and turned it into kid wars. No character development\\, weak story\\, all the set ups form the Force Awakens were thrown out the window and Rian Johnson shat on all the original characters. So sad. RIP STAR WARS.","true":true}
