Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been watching the Star Wars films since childhood and carried the tradition on with my children. The series has been a part of my world for as long as I can remember and this is the first time I have considered not buying a film from the series. I am so disappointed. Bad characters\\,  graphics\\, and concepts. Poor planning and plot holes. Ridiculous story lines and a useless\\, unrealistic romance. Scrap this director and move back to JJ and maybe he can restore the Skywalker family's former glory.","true":true}
