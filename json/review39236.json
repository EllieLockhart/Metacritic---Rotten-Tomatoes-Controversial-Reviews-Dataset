Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film failed to resonate with me as a movie in its own right and stands as an abomination for a Star Wars main film instalment. It is so self absorbed in trying to be socially relevant and going out of its way to contradict fan theories that the fun factor is entirely non existant. It's greatest crime is in how it treats arguably one of the greatest heroes in pop culture history\\, Luke Skywalker\\, emasculating and disfiguring him to the point where he is a barely recognisable defeated and miserable man. This wasn't taking him into a new direction\\, this was simply a flat out mistake. I have never ever felt this frustrated about any film\\, least of all a Star Wars film. I have never ever considered taking time to sign up on a review website to comment on anything until now\\, so this is my first time rating anything. This film wasn't just a disappointment\\, it is a tragedy.","true":true}
