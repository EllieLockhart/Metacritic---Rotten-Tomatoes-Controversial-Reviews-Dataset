Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not my Luke Skywalker. An unfulfilling entry in the saga and an odd middle to a trilogy that's seems to be going nowhere. Inconsistent with the force awakens. Nothing sticks with you or makes you care about the next movie. Forget the past\\, kill it if you have to I guess. I liked the Porgs. ","true":true}
