Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Steaming pile of rancid feces.  Lazy and poor storytelling\/writing\\, zero new character development\\, answered no questions established in ep 7\\, killed the old characters in a vain attempt to make you care about the new charisma vacuum characters like Rey and Finn.  Rian Johnson's \\\"vision\\\" for the movie and treatment of Luke skywalker's is criminal.  Save your money or just wipe your ass with it\\, either option is better than watching this dumpster fire of thinly veiled leftist propaganda","true":true}
