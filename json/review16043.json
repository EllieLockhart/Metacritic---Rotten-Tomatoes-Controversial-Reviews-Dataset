Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a lifelong fan. My hope in the SW story was renewed with Force Awakens. I put SW stickers on my car. Then\\, last night with the Last Jedi my heart was broken. There is no main character\\, no hope\\, and at the end my hero Luke Skywalker died without us knowing why or how. Leia can use the force? Ben teases us with turning toward the light only to go completely dark. Rey doesn't get properly trained and we still don't know who her parents are. Snoke's identity isn't revealed. I left the theater confused\\, upset\\, and sad. This movie was the worst disappointment since Lucas's joke of a film Episode 1. I'm taking the stickers off my car. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this film in theaters\\, watch it drunk or high on Netflix\\, and maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of it.","true":true}
