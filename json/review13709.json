Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find it shocking that this has such a low audience rating\\, and I created a rotten tomatoes account specifically to give this movie a better score. In my opinion\\, this was the best Star Wars film yet\\, on par with the empire strikes back. Bold\\, daring\\, and flat out phenomenal\\, this movie deserves more than a 57% score.","true":true}
