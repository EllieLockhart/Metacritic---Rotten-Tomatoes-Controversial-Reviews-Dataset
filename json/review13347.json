Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it.  I came in with no expectations of worry of validating any theories so I could take it as it was.  There were a few elements I might have changed\\, but it isn't my movie.  Overall\\, it's refreshing to get something new that isn't the standard \\\"Skywalker story.\\\"  Sure\\, it still focuses the same overall\\, but definitely uses your knowledge of Star Wars and how it has gone all this time against you.  Lots of red herrings and moments you wouldn't expect.  After a second viewing\\, without worrying about the shock reveals\\, I was able to enjoy the details a little more as well.","true":true}
