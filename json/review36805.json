Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie sucks. This is the worst Star wars movie ever. They completely fell off the Star wars cannon story and delivered a pointless and ridiculous story that failed to deliver the plots and promises set up by the Force Awakens. Is is a disgrace what Disney did to this movie and to the Star Wars fans all over the world. Really dissapointed.","true":true}
