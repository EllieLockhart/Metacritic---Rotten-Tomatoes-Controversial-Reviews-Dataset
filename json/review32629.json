Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a surprisingly underwhelming & poorly written film that manages to bastardize much of JJ Abrams' \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" & plays like it thinks it's from a different franchise of films entirely. It also seems to have forgotten that Star Wars is so deeply-rooted in mythological origins\\, which is part of what has always made these films so universally adored.  There are some likable moments however they're mostly overshadowed by the rest of this unfortunate mess.  By the end of its 2  1\/2 hour run-time I was left feeling truly frustrated & wholly disappointed.","true":true}
