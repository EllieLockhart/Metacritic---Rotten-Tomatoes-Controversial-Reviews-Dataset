Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It ruined Luke Skywalker's character\\, and was just another remake of Empire Strikes Back\\, just as Force Awakens was a remake of A New Hope. Cool fight scene\\, if it wasn't with someone who was beaten by a girl who never picked up a lightsaber before in her life in the last movie. Did Kylo Ren suddenly remember how to fight? This movie totally ruined Star Wars for me. I've been a die hard fan ever since the original trilogy came out\\, but I will stick to the first 6 movies. This new trilogy will not be in my collection.","true":true}
