The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is just as good as before\\, with a few new features\\, but generally the same\\, which isn't a bad thing- if it ain't broke don't fix it.The graphics are pretty good and the visuals are breathtaking as expected from a PS4 game.But it ain't the gameplay or the graphics that the fans\\, such as myself had bought the game. It was for Joel and Ellie. It was for their story that made \\\"The Last of Us\\\".And the writers had butchered it.The storytelling is horrendous. They tried to make \\\"Abby\\\"\\, the game's \\\"Antagonist\\\"\\, or another \\\"Protagonist\\\" (you can decide which one she is) likeable at all cost\\, which they miserably failed to do so. They tried to explain why she killed the game's most beloved character and then make us sympathise with her\\, but their attempts were so sloppy\\, that I only saw her as the \\\"villain\\\" who killed my favorite character.The game tried to teach you a lesson that \\\"revenge is bad\\\" (Unless you're Abby\\, because she gets a free pass\\, apparently )\\, but of course\\, first\\, it will force you to go on a manhunt and commit mass murderer in order to exact your revenge on \\\"Abby\\\"\\, only for Ellie to spare her at the end after sacrificing literally everything.The story had also dumbed down most of the major characters. Mainly Joel. This is a character who was supposed to be an apocalyptic survival expert with over a decade of experience\\, but he just had to die in the dumbest way ever and that is by making an amateur mistake... Mind you\\, I am not specifically mad at the developers for killing Joel\\, I am mad for how poorly they executed it.When you play a game\\, a good game\\, you don't want it to end. You want to keep going and you're playing with excitement and anticipation\\, wondering where the story is going to take you next. It wasn't like that with this game. After roughly about 3 hours of gameplay\\, I stopped caring. It felt like I was forcing myself through emotional torture while trying to convince myself \\\"it will be worth it in the end\\\".It really wasn't.When it finally ended. I was left hollow. I was so disappointed that I didn't even want to look at the game ever again\\, I placed it at the back of my shelf to gather dust and lay forever forgotten. It's like a bad movie you can only watch once and don't want to talk about it after it's over.7 years of waiting and this is what we get.Shame on you Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
