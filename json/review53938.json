Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. I've been a fan of the saga for nearly 40 years\\, and this is really one of the best in the franchise. Lucasfilm is knocking it out of the park with the sequel films. This film is rich in emotion\\, story\\, stunning visuals and excellent acting. The hero's and heroine's journeys are playing out beautifully here. I can't wait to see how it concludes! My only complaints are kid actors who can't act\\, and Finn's story being reduced to a space horse race. Rose is a decent character. I hope the two of them get a more pivotal and entertaining part in the story for 9.  I won't address the haters\\, the hater bots\\, or the fanboy whiners directly. I will simply say if you like this movie\\, don't let the hate deter you. And if you are rooting for redemption\\, don't let people gaslight you. The Skywalker Saga isn't likely to end in tragedy. mtfbwy","true":true}
