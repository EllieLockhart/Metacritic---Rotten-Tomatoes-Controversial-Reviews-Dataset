We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I firmly believe and after having played the game 3 times\\, which is a very good game\\, its technical and sound section is perfect\\, its gameplay is as fun as the first\\, but this one perfects it excellently\\, the music is magical and always transmits everything a splendid feeling\\, the story\\, I think it is good\\, maybe it is not a masterpiece like the first The Last Of Us but it is very good\\, I understand that the player does not like it in the first instance\\, I hated it the first Once\\, but after playing it a second time and analyzing everything\\, I concluded that if it really transmits so many feelings to you and in such a faithful way\\, hate\\, courage\\, violence\\, sadness\\, tiredness\\, just magnificent. Maybe Abby's character is the worst of all\\, and that's what makes me give her a 9 instead of a 10 but I sincerely believe that Naugthy Dog did an excellent job for the rest. My only point against it is that Abby's development was not the best it could have been\\, maybe if they had presented him before seeing how he kills Joel\\, the player could have better sympathized with him.In short\\, The Last of Us Part 2 is a very good game\\, I could say that it far exceeds the first The Last Of Us in most sections.the only thing that remains just a little below is in the field of history\\, just a little.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
