Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi nudges Star Wars in a new direction.  It definitely feels as if the saga we've known is coming to an end but also teases that the SW universe is larger than we know and holds unexplored mysteries.  The action sequences are well done and the overall imagery is stunning. The acting is solid.  The dialog and storyline bog down a bit midway through but the overall arc is satisfying.  This film well worth watching.","true":true}
