{"101487":197293,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With many people\\, it's like Fridge Logic. They see the movie\\, and it's later that it sinks in how bad it was\\, and they start to think \\\"Hang on! That was Stupid!\\\". Before then\\, their immediate reaction is overwhelmed by the SFX and pretty stuff. The Last Jedi has beautiful cinematography\\, an excellent musical score\\, and that's it for the pluses. The plot is ridiculous. The stupidity of the writers in not knowing the most basic things about Space and Gravity is even worse. It's a sequel to \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" yet The Last Jedi seems to ignore every success gained by the heroes\/goodguys in The Force Awakens. They've redefined Finn - who was a combat experienced stormtrooper - into a mere janitor\\, and as the black man\\, he's also portrayed as even more stupid than the white men. Popular characters that people wanted to see\\, characters that we admired\\, well written\\, had shown development in the older movies - just turned upside-down and effectively destroyed as an insult to the fans. Where are the light sabre duels? None. Not one light sabre duel in the entire movie. Rey is made into even more of a boring Mary Sue character than she was in The Force Awakens. Zombie flying Mary Poppins was just an insult to the memory of Carrie Fisher. Kylo Ren comes across as even more of a useless brat that whines all the time\\, and can't seem to stay in character. The First Order was originally a mixed bunch of Imperial wannabes who wanted to return the Empire but are turned into a Neo-Nazi All-White-Male super-empire as if NOTHING from The Force Awakens had happened\\, and in an obvious attempt to frame all white men as Eeeeeeevil. Poe\\, the hero of the Resistance in The Force Awakens is turned into a comical exaggeration of the \\\"gung-ho\\\" guy\\, then crapped all over by Mary Sue female characters. Every male in the movie is made out to be stupid egotistical bastards and fools\\, even their best efforts are treated as garbage and ruined\\, so a female character can be shown getting all the limelight. \u00a0Luke the \\\"original hero\\\" deserved a heroic return\\, not a demolition of his character. Luke Skywalker turned into an evil bastard who would willingly kill the only son of his twin sister and his best friend. The Resistance ONLY has female top commanders\\, they demote Poe on bullshit very early in the film\\, and he was the only male character with any senior rank in the Resistance but he's shoved down and demoted. Not only is every male in the movie portrayed in a really bad way\\, treated like trash\\, insulted\\, the token black man is treated even worse so it's racist as well as sexist crap. By the way\\, being anti-male and anti-white\\, and being anti-white-male is both racist and sexist too. There's no character development. There are literal Mary Sue female characters all over the place! Rey is just one among many; no character background\\, no development\\, no actual \\\"Hero's Journey\\\" struggle to grow and improve - just BOOM\\, SUPER-JEDI! It's rotten stinking really stupid movie. The public doesn't mind female badass characters\\, they've never had problems with badass female characters.\u00a0\\n\\nThe problem is that men being portrayed as ALWAYS idiots\\, ALWAYS portrayed in a bad way. Black men like Finn's character are demeaned even more. The sexism and racism is easy to see. Compare how women and men are treated in this movie. Compare how black men are portrayed. It's racist to the extreme\\, sexist to the extreme. White men are portrayed as nearly entirely evil\\, the \\\"First Order\\\" introduced in The Force Awakens is retconned to be ENTIRELY EVIL WHITE MEN in \\\"The Last Jedi\\\". That's more extreme racism.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi portrays every man in the Resistance\\, and men in general as idiotic. That's sexist. Awful\\, horrible\\, truly sucky bad movie that should have been written off without being released.","true":true}
