Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly this was truly the Empire Strikes Back of this new trilogy that we needed. 10\/10\\, I laughed\\, I cried\\, I was shocked\\, my garden was watered\\, my skin was cleared of transition acne\\, my voice dropped two octaves\\, and the government issued me a photo ID with my legal sex on it. Well\\, everything except the last bit\\, but this movie gave me enough hope that I'm more than happy to continue the rebellion until all the civil rights of myself and other marginalized and oppressed people are fully met.","true":true}
