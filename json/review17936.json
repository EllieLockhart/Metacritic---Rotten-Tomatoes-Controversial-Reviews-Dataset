Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think I expected too much from this movie. It seemed as though everything that was built up by JJ from FA was killed off or a big let down. Finn and Rose story arch was a waste of talent. The director said Luke was his hero in an interview\\, but he didn't do him justice and even Hamill himself didn't agree with his part. Maybe JJ will correct all the mistakes and missed opportunities this movie seemed to have. He seems to at least care about what came before and honor it. There were seven movies that came before and felt like they belonged this doesn't. I have no idea how the last movie in this trilogy will go since everything that was built up is pretty much gone. Enjoyed Yoda and Luke vs Renn (wish it was longer and real). Okay movie but was disappointed for a Star Wars main saga movie.","true":true}
