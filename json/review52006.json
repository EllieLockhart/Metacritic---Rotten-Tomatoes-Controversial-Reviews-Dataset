Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a second viewing\\, most if not all of my \\\"concerns\\\" with The Last Jedi have already faded into oblivion. This is a fantastic Star Wars film and one of my favorite films from 2017. There is so much packed into this 152 minutes it doesn't at all feel long. \\n\\nWhat I love about Star Wars is that most of the time an episode leaves us with some answers and even more questions. This movie does that expertly. My hat is off to Rian Johnson\\, John Williams and of course this expert cast. \\n\\nWill wait until viewing 3 to post a more lengthy review\\, but just wanted my opinion out there!","true":true}
