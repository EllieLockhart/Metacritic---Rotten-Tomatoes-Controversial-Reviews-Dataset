Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A slow train wreck that never happens leaving one to feel cheated and disappointed. The fact the movie works so hard to break the \\\"cycle\\\" of light vs. dark only to revert back to divided lines causes confusion and horrible story writing.","true":true}
