But look at it through another angle its mirroring Joel and Joel mirrors Ellie through first game Ellie beginning was more trustive while Joel was less through grief while second one Joel more trustive Ellie less trustive .But I think Whats smart is in first game about dark world and a light Ellie entering shining it up while second one its Abby going in a light world and darkening it up.Also i think Abby part was a failure.Abby Motivations Weak Compared to Joel #1.Mess Up Joel makes a choice to deal with grief of losing responsibility while Abby lost the sense of comfort safety and its weaker since Joel already lost that and more Joel lost someone he was supposed to love (which he did) and protect (which he failed through trust) (And I like Joel death mirrors trust but Joel death scene felt weak since Abby didn't care even though he saved her and she never feels remorse and her friends enjoyed it and said he deserved more that gives off less sympathy and makes you root for her death and feels like torture and ruins the experience).Etc.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
