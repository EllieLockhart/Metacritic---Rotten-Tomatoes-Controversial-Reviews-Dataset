Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get the hate.  I really do.  But I still think this is really the best Star Wars movie since Empire.  First off\\, it was an incredibly made film with superb acting and directing.  As far as writing and plot goes\\, sure I can get why people are disappointed and even devastated\\, but I think this is the bold new direction we need after TFA.  Is this perfect? Certainly not\\, but I am willing to overlook the glaring flaws to see the masterpiece of a film before us.  I like what they did with Luke.  SPOILERS.  Having him just being an all powerful hero would have been too predictable and boring.  Give him a conflict.  Kylo Ren was amazing\\, so much better than in TFA.  I love his connection to Rey and how they momentarily team up.  I love Poe's arc\\, even though there are a few problems with it.  I am so-so on FInn's plot\\, although it is growing on my as time goes on.  I think Rose was unnecessary\\, but still a likeable character.  Leah's space scene was cringy\\, but at least we got to see her use the force.  For all those saying this ruined Star Wars\\, just forget about this movie and go and watch the OT forever.  I don't see how this movie can ruin that trilogy for you if you just disregard it.  And please try to understand that this is a good movie and the bold move we need.","true":true}
