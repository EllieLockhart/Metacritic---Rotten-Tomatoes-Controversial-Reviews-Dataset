Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Positives:\\nGreat space battles.\\nAmazing light saber choreography\\, with beautiful cinematography during these scenes.\\nRelationship between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, and how they were both conflicted about being good\/bad. Luke's fear about Rey turning to the dark side.\\nA lot of good acting.\\nSome interesting political statements.\\n\\nNegatives:\\nLuke's actions\/dialogue. First scene of him throwing the lightsaber says it all.\\nToo much comedy\\, many jokes did not land and overall undermined serious scenes.\\nNo Knights of Ren. Snoke + Phasma end up being meaningless characters.\\nUndermined a lot of the first movie. Luke didn't train Rey\\, Snoke didn't train Kylo.\\nThe whole Casino scene + Finn and Rose Subplot (Awful).\\nFirst Order are useless.\\nLeia Flying...\\nCGI Yoda from far away but Puppet up close! Why not just use a Puppet for the whole thing\\, ruined the moment a bit.\\n\\nOverall feel the movie didn't give the hardcore Star Wars fans\\, the previous film and some of the original Characters the respect they deserved.","true":true}
