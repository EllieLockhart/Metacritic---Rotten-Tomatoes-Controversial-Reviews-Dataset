Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never have reviewed a movie before but I had to say this.  I saw my brother at Christmas and he knew I had seen this movie last week and he hasn't seen it yet.  He didn't want the movie spoiled but asked a few loose questions about it.\\n\\nHe asked me what the plot to this movie is.  After thinking about it for a minute I realized I couldn't answer that question.  This movie was such a mess with such bad pacing and gaping holes to the story\\, I really couldn't say what it was actually about.\\n\\nMy brother then asked if there is any follow up\/answers to the questions brought out in The Force Awakens.  Ummmmmm......No.  \\n\\nHe then asked if Ren\/Rey\/Finn\/Poe and their stories progress.  Yeahhhh\\, not really.  \\n\\nSo\\, he asked who is the main character\\, is it mostly about Luke?.........\\n\\nNope....we see Finn go on a journey to a casino with a new character Rose\\, this is mostly what I remember\\, as this seemed to be a major plotline.  Is Rose a stormtrooper or Jedi he asked.....nope\\, a janitor and a pretty boring addition at that.\\n\\nDoes Rey train with Luke?  Sure\\, for about 6 minutes.\\n\\nAre there classic lightsaber battle scenes?  Welllll\\, sort of?\\n\\nIt was during this conversation that I realized how badly this movie sucked.  JJ Abrams has his work cut out for him in fixing this mess to move on in 9.  May the Force be with him.","true":true}
