Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you love the stories George Lucas has gifted us with\\, you will most likely hate this movie. I never have wanted to walk out of a Star Wars movie before and I just couldn't wait for this to end. This felt like fanfiction or a parody of Star Wars. It was too aware of itself. There was no character development. Finn continues to be too contemporary and his story line with Rose literally made me say WTF during the film. Most of this movie I was just asking myself what the point of anything was. I'm so confused\\, sad\\, and completely disappointed. This one hurts. ","true":true}
