Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All though I did have a ton of fun watching all the stunning visuals and intense action sequences\\, the movie seems to ignore everything The Force Awakens sets up and leaves a bunch of questions unanswered\\, creating a TON of plot holes that are enough to piss off any Star Wars fan.","true":true}
