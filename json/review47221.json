{"101487":195334,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-08-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an utter tragedy. The beginning of the end of Star Wars. I really liked The Force Awakens. Rey was fantastic. Finn had so much potential. Poe was a bad ass pilot akin to the Rebel days of past. BB8 was hilarious and a fantastic comedic relief. Kylo Ren was awesome\\, torn between the light and dark. Constantly battling his inner demons.  Well..... Rian Johnson turned all that potential to shit. He single handedly turned Star Wars into a joke. A bad\\, bad joke. He absolutely destroyed Finn\\, who had the greatest potential of all the characters to be something amazing\\, and if I was John Boyega\\, I'd be absolutely pissed. He turned him into a side show clown with absolutely no character arc whatsoever. You deserved so much better John. I watched your other films after The Last Jedi and I know you're the real deal. He turned Rey into an unstoppable force with no charisma\\, no motive\\, no adversity\\, no story and no hope of redemption. I loved you so much in TFA\\, but there is nothing JJ can do to save you. Rose Tico is a throw away character who is completely useless\\, boring\\, and made absolutely so sense at all. Kelly\\, it's not your fault. Please know that some of us understand the difference between you\\, and a character you portray. Rose Tico had the worst line in Star Wars hostory. Her last line was literally the dumbest thing ever said in a movie\\, considering what her sister had done at the begining of the movie.  Admiral Holdo\\, what else is there to say. I'd love to go on a two hour rant about how much that character sucked\\, but I dont want to become enraged and throw things across my house. The next Admiral of a fleet of gritty dying soldiers with almost no hope of survival better not be wearing a f'ing ballgown. The real Princess Leia would have torn her apart. Some people want to play the \\\"She might have thought there was a mole on the ship\\\" card\\, but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Now we move onto the biggest money grab\\, butt reaming\\, worst abuse of a new character EVER. Even worse than Darth Maul.... Captain Phasma. Phasma was poised to be awesome. She looked awesome\\, she sounded awesome\\, she was soooo f'ing cool looking\\, and BOTH JJ and Rian kicked her to the curb.  What a waste. What wasted potential. She was probably the only character IN THE ENTIRE NEW TRILOGY THAT COULD HAVE HAD HER OWN STAND ALONE MOVIE! Now\\, no one cares\\, Its over. Rian Johnson\\, I hope your happy. I really really hope to God you thought you were making a decent movie and you didnt intentionally troll MILLIONS of people. Take that in for a second. Literally MILLIONS. The silent (and sometimes not so silent) majority HATED this movie. I dont know a single man\\, woman or child that enjoyed The Last Jedi. It was a failure that I've never seen in my 40 years of life from a studio of this stature. I've given up. There is no redemption for this. JJ cant save this trilogy. I didnt see Solo because of TFA\\, and I wont be seeing Ep 9. I cant bring myself to do it\\, and it breaks me up inside. TFA is the first Star Wars movie I didnt purchase\\, and I purchased 3 different collector copies of TFA. I bought a ton of TFA merchandise\\, but after TLJ\\, I was done\\, I cant do it. This finally brings us to Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill\\, I love you man. You were my beacon of hope. You were the greatest Jedi that ever lived. Rian did you dirty man. The likes of which I've never seen. I'm so sorry for you and your family. I honestly\\, sincerely mean that. As a father\\, I could not even imagine having your three children see what he did to you after a 40 year legacy\\, the likes of which will NEVER be seen again. Jake Skywalker died on that rock Mark\\, not Luke.","true":true}
