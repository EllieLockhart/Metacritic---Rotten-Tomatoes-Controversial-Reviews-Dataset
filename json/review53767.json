Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film.  Go see it.  Ignore the bad 'fan' reviews. I cannot help but think that those giving the ridiculously low ratings are being spiteful.  I can accept low ratings because each of us have our own preferences but really some of these reviews are beyond nonsense.  I never post but felt so compelled to do so after seeing this engaging and fun film\\, not perfect but money not wasted by any means\\, being unfairly ravaged.  \\n\\nThe good thing about what Rian has done is he has opened up the storyline which will allow for interesting plot developments in the subsequent sequels.  Too many films reboot without a thought given to 'where so we go from here?'  I can clearly see where the new characters\/storylines are going forward and I am interested in finding out what happens seems like this is the whole purpose of The Last Jedi and that is fine.  No spoilers in my review just praise for the characters old and new.","true":true}
