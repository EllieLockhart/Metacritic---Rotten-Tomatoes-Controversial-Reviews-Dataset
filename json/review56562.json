{"101487":175153,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise\\, here's why. The movie wants to be the empire strikes back\\, SO badly\\, but still couldn't deliver. It had too many \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2twists\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2? and I say \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2twists\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2? because after a while you could predict what was going to happen. There were probably 11 large twists which get annoying\\, the reason the \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2I am your father\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2? scene was good because we didn't expect it. There were probably 3 twists In all of the empire strikes back\\, and in the end\\, the bad guys won. It subverted our expectations\\, this movie\\, did the opposite. The movie was directed by Rian Jhonson who screwed over any plans JJ Abrams (the director for the previous movie)\t had for the characters. \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2Daisy Ridley says JJ Abrams laid out a plan for the Last Jedi and Episode 9 but Rian Johnson discarded it.\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2? -Express. JJ Abrams probably had an arch for his characters to follow but Rian Jhonson disregarded it. Take Fin (John Boyega) for example\\, there is a scene in the movie where he \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2kills\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2\u00c2? his biggest rival\\, his previous commander Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). From this point\\, there is no real place for Finn's character to go in the next movie. As a result\\, he is on a suicide mission to save the resistance in another scene\\, by flying his ship into their cannon\\, but as we have seen before there is a plot twist which we all expected. His friend Rose Tico (Kelly Tran) stops him by crashing her ship into his. This was not a surprise\\, as I said we expected this. Which leaves the next director in a conundrum\\, what to do with Finn. Even though Finn is one of my favorite characters\\, killing him off is what they should've done\\, it would have been an amazing end to what could have been an amazing character. Don't even get me started on admiral Holdo (Laura Dern)\\, who never once shared her plan with her crew\\, not even when she was faced with mutiny did she try to explain her plan. What was she so scared of\\, an imperial spy? Like\\, come on. D-","true":true}
