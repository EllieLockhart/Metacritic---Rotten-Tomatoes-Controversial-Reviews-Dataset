Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete mess.  Movies are supposed to be consistent with their established universes\\, and this movie is not.  Key plot points and the style of this movie do not work within the Star Wars universe.  Illogically changing an established character (Luke) did not work.  Dropping the loose ends from the first part of the trilogy and leaving nothing for the third part were bold decisions that\\, again\\, did not work.\\n\\nThis movie has no redeeming value as part of the Skywalker saga and minimal value as a standalone film.","true":true}
