The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of Us: Part II plot is just plain bad. It's flat\\, like a first draft. It's not bold\\, it's lazy. The old characters' actions do not hold up to what they did in the first installement (Joel shouts out his name to strangers\\, Tommy is just a senseless killer and Ellie is a dark\\, horrible person) and the new characters are just simply boring\\, unlikeable people the developers try to make us empathize with via really manipulative and lazy strategies. Ellie kills dogs\\, Abby plays with dogs\\, Manny's father has Parkinson's disease\\, etc.  Dina and her ex are so boring and flat\\, you couldn't care less if they were in the game or not. Abby is just a sociopath\\, who would've killed pregnant Dina if it wasn't for Lev. Owen is a cheating bastard\\, Mel is a passive aggressive and incredibly irresponsible woman (she goes on missions while pregnant) and Manny is a very bad written latin sterotype. Lev and his sister are Okay\\, I guess\\, given the fact that they have background as \\\"scars\\\"\\, and they uphold this aura of mystery. but that's pretty much it. I wanted Abby and her friends to die so bad\\, I struggled to finish her timeline. Abby's father is a jackass that puts his life and the life of his daughter at risk to save a zebra\\, like\\, come on man\\, you're the town doctor\\, don't flee like that.  Maybe it is on the graphics perspective it's a historic moment\\, but not at all on storytelling. They CLEARLY wanted us to like Abby\\, not to hate her\\, they tried to do it via those lazy and manipulative strategies I mentioned before\\, it does not make any sense what they are saying about this game being amazing by making you play as **** Abby\\, forcing you to do it if you want to finish the game. This is a triple A title\\, they would't risk it like that\\, it's not and indie game\\, for God's sake. This is not how you do the \\\"ego death\\\" thing. Like Angry Joe said\\, you could've played as Abby from the beginning\\, let us see her trauma\\, then let her meet Ellie\\, make them bond\\, fight together\\, then they could both find out the truth\\, maybe Abby knew all along\\, then Abby Kills Joel and Ellie kills Abbie\\, but you get that bittersweet drama at the end. But no\\, it's not like that\\, it's lazy as **** Naughty Dog didn't play with my soul\\, they played with my expectations\\, giving us all false advertising and writing a really bad story for the sequel of one of the best games\\, if not the best game of all time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
