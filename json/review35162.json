Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens\\, while borrowing major plotlines from episode 4\\, built a very strong cast of new characters\\, intriguing storylines\\, mysteries\\, and captured the feel of the original star wars universe.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi unraveled all of that.  It decapitated many of the mysteries from the previous film while also introducing nothing original or exciting.  The entire plot of the film was a mess\\, basically focusing on a leisurely space ship chase through space that in the end resulted in nothing.","true":true}
