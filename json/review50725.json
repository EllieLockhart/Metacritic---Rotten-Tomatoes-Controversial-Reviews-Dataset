Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A 90 percent rating is a joke. These critics dont know what they are talking about. The movie wasn't very good to put it bluntly. It felt unnaturally goofy at times and the pacing was way too fast and there was never any moments where anything was calm and trying to work the plot. Things just felt out of place. Luke acts stupid in this movie. A lot of the questions we all have been wanting answered either never get answered or we get a shitty anticlimactic answer. At times it felt like I was watching a parody. I like revenge of the sith better than this. There is just no depth in any of it. Its just a really long chase scene and battles. This should have been the movie to bring the darkness and depth to star wars on screen!!! It certainly felt like it was going to!","true":true}
