Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was at best a mixed bag.  Very slow.  Too long.  Some scenes were great and some were like why are they in the movie.  Felt like there was too much for one movie.","true":true}
