Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite its flaws\\, my overall impression of the movie was great. The visuals were stunning\\, the story of Luke was bold and interesting and the building of Rey and Ben's relationship was so enchanting\\, just watching the two of them find common ground in the struggle of finding their place in the ancient religions and in the nexus of good and evil. It was a great continuation of the story and I'm beyond excited to see how episode 9 will conclude the saga! ","true":true}
