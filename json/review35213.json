Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The franchise had been disneyfied\\, and it feels like there was an executive with a checklist over the director's shoulder in every scene. \\n\\\"According to our research team there\\, you gotta add some cute critters\\, at least one more light saber fight and some spiritual shit scene\\\". \\n\\nAll the life was sucked from it\\, and there nothing but an empty shell left. What a shame.","true":true}
