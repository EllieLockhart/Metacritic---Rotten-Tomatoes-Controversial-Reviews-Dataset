Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was excellent.  It was fun and a good escape for me and my family.  If you take Star Wars and life too seriously\\, you can always take shots at the story but it was well made and fun to watch.","true":true}
