Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok...this definitely isn't on the level of the previous trilogies but it's in the area. The new cast of characters is growing on me. Even though I do miss the seasoned vets. The action sequences we're good. The plot initially was confusing but eventually it came together. The ending was well done and had a nice touch to it. I did enjoy it\\, no high expectations. They could have done better but it wasn't a horrible movie. Definitely go check it out. #STARWARS #LASTJEDI #ISITREALLY #KIRR","true":true}
