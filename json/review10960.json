Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haven't seen a Star Wars film this bad since The Phantom Menace. \\n\\nThe 2 big deaths that happen in this film are so weak. Snoke dies like a clown. Why even bother pretending his was ever strong? He's like the Jar Jar Binks of the Sith.\\n\\nLuke dies in VERY weak fashion. Without even a duel? Obi Wan at least fought with his advisory before sacrificing himself. Luke just stood there. He basically died exactly like Han.\\n\\nLeia can fly like superman now... yuck.\\n\\nFinn and Rose... yuck. \\n\\nThe run time is WAY too long. \\n\\nI wanted to like this\\, but just left very disappointed\\n\\nI'm not understanding all the positive reviews for this film. I can only assume they were afraid of being blacklisted by Disney.","true":true}
