Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is phenomenal... This is the best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back. I loved everything about the movie. People are saying it is slow. Well not all movies are made to be fast paced. Rian Johnson is great. Mark Hamil\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver\\, Andy Serkis\\, Oscar Isaac\\, John Boyega and last but not least Carrie Fisher are great. This movie has best Luke moments and best Princess Leia moments in entire saga. \\n\\nBTW how can a critic hate The Last Jedi\\, Blade Runner 2049\\, Dunkirk and love bad movie as \\\"Guardians Of Galaxy Vol 2\\\"? Stop listening to paid critics of MCU. Go and watch it you will love it. This is my 4th favorite movie of the year following Blade Runner 2049\\, Dunkirk\\, Phantom Thread.\\n\\nGo and watch it... Don't miss it like you missed Blade Runner 2049 this year.","true":true}
