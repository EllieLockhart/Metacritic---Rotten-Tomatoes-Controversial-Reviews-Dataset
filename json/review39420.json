Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is the most Star Wars-esque film since Empire Strikes Back. Why are people so annoyed? People are complaining about unresolved plot points when we still have a whole other film to wait for. I admit it definitely wasn't what I expected but at least it was better than I expected. I would watch this again\\, for sure. People need to lighten up and actually think for a second - if everything was to stay the same then it would get boring\\, don't expect it to be exactly like the first one.","true":true}
