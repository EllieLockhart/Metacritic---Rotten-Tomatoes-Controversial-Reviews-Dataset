Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely no doubt the worst SW movie ever made. What is the point of Fin and Rose? Why can Rey use the force so well? Why is Luke such a sook and what is the first order\/where did they come from? Back story? Character arc? Refusing to see any more SW movies at the cinema ever.","true":true}
