Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite Star Wars film of all time!! This movie has two of my absolute favorite Star Wars scenes and I'm old enough to have seen A New Hope in the theater 6 times. Rian Johnson has created a masterpiece that only gets better with multiple viewings\\, three and counting!!","true":true}
