Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best Star Wars movie because it shows us something new in Star Wars. It doesn't fall back on the standard tropes and brings a new complexity to the characters that makes them vastly more interesting and human. The movie gives us hope and shows that it does not matter if you come from nowhere\\, you can do great things. This movie shows that the only way to win is not fighting what you hate\\, but saving what you love. This movie gave us hope that it is never too late to try and correct past wrongs\\, you can come back make things right. This movie took risks and they paid off with the best Star Wars movie of the series.","true":true}
