Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an SJW hot mess\\, which explains why critics have given it such good reviews across the board.  The message is too important for the film to be considered a failure. The Star Wars franchise is the latest victim of SJWs and feminists.","true":true}
