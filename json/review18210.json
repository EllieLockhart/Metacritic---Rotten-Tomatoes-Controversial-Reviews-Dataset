Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was the best of the series since \\\"Empire\\\".  I believe a lot of persons who are giving this less than stellar reviews are wanting less existentialism and more \\\"Let's blow $&(@ up.\\\"  The sorts of people who will find themselves \\\"bored\\\"  regarding this film are going to be your less educated types who want \\\"Rock-'em\\, Sock-'em Robots\\\" as a feature film.  Sorry\\, it doesn't work that way.  IMO\\, the equal of \\\"Empire\\\" or just slightly below it.  Simply in numerical order\\, Episodes IV\\, V and VIII are the cream of the franchise.","true":true}
