{"101487":169212,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[SPOILER ALERT]: Believe it or not\\, the force is strong in this one!  What I think is most appealing about this movie is the Character development.  We find our main protagonist Rey and antagonist Kylo with big questions about their position in this galactic conflict.  Their interactions and flirtation with ambivalence was presented during several scenes where they contact each other via the force.  By the end of the film these two characters are tempted to change sides\\, but ended defining themselves as light and dark force users\\, respectively.  Luke Skywalker\\, on the other hand\\, was turned apart about his role in the corruption and rise of Kylo Ren\\, therefore choses to die in solitude and in shame.  Full of regret\\, we witness a sour version of the jolly character that Gen Xers learned to care and love in the original installments of the story.  Luke resolves his internal conflict and realizes that he can't rescue Kylo Ren from his fate.  Luke goes on and dies a hero's death\\, and lives up to his legendary status of savior of the galaxy after pulling one of the coolest Jedi Trick ever shown on the big screen.  Finn and Rose were other characters that spends time in a side quest that was fruitless\\, and pointless some might add.  From my perspective\\, this sub-arc allowed the introduction of character Rose\\, who was portrayed as intrepid woman that believes and venerates heroes\\, but grieves her heroic sister's death.  On the other hand\\, coward Finn who attempted to dump the rebel forces during the beginning of the film\\, ended founding the courage that he lacked by attempting to sacrifice himself for the greater good.  Yes\\, Finn tries to justify his actions as a selfless act to find Rei and protect her from the First Order\\, but come on\\, who many times did he tried to pull that stunt in the previous movie.  I believe that in the end\\, Finn could find genuine courage on his own.  Rose intervention in Finn's crazy stunt allow her to show how two people can grow together in the face of adversity.  Poe also found himself almost castrated after his ship blows up and is demoted to Captain (and that kids\\, it's why nobody shared the original plan with him in the first place).  Happy trigger Poe found himself in a vulnerable position that led him to make several mistakes during the film\\, e.g. sending Finn and Rose in a wild goose chase.  At the end\\, Poe learned humility as he reflected on his flaws along with Leia.  Characters like DJ and Snoke were flat characters in a way\\, but served to the story.  Snoke offered extreme perspectives (going balls deep to the dark side of the force)\\, while DJ's character represented the middle grounds and gray areas intrinsic to war.  \\nThat said\\, the other aspect of this movie that really stands out is the \\\"out with the old\\, in with the new\\\" philosophy.  Not only Kylo's character endorsed this philosophy after killing off his Supreme Leader\\, but is also the general sense in the movie.  Scenes like force ghost Yoda burning the ancient tree\\, where supposedly the old texts were guarded\\, is other action that speaks to breaking old cycles to clear the way for new venues in the movie franchise.  We got a lot of nostalgia from Episode XII\\, down to blowing up yet a \\\"bigger Death Star.\\\"  In this movie\\, Episode VIII offers an Anti-nostalgic\\, quasi-nihilistic attitude that most fans found offensive.  An act of sacrilege that disrespected the legacy of previous installments some might say.  Lots of people's hearts were broken during the process\\, because they hold dear old Star Wars movies.  From my perspective\\, this makes this film even more important in the franchise\\, and will lead the way to even more exciting adventures in future films.  It's safe to say that the original trilogy had a decent conclusion. Stories usually don't go on to the extent that we witness the fate of our heroes. This is what happens when we want more of a good thing. But Star Wars movies makes a lot of money.  Adding to the saga in yet another trilogy calls for desperate measures to make more space for what is yet to come.  Episode VIII allowed the character and the franchise to mature and extend for new generations.  Hard as it maybe\\, the Star Wars audience wasn't ready to grow up like their movie did.  I acknowledge that I always enjoyed a good Star Wars movie\\, but I'm not a fan of the franchise.  I almost always try to focus on the elements within a movie to appreciate its artistic values (not to say that I'm totally objective on the subject\\, given that I think is almost impossible to anyone to have an objective review).  I think that Last Jedi has a lot of merit from an artistic point of view\\, and that many will definitively enjoy the movie.","true":true}
