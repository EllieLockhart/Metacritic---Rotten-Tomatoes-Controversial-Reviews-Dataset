Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Squandered opportunity. Still enjoyable but you only get to make the 8th episode of Star Wars once so why fall for all the faults of the prequel trilogy \u2014 the misplaced cheesy humor\\, the superfluous plots and characters just there for action \u2014 instead of really developing the great characters and storyline you have? Not as good that The Force Awakens or Rogue One. About at good as the Phantom Menace. ","true":true}
