Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney-Grade populist disappointment. Totally ignores the decades of mythos built up in the previous films\\, and even the premises set up in The Force awakes. But even if you're not a StarWars nerd\\, it's just a thoroughly mediocre space action flick that sacrifices character depth for explosions and cheesy lines.","true":true}
