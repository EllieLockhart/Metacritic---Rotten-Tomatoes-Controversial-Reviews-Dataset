Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a big promise\\, great cast\\, all that nostalgia - It should have been awesome\\, but it just didn't resonate. I love the franchise\\, but I simply couldn't care less about the characters\\, something in the direction of the story was off.\\nThat scene with Lea was the thing that killed my \\\"Suspension of disbelief\\\".\\nThe uninteresting arc\\, was a buzz kill and a waste of time.\\nI love that the movie was trying to be \\\"deeper\\\"\\, but it did this poorly.","true":true}
