Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Starts fast\\, slows down a bit and then really gets rolling. While the Last Jedi has moments that I did not enjoy it was filled far far more that I loved. It had many intensely emotional moments that sometimes were undercut by odd moments of humor. The movie has two main arcs one of those being the stronger of the 2. I am very interested to see what happens next!","true":true}
