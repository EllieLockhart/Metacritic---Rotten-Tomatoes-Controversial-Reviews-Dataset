Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A stunning and emotional ride with beautiful visuals and twists. However\\, fans of the original trilogy may feel betrayed and disrespected. The bold and radical choices appeal to some\\, but not all. If this was a course correction from the criticisms of episode 7\\, it was surely an overcompensation.","true":true}
