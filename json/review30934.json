Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed in this movie. It has a couple good moments. A couple funny moments but way too many misses\\, massive plot holes\\, characters that are shallow and disappointing in thier own right. I don't know what Disney was thinking on this. ","true":true}
