Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"El Humor de Marvel dafuq Rian Johnson???  Super awesome las escenas de batallas de naves.  Las escenas de relleno de Finn y Rose ugh.  La movie divierte un rato pero el tono de sube y baja te quita el ritmo y se hace sentir un poco off.  Me dej\u00f3 con ganas de m\u00e1s\\, ya veremos que va hacer JJ Abrams con esto.","true":false}
