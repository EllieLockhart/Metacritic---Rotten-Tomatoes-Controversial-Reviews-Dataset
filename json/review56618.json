Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the most refreshing Star Wars film I have seen in a long time. I would rate it higher than Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, and I actually liked Rogue One more than Force Awakens.\\n\\nUnlike other Star Wars movies\\, or modern movies today\\, The Last Jedi isn't a mindless predictable story with explosions.

In The Last Jedi you had that character do that\\, but ultimately fail\\, leaving the rest of the cast to pull what ever they had left within themselves just to survive another day.\\n\\nYou also have a new character that gets discounted by trigger happy character because of \\\"experience\\\"\\, but ultimately vindicated. With as little screen time this character had\\, the way she was vindicated and ultimately saved them was astonishing. It actually made me feel something for the character\\, which is something very hard to do with a character that new and short-lived.\\n\\nI have several friends who have nit-picked this movie to death and had complaints about several scenes. I call bs. These same people think that Dead Pool is quality entertainment...","true":true}
