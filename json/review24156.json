Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"May Contain Spoilers: \\nWith the story they had to work with\\, I would rather have spent 6 hours with Jar Jar Binks then watch this film again. Even if they overdid the CGI\\, and the charisma between Anakin Skywalker and Padme was terrible on Episodes 1-3\\, the rest of the acting was better and the story was solid.\\n\\n\\n\\nI always preferred Episode 4\\, 'A New Hope'\\, because it stood on its own. Everything else is a sequel or a prequel.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Rogue One was superior to this muddled mess. They should have made this one before Episodes 7 and 8.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we have a wondering repetitious story line\\, poor editing\\, a budget that did not allow any retakes\\, a few cute but fakey puppets\\, a number of locations that were underused\\, AND original cast members that looked like they had Alzheimer's\\, with dull eyes and speech impediments.\\n\\n\\n\\nA sophomoric attempt at sci-fi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice how much lower the audience score was compared to the critics?\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me help with the story: \\n\\nYoda is Darth Vader's father or grandfather. Luke is starting to look like Yoda. \\n\\nRey is Kylo Ren's twin sister or his daughter sent back in time.\\n\\nAnd Darth Vader is their love child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInteresting how Star Trek keeps getting better and Star Wars just gets worse.","true":true}
