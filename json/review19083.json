Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its got some really good parts and some disappointing parts. Luke was great to see but sad and cranky. Loved Leia. Porge very cute. Interesting take on things. Really opens up the future for new things and adventures.","true":true}
