Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie!!! I've been a life long Star Wars fan and I'm so disappointed in the last 3 movies\\, particularly this latest one. This one was just trash. The originals are by far the best. What's being put out these days is just awful. I found myself halfway through the movie hoping that the movie was almost over\\, and sure enough it kept going on and on with this awful Disney crap.","true":true}
