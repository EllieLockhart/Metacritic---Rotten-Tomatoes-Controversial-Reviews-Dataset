Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only a handful of entertaining scenes and shots\\, everything else is garbage. Everything thats wrong with Disney\u00b4s Star Wars and their SJW\/feminism agenda. It spits on the Star Wars franchise. poor George Lucas\\, poor  Mark Hamill.","true":true}
