Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen every SW movie made in the theater\\, everyone of them I went back to see at least once. I also own every one of them personally. This movie started great with Poe doing what Poe does. Then Leia \\\"Mary Poppins\\\" her way through space and a knot started to grow in my stomach. It didn't get any better from there\\, Rey hands Luke his dad's lightsaber and he throws it away like trash. What??? That is a Skywalker heirloom\\, at least keep it\\, lock it up. They make Luke look like an doddering old fart\\, Fin was misused\\, Phasma was misused.  The only coherent plot was Kylo\/Rey and it wasn't enough to save this movie. Han Solo dying I got\\, I hated it but I got it. The main SW line is about the Skywalkers\\, well now they don't exist anymore. Way to kill a franchise Rian Johnson\\, this will be the first SW movie I don't see again in the theater or buy. Frankly I think Disney should scrap this movie\\, sell it off as a dream or something and remake it. I would rate it no Stars\\, but the music and CGI make me are least like the background stuff.","true":true}
