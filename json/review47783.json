{"101487":196251,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I even start on this epic disaster of a movie. The reason this movie has 1 and a half star is because of the amazing acting capability and performance of Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill and Oscar Isaac. Daisy Ridley is truly an amazing actress and is holding this new franchise up at the moment. Her character has depth and her storyline is pretty wild\\, a few flaws though. Overall those movies wants to make me throw up. \\nThe negatives -\\n-Canto Bight - What the hell is this? Its supposed to be Star Wars\\, break some boundaries with new entertainment\\, aliens and culture\\, instead we are force fed propaganda on why casinos are bad and why is there even a casino exactly like it would be on earth in another galaxy? Waste of time and disturbing...I wish this scene never existed\\n-Poe - For some reason the directors wanted us to think Poe was dumb and incapable. His performance was awesome\\, his character was a complete and utter failure...\\n-Princess Leia flying- Give me a break...she died in the explosion and then decides to fly in space...what the heck...im done.\\n-Lack of Aliens - Lack of aliens need I say more...\\n-Luke - Luke was highly disappointing as a character. Even Mark Hamill coming out and saying that wasn't the Luke we all knew and loved\\, theres a problem. Hamill was amazing with his acting\\, his character sucked bantha shit....dissapointing especially making fans wait for it for over a year to see him return...\\n-Admiral Ackbar - One of the greatest generals in Star Wars lore gets a 1 second description of him dying saying \\\"Admiral Ackbar died\\\". Im throwing up now..\\n-Hidden Feminism Agenda- There a movies and avenues to battle political correctness\\, but lets be honest when it comes to Star Wars\\, give fans what they want. How did Star Wars become the epic franchise that it is today? By telling a story that little boys and men wanted to see and hear. In result they would bring their sisters and wife's to see the movie. The main target audience was men. Now that you have force fed an anti-male agenda\\, like why? What little boy is going to dress up as any of the female characters introduced? As far as I'm concerned there were no male roles to route for.....that's pathetic being a movie that sells to males...do you think little girls are buying Star Wars action figures? As a little kid I would be crying and saying why are men hated? \\n-Snoke - I have nothing to say\\, they ruined his character completely and was the biggest upset in Star Wars history\\n-Finn - Just why\\, he was moderately likeable the first in the new trilogy..now his storyline was useless. Plus that horrible and awkward kiss scene...just didn't need to happen.\\n-Rose - Can we remove the character from Star Wars lore right now?\\n-Annoying keybreaker - What was Star Wars thinking? This guy was annoying\\, useless\\, disturbing\\, pathetic...he had no place in Star Wars lore. I almost walked out when I saw this character on screen.\\nCaptain Phasma - How the heck do you get killed that quickly by Finn\\, especially if you're a highly trained captain?!!??!?!\\nAstral Projection Luke - This was one of the coolest things I have seen everything firing on Luke at once\\, then him withstanding it. But once you realize its just him astral projecting the beauty of the scene is done.\\nLuke giving up - Luke would never ever give up like that\\, let alone try and kill Kylo Ren...he's a jedi....\\nAnnoying purple haired general - Very annoying super annoying\\, not impressed and boring. There's a reason I don't know her name.\\nSaving animals - Yes we need to save animals. No not in Star Wars right now. The franchise was about building a galaxy that nerds\\, thinkers\\, creative types and people who love the beyond can enjoy\\, then you start shoving earthly issues in the movie it just loses its purpose.\\nExpectations - Fan expectations were so high...Star Wars didn't deliver. \\nPositives - \\nRey. Porgs. More porgs\\, more porgs. They were funny and at least they made me laugh.","true":true}
