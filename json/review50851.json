Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold new direction for Star Wars. It tests us by asking us\\, who can be a hero [anyone]\\, and  what is hope. Led by dynamic performances particularly Adam Driver\\, this sci-fi space epic is in the stars.  Despite some plot holes and canned dialogue the film packs a punch. To the fans who critique it for being different\\, difference is hard\\, but in some cases like this one it works.","true":true}
