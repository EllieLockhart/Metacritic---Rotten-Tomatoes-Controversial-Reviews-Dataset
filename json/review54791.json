Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think its important to say you cannot please every single Star Wars fan at once\\, it is simply impossible. I am the type of fan that likes change\\, so my opinion will not penalize the film because it is not 100% based around the Skywalker family. Without further ado here is one normal college student film major's review of The Last Jedi.\\n\\ncinematically\\, the film was not bad it had its ups and downs but it is immature to say it was a bad movie whatsoever. I did think that it stumbled with its subplots at times\\, in fact I believe one subplot involving Finn and Rose didn't actually need to be in the movie at all\\, they could have ditched that whole side storyline and\\, and maybe showed a bit more of Rey's training with Luke. Rey's character underwent a lot of changes through the movie\\, a few\\, I believe were a bit rushed. According to the timeline just days prior she wanted to \\\"go back to Jakku\\\" and now all of a sudden she wants to help save the galaxy from the first order. Thats all I have for bad things. Now for the good stuff: Mark Hamill was phenomenal\\, I know this has been said by critics and fans alike\\, but to be honest it could not be said enough. His final performance as Luke Skywalker was the highlight of his career (which is saying a lot because his performance as \\\"The Trickster\\\" in the CW Flash show was excellent). Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey was also amazing\\, Im no actor but I know real acting comes when characters have to go through personal emotional journeys\\, rather than physical adventures like flying around\\, going planet to planet in the millennium falcon. Poe Dameron became an actual character in this movie\\, and you find that he is not just some ace pilot but also a big cocky troublemaker who wants to\\, one day lead the resistance. Ive been hearing a lot about how the movie had bad dialogue\\, and I disagree with this one hundred percent. Rian Johnson has knack for the young writing feel\\, meaning it doesn't feel like its being written by middle aged men who don't really know how young people talk in the 21st century. I never cringed at any lines in fact I found a lot of them genuinely funny\\, and not MCU one liner jokes that they every now and again throw in to lighten the mood\\, actual funny stuff. My absolute favorite thing about this movie\\, is that it is opening up something new for the franchise\\, its the change that I think fans are afraid to take but is something that needs to happen if they are going to continue making Star Wars movie outside the Skywalker storyline.","true":true}
