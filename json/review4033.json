Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Box office numbers are misleading. Trailers and professional critics have maliciously lured people into the theaters by cheating about what they would find there. Everyone expected a Star Wars movie\\, that is a movie with the look and feel\\, the mood\\, the magic\\, the lore of the Star Wars universe. This is not what they get at all. Lots of people paid for viewing this movie only to find themselves regretting it bitterly.\\nIf it was possible for those people to get their money back and also subtract their number from the total\\, the box office would amount to maybe one third of what it is now. Most probably less.\\nThe truth will come out as soon as The Last Jedi is distributed as DVD\/Blue Ray. No one will be buying it. Moreover\\, the next installments of the franchise\\, namely Solo and Episode 9 will fail the box office\\, since the vast majority of comments here and elsewhere hint at people not wanting to spend any more money to be trolled and preached by Kathleen Kennedy and poor Rian Johnson\\, who is maybe understanding now how big a mess he has done both to Star Wars and his career.","true":true}
