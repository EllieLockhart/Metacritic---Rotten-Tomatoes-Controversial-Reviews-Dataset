Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is easily the worst one ever in the entire Star Wars franchise. The story is weak and superficial\\, and can essentially be summarized in one sentence. Nothing that explains where Snoke came from and how he could become as powerful as Palpatine in such a short time\\, whereas it took Palpatine a lifetime to get there. The acting performance of Kylo Ren is very weak and amateuristic. The role of Luke Skywalker is disappointing\\, to the point you're almost glad he's finally dead and over with. The so-called \\\"Leia Poppins\\\" scene is just ludicrous and the lowest point in the entire movie. Nothing of the mysteries in episode 7 are properly addressed\\, let alone answered\\, in this movie. If Disney keeps this up\\, they will effectively kill the Star Wars franchise for good. Pity.","true":true}
