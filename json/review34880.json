Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 'fans' dismissing this one seem awfully hard to please. I don't agree with everything that happened\\, but it's only slightly lesser than \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". Your childhood hasn't been ruined unless you let it.","true":true}
