Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty disappointing.  I don't know I've ever seen a movie take 20% of their plot and make it an inconsequential waste of time (Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rose's plan to escape).  It was very unsatisfying to take an iconic character like Luke and turn him in to a \\\"get off my lawn\\\" grumpy old man\\, and then kill him off in a pretty unspectacular fashion.  And why was it impossible to give us any background\/substance for Snoke?  What was the purpose of Rey going to the hole in the ground \\\"dark side of the force\\\"?  Just to see a thousand reflections of herself?  I honestly cannot understand why critics score it so high.  I thought it was pretty close to a disaster.  They better get this franchise figured out soon\\, or people are going to start giving up on them.  Rogue One is the only movie out of the last 6 that holds a candle to the originals....","true":true}
