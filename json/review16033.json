Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan.  Saw \\\"A New Hope\\\" in the theatre when it came out in 1977 and have seen every Star Wars film when released.  This movie was very disappointing.  Not a very cohesive story and was actually kind of dull.  Just a rehash of past stories with nothing new or original to add to the storyline.  The main villain is a crybaby and Luke is made to look like a whiny coward.  This is not one of the best Star Wars movies.","true":true}
