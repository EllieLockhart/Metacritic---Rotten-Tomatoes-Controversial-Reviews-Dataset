Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two words... dumpster fire.  Rian Johnson you ruined star wars. No pay offs from Force Awakens.  Completely undermines the original trilogy. Terrible plot. Breaks so many established star wars logics... Star Destroyers aren't slow!!! The Falcon had to go into an asteroid field when it couldn't go into hyper space to evade them. The very first scene in star wars ever is a star destroyer running down a corellian corvette!! It would be one thing if this miscue was a small oversite\\, but the entire plot is built off it. That's just the tip of the ice berg and I just don't have the energy to go through all the issues with this film. I just don't think even the great JJ Abrams can bring this trilogy back to life. Disney if you think you can keep milking this cash cow with Johnson at the helm you are sadly mistaken and in for a rude awakening.","true":true}
