It's a truly unique game in the way the story is told and I don't think it's told in the best way possible. However I appreciate what they tried to accomplish. The problem is that I didn't always feel the way I knew they wanted me to feel.\r\rTo me this is a unique experience that made going through the game rough at times but I like to think of myself as en open-minded person and I've always wanted to play a game that featured a true anti-hero because I'm tired of all the games where you get to be the hero or villain. This is something else. You're neither the hero nor the villain. You're just going through the story of people in a world that's gone to sh*t. You may not agree with what happens in the story or you may not feel satisfied with the events in the story and I think this is where they tried to do a similar thing as they did in the first game in a different way and it just doesn't work the same way.\r\r*spoiler warning for the first game*\rAt the end of the story Joel goes on a manic rampage instead or saving the human race and undoes everything you've been working towards the entire game and dooms the entire population by doing so. As a player you folow the story and have no say in the decision that Joel makes. Eventhough this rampage is completely immoral and unethical in every possible way\\, you understand where Joel is coming from because the entire game builds up to this moment and this is what makes the story of the first game so memorable.\r\rThis time they tried to switch it around and try something unique and this makes your mind conflict with your feelings. It's a true experience of morality in it's greyest forms and a critical look at the cycle of violence. It's an ambitous project and it might not be for everyone. If you just want to feel like a badass hero saving the world and mindlessly blow up people without having to deal with the consequences\\, you should probably skip this game and play something else. There are a lot of games out there that do not deal with the darker side of violence and war.\r\rI can't help but feel like all games that tried this in the past have been criticized for pushing an agenda while also celebrating the violence they condemn. It might be very hypocritical for a game to do this\\, but by showing two sides of the coin you can actually nuance the celebration of violence and focus on the morality and meaning of it all. I think this games does exactly that and it might not always feel right or wrong\\, but I think that's part of the experience you'll have with this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
