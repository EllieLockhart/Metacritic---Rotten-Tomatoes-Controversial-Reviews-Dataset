Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reposting my review. Rian jhonson should be banned from writing or directing not only starwars movies but any movies at all. This movie is so disrespectful to what the lore is about. The force is basically nothing special anymore for anyone can just use and have it and become stronger than luke skywalker just because. Lame and lazy. I will not watch anymore starwars movies unless they reboot it from ep 7 with the right people and maybe have lucas involved to oversee it and make sure it stays true to what he envisions the saga is about.
