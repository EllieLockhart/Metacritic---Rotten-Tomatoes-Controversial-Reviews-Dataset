Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't really recomend it. Kylo ren was amazing though (he gets 5 stars) I get critics confliction. I saw it out of desire to finish the saga in cinemas. For two hours I was bored\\, but the last 10-20 minutes were ok (whoever did that part - good job but it doesn't redeem wanting to walk out from boredom earlier.. (I loved the prequels\\, tv shows \\, games etc\\, not a huge fan of the new series but I remember people not liking the prequels and how that annoyed me so of you enjoyed the new stuff\\, ie last Jedi..go see it. If not spend your life\/ time more wisely. . Maybe I'm the wrong era now to be interested in star wars.   if you liked the last jedi.you will enjoy it","true":true}
