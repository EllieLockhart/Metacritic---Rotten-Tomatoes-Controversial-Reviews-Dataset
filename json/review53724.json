Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good generic space action film. TERRABLE Star Wars film. We don't know how or why the galaxy is controlled by this first order. Episode 7 basicly rehashed Star Wars 4 just to get people back into the swing of things with a more throw away set of bad guys. It was like the empire but without any major frame. In episode 8\\, we needed some expounding on who the first order is\\, who Snoke is and why should we care? At the end of 6\\, the empire falls. At the beginning of 7\\, we are expected to believe they didn't? Ok fine\\, they will show more of the empire and explain everything further in 8\\, right? WRONG. All the stuff that was set up in the last movie as teasers were ended and answered with lackluster reveals. We are left with 10 or so rebels (really what are they rebelling against) against a baddie that acts like Hayden Christensen playing a mad Aniken Skywaker. Big baby... throwing tantrums. Most new characters are kinda bland. Asian girl is throwaway. Plot all over the place.... at least we know what's going on with the old actors and characters\\, they're being killed off for a new breed. Of mediocrity","true":true}
