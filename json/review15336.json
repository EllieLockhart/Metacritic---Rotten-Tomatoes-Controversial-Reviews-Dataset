Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll give the Last Jedi the benefit of the doubt and say it's a lot better the second time viewing. Although a lot of great films will make you want to rewatch it for the satisfaction of the first viewing\\, the second viewing of the Last Jedi is more of a way for viewers to try and get an answer from their confused first viewing\\, basically.\\nBut the second time through\\, the jokes seem more wholesome\\, moments are more captivating\\, and I'll be honest\\, the plot seemed to make some more sense. Sure it's a rough and long film\\, but having a lot of cliffhangers and unanswered questions is a good thing to set up Episode 9.","true":true}
