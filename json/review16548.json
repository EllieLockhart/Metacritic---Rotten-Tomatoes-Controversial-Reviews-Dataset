Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In any critique\\, I believe it's always important to begin by emphasizing the good things first... Really cool interaction between Rey & Kylo. Enough of the obsequious flattery. This is the worst scripted Star Wars' act & narrative arc of the whole saga. Period. It was rotten by design already way before execution\\, no matter what all the 'new age RT critics' say. But almost no one is pointing at the person truly responsible for this besides Rian Johnson... SHAME ON YOU MRS. KATHLEEN KENNEDY. By approving that specific anticlimatic film ending\\, you just dishonored our fav movie franchise ever.","true":true}
