Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely hugely disappointing!! Lazy director!! Where is the lightsaber duel?? Stupid Snoke coming out from nowhere? Where are the other Knight of Ren? The movie feels like a simple war movie\\, not a Star War movie we used to love!!","true":true}
