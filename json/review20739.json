Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted so bad to like this film\\, and I tried really hard to convince myself it was good. But unfortunately it was the first Star Wars film that I left the theater not wanting to be a Jedi. There is no lore in the film at all. Rian Johnson should have listened to Mark Hamill about who Luke Skywalker is. Also the humor is really poorly timed and there is a scene in the movie that is the worst in Star Wars history.","true":true}
