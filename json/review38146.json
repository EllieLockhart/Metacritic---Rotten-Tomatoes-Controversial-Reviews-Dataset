Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The tenor of this film was completely off-base and inconsistent with the Star Wars mythos. As mentioned elsewhere\\, the narrative is befouled with a political agenda aimed at subverting and emasculating a new generation of viewer in a similar vein that it has extinguished the Jedi. \\n\\nThis dross needs to be stricken and an appropriate version created in which episode VIII is either explained away as a dream sequence from the point of view of C3P0 undergoing a reprogramming and memory wipe or just admittedly a colossal and unforgivable mistake a la Disney that will be rehashed at a later date by a competent writing and directorial team.","true":true}
