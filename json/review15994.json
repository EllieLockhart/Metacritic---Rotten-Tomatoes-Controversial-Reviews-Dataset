Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a fan\\, I really think they did a good job in ending Luke Skywalkers journey. It didn't feel\u200b rushed. the whole movie was fun to watch with some funny parts and also kept you wanting to watch more.","true":true}
