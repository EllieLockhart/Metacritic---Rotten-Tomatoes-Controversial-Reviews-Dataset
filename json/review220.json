It is just absolutely amazing there is no other game that delivers that ultimate badass feeling you get when you fight your way through an entire bulding and dropkick a dude out of a window while epic music plays\\, it is truly a one of a kind and an absolute blast! Yakuza 0 is a prequel to the entire series so it's great for newcomers and long time fans alike. The entire game is 60FPS which makes for very smooth gameplay which  feels great to play. The minigames are tons of fun and addicting especially the cabaret management. The story is absolutely amazing as well as the soundtrack. it is jam packed with so much great content a single play is easily 50-130+ hours of gameplay.  i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fresh revitalizing gaming experience!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
