Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the result of SJW identity politics and giant corporations trying to make art. That\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s what you get- get woke go broke. Will never see anything Star Wars again and the fact that critics give it a 91% shows how paid off they are.","true":true}
