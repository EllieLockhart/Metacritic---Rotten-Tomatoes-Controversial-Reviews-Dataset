Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is two and a half hours you can never get back. It is not a good movie.  Poor story\\,  nice looking film though. i am under the impression that the majority of film critics are giving it positive reviews due to the amount of power and access Disney now holds in the industry. If they decide to blacklist reviewers in the future that don't give good reviews to their ten pole films. This was a bad film\\, i wanted it to be good. It is disappointing with all of the time  available material on Start Wars this was the best story that came out.","true":true}
