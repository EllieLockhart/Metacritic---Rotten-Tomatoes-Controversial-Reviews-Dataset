Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Going into the film\\, I was sort of expecting a clone of Empire Strikes Back. However it instead risks breaking the mold of its predecessor\\, but in a refreshing sort of way. New characters\\, aspects of the force\\, and conflicts makes The Last Jedi a fun and unique entry into the franchise.","true":true}
