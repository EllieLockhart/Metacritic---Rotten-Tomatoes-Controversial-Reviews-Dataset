Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very good movie! Fans are upset about TFA because they took no chances\\, and now they're upset TLJ took to many. Glad they democratized the Force\\, but some of the plot lines were a bit of a stretch\\,  but I think more people are upset their fan theories from TFA are shot down. Great movie has me looking forward to 9.","true":true}
