Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ruined Luke\\, he was not the same person from the originals. Ruined star wars action witth not one light saber striking another for the entire film. Luke went out like such a wuss. Also rotten tomatoes is corrupt this score should be way lower. All ive seen is negative reviews and it holds at 48%","true":true}
