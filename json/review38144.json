Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The teaser promised so much. Links to the past in the shape of Rey's family and possibly Snoke. The possibility that a new balance would be achieved in the force (grey jedi?). The film then progresses to tear down all these interesting possibilities for a boringly familiar good vs evil romp (and not anywhere near as good as previous instalments). Betrayed! Snoke and Kylo are both laughable as bad guys.Even the return of Yoda's force ghost is (for some unknown reason) the jovial joking Yoda Luke first met on Degobah.  I don't know where the reviewers get their ideas. everyone around me in the cinema hated it and there was an eerie silence of disappointment as we left the cinema. at least my expectations for the final instalment will be minimal. So sad after the triumph of Rogue One. Terrible.","true":true}
