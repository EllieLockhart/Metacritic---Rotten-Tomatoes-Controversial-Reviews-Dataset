Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has the BEST visual splendor of any Star Wars film! But\\, it fails to use any of the story setup left by TFA and destroys all continuity of all the preexisting SW Films\\, nor does it leave you with any hope; as this film would have you believe\\, that there is any plan for another installment. This is a film awash with an agenda\\, one painfully evident takes precedence over the telling of a good story; a story that you can see once existed\\, but has been thoroughly eradicated. Without a story there is nothing to drive character progression. Without character progression there is no reason to invest in the characters: new and old. Without that character investment it is hard\\, or impossible\\, to enjoy that visual splendor!","true":true}
