Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mary Poppins in Space? Come on!!!!! A secondary subplot that added nothing to the story\\, a poor second part film to a trilogy. A heroic sacrifice that gets sabotaged  A LOT of man-shaming going on in this film.... we are supposed to belive that Rose is that good at everything? I mean she was a janitor on the freighter! The female leads are bad ass and empowered but the males are written to be arrogant buffoons. I see an unbalanced Social Justice spin to this movie.  The Rose-Finn subplot seemed like filler and anti-capitalist propoganda.","true":true}
