Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is the most poorly constructed Star Wars film since the Prequels. Half of this film could be cut out entirely\\, and the plot would be largely intact. If you want quality Star Wars storytelling\\, watch the original trilogy. If you want CGI violence and large scale battles\\, watch either trilogy. Don't watch this film.","true":true}
