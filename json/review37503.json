{"101487":178278,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some truly captivating visuals in this movie\\, as well as some great performances by the actors. The reason I give it such a low score is due to three things. First\\, the pacing of the movie is dreadful\\, the producers parced this movie up so poorly that there is no build up of tension that leads to any meaningful conclusion. The movie seems to jump randomly from pivotal plot scenes to random comic relief scenes\\, then to scenes that are just filler and bare no weight on the direction of the film. Second\\, the total disregard for a major character like luke skywalker was disgusting. To take such a loved character and turn him into a whiny\\, pathetic\\, self loathing\\, and self absorbed husk of his former self is the greatest disgrace that any director\/writer could have done. they had a truly amazing opportunity to have luke be the Yoda figure to rey\\, teaching her what he had learned from his mistakes and teaching the opposing view from what snoke posits about the balance of the light and dark sides of the force. This being that the light and dark rising to meet each other is meant to be a reference to the balance one must find between the light and the dark within ones own self\\, instead of snokes view that when a strong light side force user appears that a strong dark side user will rise to meet their level of power\\, and vise verse. What a huge missed opportunity. Luke would have been better off dying at the hands of the emperor than being written by Rian Johnson. Third\\, they make the same mistake every franchise does when they lose a beloved cast member\\, the are afraid to kill off the character because they think it disrespects the memory of the lost friend. It seemed that Leia was supposed to die by being sucked out into space\\, then they decided to have a completely absurd scene where leia's corpse\\, which already has ice forming on it\\, uses the force to bring itself back to the ship. after suspending disbelief for that scene they then have leia's character leave with the fleeing members of the resistance as they abandon their carrier\\, and proceed to have a character that means nothing to us sacrifice herself to save the small transport ships as the try to escape. this scene could have been the most amazing send off for leia\\, making her exit from the franchise heart wrenching as well as brutally impactful on the hearts of the audience. What better way to honor Carrie Fisher than to make her character finish the same way she began\\, as a strong leader who was always willing to sacrifice for the good of the rebellion\/resistance\\, and simultaneously making her the hero she was always meant to be. But no\\, we give the hero mantle to a character that is meaningless\\, and we now will no doubtedly get some cringeworthy banter in the next film about how leia died\\, or some pathetic cgi leia death scene that has minimal impact. I could not have a lower opinion of Rian Johnsons writing and directing abilities when it comes to this movie\\, and I will definitely not be going to watch the trilogy of movies he was awarded for this sad excuse for a film.","true":true}
