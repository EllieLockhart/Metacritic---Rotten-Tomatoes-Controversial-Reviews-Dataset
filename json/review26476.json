Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Objectively disappointing. I understand where they were trying to go with this\\, but they failed. Luke\\, Leia\\, Snoke\\, Po\\, Finn\\, Rey\\, Kylo..all their storylines took a turn for the worst. Attempted to be daring and brilliant\\, instead turned out wrong and disrespectful to the lore.","true":true}
