Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some good moments but the middle parts had me thinking about why did I come see this. The Force Unleashed was mehhh so I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. Great ending and visuals through out but the meat of the sandwich tasted a little spoiled.","true":true}
