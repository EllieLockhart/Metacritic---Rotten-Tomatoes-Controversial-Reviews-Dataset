Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were elements in the movie that was great. Such as the attention to details in the background and so forth.\\nHowever\\, there was something not quite right. I guess it is the elements that Disney wanted in the movie to move merchandise. Most of all the Villian \\\"Ren\\\" was not even close to being \\\"Vadar cool swagger\\\"! Over all still an entertaining movie.","true":true}
