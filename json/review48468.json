Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With questionable story decisions that seem to reboot and\/or just wipe clean all 7 previous episodes for the sake of subverting expectations but without delivering anything satisfying instead\\, there was very little for me to enjoy here. With plot threads setup by Force Awakens (2015) cut short and with no explanations to how the universe is in its current state after the of Civil War. The story leads nowhere\\, starting with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys\\, and ending with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys. It fails to treat the original cast of the OT respectfuly\\, and fails to provide the characters setup by Abrams 2 years prior with any meaningful development. Duplicating scenes from \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" and \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" almost frame by frame\\, it feels short out of ideas. A lot of the characters come across a very incompetent\\, and many are misused or almost ignored entirely. The movie's tone is all over the place\\, with some scenes struggling to make sure if they wanna make you feel sad and anxious for the heroes\\, or laughing as if this was a light hearted comedy. More power to those who love the movie. to me\\, it wasn't an enjoyable film\\, even with very low expectations.","true":true}
