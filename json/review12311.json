Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so disappointed in this film. Motivations makes zero sense\\, forced plot that has zero bearing on the movie as a whole. As a lifelong Star Wars fan I haven\u2019t been like this since the prequels. ","true":true}
