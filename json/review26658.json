Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok I had take some time to digest this from the fan event\\, but I think the movie was very good. There were so many surprises. I loved the interaction between Rey and Ben. I loved the humor and the cinematography.","true":true}
