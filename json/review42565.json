Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a social experiment meant to reform acting norms by installing stronger females and removing male influence. Femininity is being \\\"force\\\" fed to us because weak individuals and groups believe masculinity is wrong. Look at how Poe was treated\\, look at Fins story arc etc. There are many examples of this. The new director has created this and we should all be wondering why. I reject this movie wholeheartedly and I now know why Harrison Ford wanted to get out of this sordid affair.","true":true}
