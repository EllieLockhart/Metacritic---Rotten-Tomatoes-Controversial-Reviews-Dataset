Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very polarizing movie because they tried to make it so. Why would you rewrite the ethos of a movie with such a devote fan base? To capture more of a millennial audience? Turned Han Solo into a loser\\, single dad. Killed him. Turn Luke into a loser not capable of anything and completely taking us in a different direction than JJ Abram's set up was for. Killed him. Elevated characters we don't care about with terrible backstories. And the humor... the humor shouldn't have left the Disney channel studios. Very lame and not fitting.","true":true}
