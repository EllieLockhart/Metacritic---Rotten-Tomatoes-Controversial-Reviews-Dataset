Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie suffers from what appears to be some very bad attempts to push political agendas at the expense of trying to tell a story. The characters are unlikable\\, the script is very poor and whole story arcs could be removed with no effect on the movie.  In fact when it came to the end of the movie I was scratching my head - what was the story?  Nothing happened.  It was two and a half hours of a plot that didn't make any sense.  This is the first movie that has ever left me feeling angry.  Why was this plot and script approved?  What you're left with is a very poor generic sci fi movie that only drew an audience based upon its franchise name and viewer expectations.","true":true}
