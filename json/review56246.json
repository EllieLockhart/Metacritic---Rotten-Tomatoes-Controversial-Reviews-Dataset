Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a very off-putting movie.\\nIt doesn't quite feel like a Star Wars movie\\, but it's still fun to watch.\\nI enjoyed the dynamic between Kylo Ren and Rey\\, however Lukes story missed the mark pretty bad.\\nI've seen the movie three time already\\, and it just leaves a funny taste in my mouth each time.\\nMy overall thoughts of episode 8 is that it's the best out of the bad Star Wars movies. It still beast the crap out 'Attack of the Clones'.","true":true}
