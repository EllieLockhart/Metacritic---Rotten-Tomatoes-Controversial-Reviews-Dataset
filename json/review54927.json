Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not too late to get a series reboot halfway through is it? \\n\\nIf an insider told me that Rian Johnson either hated Star Wars\\, or never saw the films\\, it would explain a great deal.  This film is so bad\\, that if you applied one if it's plot holes to the beginning (say a lightspeed attack on the first order in the beginning).  The film could have lasted 10 minutes\\, and the ending result story wise would be relatively the same.\\n\\nThe positive:  The cinematography in this movie is outstanding\\, Kylo Ren's character develops into a solid character\\, and there is an enjoyable Rey\/Ren fight. \\nThen there is the story.... \\n\\nYou know the director was trying too hard when he put the \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\" running gag in a droid language.  He seemingly didn't want to make a Star Wars film\\, but had the hubris to make Star Wars 'his' by destroying it's core\\, and building it up how he wanted it to look.  As a director he can do this\\, and this is what happens when Disney lets a risky director pick write and direct the movie unchecked.\\n\\nNonsensical plot points? Check.\\nRemoving old characters with no reverence for the sagas history? Check.\\nSeemingly no self awareness that it is a middle film?  Check.\\nForced\\, out of place (but still funny) humor?  Check.\\n\\n**slight spoilers**\\nWhat Johnson did to Lukes character was unforgivable if you are star wars fan\\, and explains Hamill's complaints about his character.  \\nAlso\\, please tell me how 1 ship crashing into another destroys every single other ship in the sector\\, but leaves the main characters sitting there just fine in a split ship.  What!?  This\\, One of the most beautiful scenes in cinema\\, is so visually stunning that few even notice how little sense it makes.  Not to even mention why would anyone need death stars or rockets if they can just light speed attack everything.  \\n\\nThat must be what happened before this film\\, because after 30 years\\, the alliance somehow only has 3 ships and around 10 fighters. \\n*******************\\n\\nI didn't know I could leave a star wars movie feeling empty\\, and I have never been able to say 'I don't really care about seeing the next star wars movie' until after this one.  What they have done to this movie genuinely left me feeling downtrodden.\\n\\nIf you are a casual fan\\, you will likely find this movie ok.  If you are a long time fine\\, you may leave angry.  \\n\\nI write this review as I try to write every review. As a fan. And it is obvious that the fans are light years away from the critics on this one.","true":true}
