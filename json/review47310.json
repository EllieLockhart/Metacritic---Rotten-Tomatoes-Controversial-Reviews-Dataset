Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a travesty. Rose's character couldn't act\\, lukes part makes him look like a scared old man who never even bothers leaving the island\\, and snoke gets no backstory and is killed with a parlor trick. How this story was approved is beyond me. Adam driver was good though so props to him","true":true}
