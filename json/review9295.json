Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage.  Total garbage.\\n\\nThere were a few good scenes\\, especially between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, but there were so many flaws that those good parts cannot make up for the rest of this mess.\\n\\nThe biggest problem I had with this movie is that there was no heart or soul to it.  It really didn't go anywhere and definitely didn't make me feel anything beyond disappointment.\\n\\nPlease\\, don't support this film.  The only way to get Disney to revisit the direction of Star Wars is to hurt them financially.","true":true}
