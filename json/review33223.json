Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a wasted opportunity\\, an incredible effort from the technical team and crew can not disguise a poorly written and directed film No regard is given for the star wars ethos or mythology. There is another cut somewhere online that does fix most of the issues and is a much better watch.","true":true}
