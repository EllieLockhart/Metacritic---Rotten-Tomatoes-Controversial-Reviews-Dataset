Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"one of the worst films i have ever watched. star wars is now dead to me. disney have ruined everything that was beautiful about the star wars universe and turned it into a pile of poo. absolutely mind blown how anyone can say this movie is good. \\n first off the special effects are awesome. the music is not too bad either and that's the end of the positives.\\nomg the rest is utter nonsense and cringe worthy. i cannot believe that star wars is dead. and the utter disrespect of the cannon by disney is a travesty.","true":true}
