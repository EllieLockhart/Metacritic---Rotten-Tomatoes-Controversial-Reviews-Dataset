Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many unanswered questions and no real character development for Rey and Finn compared to The Force Awakens. I was disappointed by the many plot holes and some of the choices they made for the story. I still enjoyed the film overall and didn\u2019t find myself bored. But this honestly felt like it could have been Episode 7 1\/2 waiting to get to 8 which would really be proper. Desperately hoping IX will make up for this. ","true":true}
