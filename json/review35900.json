Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the perfect representation of the dark side of the force. And I know a lot of hard core star wars fans are pissed off by this movie but this the star wars movie that I never knew that I heeded.","true":true}
