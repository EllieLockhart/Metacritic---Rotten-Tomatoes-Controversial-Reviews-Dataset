Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely awful. The movie has 'Star Wars' in the title but it is not a Star Wars movie. 'The Last Jedi' isn't a lazy re-hash like 'The Force Awakens' was but its sins are just as bad. Episode 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, and Rogue One are the only Star Wars films that exist\\, while everything else is horrible fan fiction. Good job on killing the Skywalker family and my childhood.","true":true}
