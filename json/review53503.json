Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best movie since Empire. (Although I will admit the scene where a character survives being ejected into space without any protection is completely absurd that doesn\u2019t ruin the whole movie) I understand that some people are upset that the series is in a new direction but after forty years it feels like a breathe of fresh air for the series to change things up. As I stated I do understand how these changes would upset some and it\u2019s fair to say the originals were better movies\\, however you are being completely delusional if you think that any of the prequels were better than this film. This is my first and probably only review I just felt compelled to state that I thoroughly disagree with that opinion and I think some people are just being dramatic and lying to themselves about how good the prequels really were.","true":true}
