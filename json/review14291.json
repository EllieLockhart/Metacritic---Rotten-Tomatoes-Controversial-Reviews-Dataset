Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I got mix feelings but more disappointment.  I was hoping to have more epic lightsaber battles.  Very confusing to see Luke and Snoke die like that... So much more could have been done.","true":true}
