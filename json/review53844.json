Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's a synopsis:\\nOur heroes need to escape a planet so they leave in their fast ship. Good guys play D long enough for fast ship to get away but main good pilot goes rogue to knock out a big bad guy ship. Some good guys die and ship gets away. Pilot gets scolded and then bad guys show up again cause they have better GPS. Clearly\\, someone needs to unplug their GPS so that means it's casino time. Meanwhile good guy ship will drive out of range of bad guy guns but rouge pilot does like this idea so he gets mad at purple hair lady. At the casino the one guy they need they find\\, but then end up in jail\\, so they take that guy cause he seems cool enough. They end up on bad guy ship and unplug their gps but now there is a problem cause there is a black BB8. The casino crew gets captured and talks about weapons sales before purple lady says fuck it and wrecks the ship so bad guys die and good guys escape. Now everyone is on salt planet and it's red underneath. Luke\\, who has been educating Rey on harassing locals and long range phone calls sends his ghost to trick a child who recently became leader of bad guys. Child is tricked\\, good guys get away once again!","true":true}
