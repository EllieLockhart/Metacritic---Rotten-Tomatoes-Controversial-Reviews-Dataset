Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Disney\\, please stop with the musical chairs directing. J.J. Abrams built something interesting in The Force Awakens only to have Rian Johnson to make The Force Went Back to Sleep. Johnson obviously doesn't love his subject material\\, and it shows. Self righteous tinkering isn't needed\\, just tell a cohesive story! If I accept this movie\\, then everything that happened in The Force Awakens\\, and even in the original trilogy\\, doesn't matter anymore\\, which I don't. Hopefully the next film will be a home run and I can just pretend this one doesn't exist. ","true":true}
