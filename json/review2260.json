Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A top 5 lightsaber dual\\, beautifully shot space battles\\, and quite possibly my favorite Star Wars relationship dynamic in Rey and Kylo are almost all but forgotten in the most pointless addition to Star Wars to date.","true":true}
