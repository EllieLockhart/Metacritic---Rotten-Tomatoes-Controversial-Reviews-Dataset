Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the very first time\\, I felt the need to sign up\\, so that I can add my rating\\, and write a little something. At this point it must be said that I grew up watching Star Wars\\, and I've been a huge fan of the franchise for years. I really wanted Rian and the gang to succeed in making the best Star Wars movie\\, but as much as it pains me to say it - they failed. \\n\\nI know it must be hard to hear and read\\, as I know for a fact - a lot of the people involved in making those movies are fans themselves\\, but having seen it twice already I feel it would be better for the future of Star Wars if everyone including the studio started thinking of TLJ the same way we think about the infamous holiday special\\, and that is to forget it ever existed.\\nGranted\\, TLJ is well made from a technical standpoint\\, which can't be said about the holiday special\\, and certainly more redeeming qualities in other areas (e.g. Adam Driver) but that doesn't change the fact that I wish I could wake up tomorrow thinking that the saga could still be heading in a direction I might care about. \\n\\nKathleen Kennedy must go\\, that's the bottom line.\\nStudio nearly completely ruined Gareth Edward's Rogue One\\, and it seems to be happening again with the Han Solo spinoff as we speak\\, and then she happily signed off on TLJ... \\n\\nI also agree with what another user wrote\\, and couldn't possible phrase it any better:\\n\\\"Disney needs to stop shoving its obnoxious social agenda down our throats ruining a classic franchise. Know your audience\\, Disney.\u00a0\\\"","true":true}
