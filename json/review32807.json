Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was quite possibly the worst Star Wars film ever created.  It barely relates to episode 7\\, the plot holes are unbearable\\, and they ruined both Luke and Leia.  I left the theater in utter shock and still cannot believe this is an actual Star Wars movie.  The only reason it gets one star is because it was well shot and the music is amazing.  The story and characters\\, however\\, are terrible.","true":true}
