Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The list of problems with this movie is a mile long.  Rian Johnson should stay out of star wars.  His understanding of the star wars universe is poor\\, and his decision to use it to push his personal views on a variety of subjects outside the scope of this type of movie is infuriating.","true":true}
