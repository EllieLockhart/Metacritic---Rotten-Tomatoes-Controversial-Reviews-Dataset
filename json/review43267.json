Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a complete disgrace to anyone who cares about the mythos of Star Wars and the established rules of this universe. RJ's tactics of \\\"subversion\\\" are a thinly veiled attempt to \\\"...let three past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" It was a poorly written political piece that brought nothing new or exciting to a film franchise that so many people love.","true":true}
