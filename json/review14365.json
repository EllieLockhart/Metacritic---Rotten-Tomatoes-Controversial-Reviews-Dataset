Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had a good time with this latest installment\\, there are plenty of moments from this film that I enjoyed. It's by no means perfect\\, the canto byte sequence is kinda meh and maybe something could have been done with how the main plot was a very long chase sequence\\, but I liked the themes and I like the characters.","true":true}
