Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They should have called this movie - the Character Assassination of Luke Skywalker.  The idea that they would ignore Mark Hamill's input and go so out of their way to disrespect the original series was the most amazing display of arrogance and downright mean spiritedness that I have ever seen in mainstream production.  In general I'm fine with the new characters\\, I am opposed to the trashing of the old characters.  I decided to review the movie because I discovered that Rotten Tomatoes popcorn score should actually be more like 24%\\, not what it is now (46% at the time of this writing)\\, I decided to weigh in and try to move the score closer to reality.","true":true}
