Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie on its own it is ok and kind of enjoyable although there is a lot of bad writing\\, many plotholes and bad characters like General Weasley and Kylo Ren\\, but as a Star Wars movie it is total garbage.","true":true}
