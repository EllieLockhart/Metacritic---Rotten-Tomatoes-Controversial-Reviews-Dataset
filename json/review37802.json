Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were many moments in the movie where I thought ok things are going to get better now ... but they never did. It was very disappointing. The entire movie seemed like it was cramming the entire original trilogy into 2 and half hours.","true":true}
