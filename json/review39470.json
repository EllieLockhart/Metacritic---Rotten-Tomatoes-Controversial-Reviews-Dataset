{"101487":181222,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film really gets better after a second viewing. It's a good movie - just not necessarily a good Star Wars movie.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I am not a bot. Nor do I hate diversity - I loved it in this film and TFA. I am\\, however\\, a \\\"fanboy\\\"\\, but not a misogynist racist neo-Nazi like some of the critics out there would have you believe.\\n\\nThis film has been discussed ad infinitum all over the Internet\\, so let's get straight to it:\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\nPlenty to like about this film. George Lucas was right that it was \\\"beautifully filmed\\\" - breathtaking vistas\\, Crait\\, Holdo's lightspeed jump - the excellent filmography continues from Rogue One. The acting was good too - Mark Hamill gives the performance of his career (even if his Luke wasn't true to character) and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver have improved tons from TFA. I loved Yoda - puppet Yoda being silly was still in character\\, in my opinion\\, and his lines make sense. I have no problem believing that the most powerful Jedi ever can call down lightning even as a Force ghost. Also Luke Force-projecting at the end wasn't new - Yoda did it first in the animated Star Wars Rebels. And even though I have complaints about Luke\\, that final duel was badass.\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\nLet's do a little thought experiment. Go rewatch the throne room scene in Return of the Jedi. Watch Luke slice Vader's hand off and then catch himself. See him throw his lightsaber away and tell the Emperor \\\"I am a Jedi\\, like my father before me\\\". He refused to kill the second most evil man in the galaxy - and that faith turns Vader back to the light side. Now watch TLJ. Can you really believe that this same Luke would raise a lightsaber against his sleeping nephew\\, Leia's son? \\n\\nNow you have the reason most fans are disappointed about Luke's portrayal - TLJ Luke isn't Luke. He would maybe mope about for a while\\, but there's no way in Jabba's arse that he wouldn't come back to help Leia. Rey and R2 knew it too - they used Leia to try and persuade Luke\\, and the Luke of the original trilogy put his family and friends over everything else. Him dying at the end\\, while poignant\\, also could have been better written - I felt an iconic character like Luke Skywalker deserved better overall.\\n\\nWasted villains are a cardinal sin to me. Snoke was wasted - I understand he had to die\\, but that could have been done so much better. Completely unrealistic how he is built up to be such a powerful Force user and doesn't see the betrayal coming even though he is LITERALLY READING KYLO'S MIND AT THE TIME. Phasma appears on screen\\, is badass - then dies unceremoniously after forgetting how to use a gun on Finn. Hux\\, once actually menacing and ambitious in TFA\\, is reduced to Monty Python levels of comedy here. And the entire First Order appears incompetent - how did they even conquer the galaxy between TFA and this film? At least Lucas did proper worldbuilding in his prequels.\\n\\nTHE VERDICT:\\nPerhaps the most chilling thing about The Last Jedi is how well Disney can control the media narrative. Film critics are a finicky bunch - it's suspicious how they have all unanimously lined up to sing praises about The Last Jedi. This has not gone unnoticed - commenters at The Guardian have asked why their usually picky film critics left glowing reviews without any faults\\, the Angry Joe Show recanted their criticism after posting a 2-million-view video ranting about TLJ's problems\\, and for every article correctly pointing out that TLJ is underperforming for a Star Wars movie\\, there are 10 more saying how it's raking in billions at the box office and how it's God's gift to cinema\\, etc etc. Even The Phantom Menace got some good reviews initially - so when ALL the critics line up in one choir to praise a film to the heavens\\, you know something fishy's going on.\\n\\nIn the end\\, it's our right to like or dislike a film - and just because some people dislike this one doesn't mean we should be ridiculed or talked down to\\, especially not when we've supported the franchise for decades.","true":true}
