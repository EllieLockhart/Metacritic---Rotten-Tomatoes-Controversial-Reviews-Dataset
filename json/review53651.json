Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all that episodes 1 and 2 had boring characters (some more so than others) and bad dialogue\\, at least the plot was unfamiliar. This movie suffered from the same Episode 1 and 2 problems at the same time that the plot felt like a repeat of things we had seen before. I found myself predicting a lot of it\\, and it felt like a drag. I actually wanted to check the time on my phone several times and found myself wondering repeatedly when it would just end. I can count on one hand the number of times that has happened to me in a theater. Lots of people are ragging on about the political overtones -- and yes\\, it kind of gets shoved down your throat in a way that's annoying\\, but I'm pretty much used to that by now -- but the point is it's a bad movie even if you set aside all the political messaging. It's just a DRAG. The only reason I'm giving it one star instead of a half a star is there were two things I could kind of\\, sort of\\, appreciate about it: 1) some of the interaction between Kylo Res and Rey felt genuine and even (dare I say it) convincingly emotional\\, although I personally think they messed up how that ended\\, and 2) I can appreciate the message in the movie that sometimes the rash run and act plan of action is not as good as the less heroic seeming proposal proposed by all the older wise people. I don't think it really worked in this context for this movie\\, but I can appreciate a movie trying to make the point that sometimes the old\\, experienced folks actually do know what's best and running off on crazy heroics sometimes is really stupid\\, even if that's what good movies are made of a lot of time. But again\\, I don't think it works here. And before any SJW rips me for saying any of this\\, I am a young female Millennial. I don't think that should make a difference\\, but apparently it does.","true":true}
