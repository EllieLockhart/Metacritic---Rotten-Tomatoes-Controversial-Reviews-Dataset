Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably the worst movie from all the saga\\, it appears that it was made to troll all the fan theories or made \\\"shocking\\\" twists just for the sake of it\\, not really because of a coherent reason or natural progression from the previous movies\\, character wise\\, or even comedic wise. Luke its made here a complete waste of character and is a disgrace for the whole star wars community and fandom from the old days specially\\, i'm sorry for Mark Hamill he was asked to go through this\\, you can feel he was not happy in a looooot of youtube videos he talks about this. Luke was extremely disrespected and wasted in the most incredibly ultra super way possible in this joke of a movie. Such a potential for the sake of \\\"twists\\\" or trolling the fandom. This is the greatest mess in star wars i've ever seen. Just no\\, they should remove this from canon. Episode 9 cant fix all of this garbage\\, it just cant. Star Wars is finished i'll pretend this never happened haha.","true":true}
