Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an oddly-shaped Star Wars movie that largely squanders the cast of the original trilogy\\, and the potential of several of its newer characters. A needless subplot\\, overlong coda\\, and some ill-judged comedy take up too much of its running time\\, and Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern look like they've wandered in from a different movie. There are plus points\\, including the intriguing relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey\\, a touching reunion between Luke and Leia\\, and a calamitous mid-space collision\\, but these moments are not enough to keep Episode VIII from being a disappointment.","true":true}
