Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars ever. Prequels are starting to look good now. A lot of pointless characters introduced in Force Awakens apparently for no reason. Pointless casino scene. Pointless love interest for Finn. Pointless training for Rey. Pointless\\, pointless\\, pointless movie. Storyline has progressed to rebels are basically obliterated\\, Rey has become a Jedi without any training and Luke dies for no reason\\, the end.\\n\\nPointless movie in a galaxy far far away","true":true}
