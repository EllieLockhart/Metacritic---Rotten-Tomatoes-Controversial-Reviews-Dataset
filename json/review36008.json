{"101487":175644,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi : Review\\n\\nLet's start off with some pre-nuptials before we get into this messy divorce. Yes\\, I am a white man from Ohio. And yes\\, I saw Star Wars at the age of merely 7\\, and was\\, along with all the other 7 year olds\\, entranced and amazed at what I saw. Luke became my hero\\, the Star Wars universe was my playground\\, and I gleefully went along on the ride at the near-perfect age for such a thing. \\n\\nA New Hope at 7\\, Empire at 10\\, ROTJ at 13\\, when I was old enough to stop caring about the toys\\, I had gleaned everything I needed from Luke ( I related\\, living in a small town and having my eyes on \\\"faraway places\\\") and although I always kept a little fire in my heart for Star Wars stuff\\, i was ready to let it go at that point\\, more or less. \\n\\nI was the target demographic and it got me. Now\\,  you may be inclined to take my opinion with your own grains of salt and pepper because i'm an \\\"old school\\\" fan\\, but you'll soon see why you might be wrong on that front. Because the original Star Wars - from here on out we'll call it \\\"A New Hope\\\" even though it was just Star Wars to us - was undeniably a great\\, classic movie on the highest level of moviemaking as an art form. Some people called it silly\\, others were put off by the creatures and some goofy dialogue\\, but at its core\\, it was a fairy tale\\, and then a fairy tale turned into a visual spectacle\\, which then touched millions of people. \\n\\nWe don't recall it now\\, but the movie did things movies had never done with the special effects\\, and it was beautifully couched in the classic redemption and adventure stories that are as old as civilization. For the arc of these three movies\\, George Lucas was an auteur\\, a brilliant storyteller\\, and a visionary filmmaker. He had a great idea and followed through on it like a champ.\\n\\nI can't even discuss the prequels. George lost his way there - like it or not. The films aren't good. The stories are confusing\\, none of it matters anyways\\, and he \\\"overtold\\\" the story. Way too much information\\, way too much backstory\\, went back too far into Anakin history\\, explained everything way too much. They were three movies of silliness that never needed to happen. That said\\, they were Star Wars movies ;  fun to watch that first time\\, then\\, not so much. Adding to that\\, everyone pretty much knew where it was all headed ( final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin\\, of which we already knew the result) so there was no way to have many surprises - theoretically\\, if you showed the Phantom Menace to a 7 year old\\, he\/ she might wonder who Palpatine\/ Sidious was\\, but if you had already showed them the original trilogy\\, even that mild reveal ( that Palpatine becomes the Emperor) is taken away. I could write and write and write about how bad the prequels are\\, and I wish with all my heart that were never made. But that can be another essay.\\n\\nThe prequels were unnecessary. Prequels that had gone further back and showed lots of cool ancient Jedi stuff\\, or showing how Siths came to be and Jedis learning force powers\\, etc.\\, would have been way cooler\\, and maybe that third movie moved us closer to Anakin and the Skywalkers... but I digress. If anyone from Lucasfilm\/ Disney read this\\, I've got a whole new set of prequels to pitch you - and they're awesome. \\n\\nNow we have arrived in the new era. George relented and sold the whole franchise to Disney\\, and we get not only the final 3 of the trilogy\\, but a whole bunch more movies to come\\, new storylines\\, new characters\\, new Jedis\\, new Sith. It will be kind of cool\\, having an endless run of Star Wars movies coming at us indefinitely\\, and also a little sad. Because the original \\\"fairy tale\\\" of Luke and his journey was so strong and simple\\, that to continue it on indefinitely\\, is going to dilute it\\, badly. And that's what The Last Jedi did. \\n\\nBefore I get into the specifics\\, however\\, let's talk about movies just a bit. We all like to talk about the stories that movies tell\\, and movies are an art form in and of themselves. So for example\\, it's probably a good thing that there were not 8 more Wizard Of Oz movies\\, after the original Wizard of Oz ( even though there were plenty of books). The movie is a complete work\\, it tells a lovely story with great visuals and characters and mystery and magic\\, and THAT'S IT. There's no more story to Dorothy or the Tin Man or any of them. Same with all the Kurosawa movies that George loves so much and was so inspired by. The Hidden Fortress\\, the Seven Samurai - these are one time affairs\\, even though there was plenty more to go on\\, if one wanted. Why didn't Kurosawa make the Hidden Fortress 2 and so forth - ? Because often\\, more often than not\\, great movies should be left as stand alone works. \\n\\nTheres no sequel to E.T. because Spielberg knows it would not match the original ( although\\, i would not be surprised if in this new era\\, someone makes one sometime soon). Many film-gurus will disagree and point out some other good runs of movies ( Indiana Jones\\, Terminator\\, and so forth) where it was more or less pulled off.  Mad Max franchise\\, X Mens are all pretty solid. They've got it down to a science now - a pre-planned science - but Star Wars may have been the last truly definitive blockbuster of the analog age. And even though he wasn't able to plan any sequels at the time\\,  George got lucky \/ was smart.\\n\\nHe set up A New Hope perfectly. Had there been no interest for more\\, it was a great ending. We never know what happens to Darth Vader at the end after he spins away and are left to wonder for ourselves\\, Luke saves the day\\, and that's it. By the way\\, this is how we all felt after A New Hope. We didn't know a sequel was coming for a couple years. So we loved our Star Wars\\, and were happy with it. When Empire was announced\\, it was like \\\"whhaaaaaaaaa???\\\" - and that's where history really started to change. \\n\\nBut my point here is this : New Hope\\, Empire and ROTJ - told a complete story. To continue that story without staying true to its basic morals and the characters' redemption that they achieved within it\\, denigrates all of them. \\n\\nAnd here's where we can get into the Last Jedi\\, and to some degree Force Awakens. Tsk tsk Disney\\, JJ\\, Johnson. Tsk tsk tsk tsk.\\n\\nForce Awakens was fun. I liked it. I like Rey. Finn's likable as well. I am down with the the general idea of Kylo Ren\\, more or less. Nice to see some of the old gang. They sold out Han Solo however. Simple question : would Han Solo\\, ace smuggler and space pirate\\, knowing that he had two fugitives and a droid that the First Order was looking for on the Millennium Falcon\\, march them all into a public place like Maz Kanata's bar  ( literally filled with gangsters) only to be seen by another seedy person and immediately called in? Thanks to Han Solo\\, and nobody else\\, Maz Kanata's whole place was wrecked\\, countless people died\\, and Rey was taken prisoner by Kylo Ren. Way to go\\, Han!\\n\\nNo\\, of course the real Han Solo would never do that\\, but J.J. Abrams was too lazy to think up some way around that and the people at Disney told him he needed another \\\"Cantina\\\". So\\, he sold out Han\\, turned him into a bumbler who failed to foresee this obvious possibility\\, and moved his story forward. That's just pure laziness. I also don't believe Han Solo would walk out onto a gangway over an infinitely deep chasm to confront his son - or anybody for that matter\\, unless he had a death wish\\, and the Han Solo I know\\, never had a death wish. So again\\, it was a nicely lit scene\\, but it made no sense. People change\\, but not that much. This version of Han Solo wanted to give up and die and was fine with lots of other people dying too. Not buying it. That's all an insult to the complete bad-ass Han Solo was in the first three movies. Swooped in\\, saved the guy who was saving everybody else\\, and ended up with the girl\\, all the while dealing with the price on his head and his own whole world of problems. \\n\\nLots of other things in Force Awakens didn't really make sense\\, but I gave a lot of it a pass. I am quite confident that the people at Disney told J.J.:  don't make these movies for the 40 year old white guys\\, make it for today's 7 year olds. So it's fine if you repeat the motifs and story line of A New Hope. Start off on a desert planet with some cute new character - how about a girl\\, that's a wild idea! and end up blowing up a big battle station. Totally fine. Nobody will hold it against you\\, and we don't care about the people that do. Just make it really good and exciting and do your best with the Han Solo \/ Luke \/ Leia stuff. Harrison Ford only will do one movie\\, so kill him off somehow\\, and make it about his kid or something who had gone bad. Stick with the formula\\, JJ! \\n\\nSo\\, he did. And it's a nice movie\\, very Star Wars-ish. Lots of things don't add up\\, but we can let most of it slide. It was funny watching everyone wonder \\\"who is Snoke\\\" ? Who are Reys' parents? Asking all these questions. We never cared who the Emperor was when Empire came out - it was just like \\\"He's really evil and creepy\\, and awesomely mysterious\\\". We never cared\\, even when we knew that Vader was Luke's father\\, who his mother was - I mean who she personally was. It was a  nice mystery to have - who could Darth Vader possibly have been married to and had kids with? And of course those \\\"nice little mysteries\\\" that A New Hope was so good at imparting were all mercilessly answered to death by the prequels. Mysteries\\, no more. Darth Vader built C3PO! Midichlorians! Gag. George\\, george\\, george. Now we know that Queen Amidala  is Luke & Leia's mom. Sigh. It was way cooler when she was\\, as Leia described\\, just a feeling. \\n\\nSo JJ was intentionally trying really hard to put some of those new mysteries in Force Awakens\\, but they all kinda fell flat. I still don't know what the Kessel Run is\\, and i love that. But I don't really care where Maz got Luke's lightsaber. It's just not that compelling\\, and clearly\\, JJ doesn't know either\\, and it doesn't matter. The little mysteries trick doesn't work over and over.\\n\\nNow\\, let's talk about this latest mess\\, the Last Jedi. Again - fun movie to watch. And maybe that's all i should expect from it. I liked it more the second time\\, and in some ways less the second time. But I think the movie itself is symbolic of a deep sickness in modern society\\, and I'll explain that in a moment. \\n\\nThe first big problem with Last Jedi can  be summed up in one word : Motivations. What makes A New Hope ( and other classic adventure movies) so great\\, is that the motivations of the characters are really clear and simple and relatable\\, and usually\\, there's some kind of redemption involved. In just the course of a New Hope\\, Luke goes from farm boy who wants an adventure to farm boy who gets an adventure. He loses his mentor\\, Obi Wan\\, who has imparted a few valuable lessons to him\\, before he has a chance to really get to know him\\, and this makes him want to avenge Obi Wans' death\\, another quest ( and we all are with him\\, we can't believe Obi Wan is gone so soon at the hands of this black suited villain) . Han Solo starts off saying \\\" I don't give a shit about your rebellion\\\" then comes back at the end and saves Luke from being shot down by Vader - Han Solo has his own very clear and believable redemption arc in the movie. Leia loses her WHOLE PLANET and is able to avenge that by seeing the Death Star destroyed along with Grand Moff Tarkin\\, who was really the most evil person to her in that film. Obi Wan's motivation is to show the Force to Luke and demonstrate with his actions how serious it is that he understand his potential. The rebellion's motivations are clear. Everyone has a strong motivating factor. And everybody gets a ribbon and a smile at the end from the beautiful princess. Fairy tale! \\n\\nWhat are the motivations of all these new characters\\, exactly? Rey : wants to stay on Jakku and wait for her parents to come back - that's about it. She ends up having Jedi master-like powers totally out of the blue\\, but even in The Last Jedi is not clear what to do about it\\, basically saying \\\"someone tell me my place in all this\\\" - All what\\, Rey? If you want to go back to Jakku\\, just go. \\n\\n How about Finn- it was a nice motivator in the very beginning - get out of the First Order because it's \\\"the right thing to do\\\". But after that\\, what? In Last Jedi he tries to split to find Rey. He obviously has a thing for Rey  - is that his only motivation? Because I'm not getting much else from him. He was basically ready to split the \\\"resistance\\\" permanently at the first chance he got - i don't think he is that interested in being a \\\"resistance soldier\\\" and really only does it because Rose forces him to. Right? Anything else seem that interesting about Finn? He also suddenly knew how to use a lightsaber and stuff\\, but that didn't mean anything. \\n\\nHow about Poe Dameron? Hotshot pilot\\, cool. That's fine and a nice thing to have in a Star Wars film. Where's his character headed? He doesn't seem to do anything that well except fly an X Wing. He meanders around the Last Jedi failing at everything\\, pretty much\\, and providing comic relief\\, which is really unfortunate. His whole \\\"mutiny\\\" falls flat and seems like a really strange plot device that doesn't really accomplish anything\\, and then he \\\"leads\\\" the battle on Crait but they fail too\\, falling back at the last minute and not even taking out the big gun they were aiming at. I expect he'll be equally \\\"side manned\\\" in the next film. \\n\\nKylo Ren - ok\\, he has a motivation. He wants to be really bad like Darth Vader and \\\"rule the galaxy\\\" - but he is so obsessed with Luke - and it's funny\\, because if he was really that bad of a guy or wanted to be\\, he'd be perfectly happy to have Luke living in exile somewhere and never coming back. Why go chasing after him- ? What's the point? Isn't kind of nice\\, if you're the First Order\\, to have the only Jedi in existence in permanent self-exile? Luke certainly didn't stop the First Order from destroying all those Republic planets with their Starkiller weapon\\, did he now? Seems like Luke was safely out of the way. If i'm Kylo Ren\\,  let him rot\\, I say!\\n\\n**On the quick subject of the Starkiller base\\, a small point. If the Starkiller base sucks all the life out of a star\\, then uses the power of that star to blow up the planets that were orbiting the star - doesn't destroying the star make all the planets die out because they no longer have a sun? Just something to think about ( it makes no sense).  Because in the movie they were all in the same vicinity when this all happened. Planets can't \\\"live\\\" without a sun. Why blow them up? Everyone would just freeze to death which is way more evil\\, added bonus. Kind of a stupid premise. \\n\\nBack to motivations. So Kylo Ren is just obsessed with Luke and that's about it. It's kind of a weak motivation for someone who wants to \\\"rule the galaxy\\\". Let Luke wither away\\, and go ahead and rule the galaxy\\, he's not interfering at all. If JJ and Johnson hadn't totally mucked up Luke's true character\\, he never would have allowed the First Order to get so powerful to begin with. The real Luke would have been hounding the First Order from day one and THEY would be on the run. Now that would have been an interesting plot.\\n\\nEven the First Order seems really confused in the Last Jedi. The jokey moments in the movie around the First Order were just absolutely cringeworthy\\, and I can prove it:  In A New Hope\\, Grand Moff Tarkin never has any bullshit slapstick moments. He brings Leia in\\, lies to her\\, tricks her\\, makes her watch while he destroys her home planet - MILLIONS OF PEOPLE including everyone she's ever known and loved. And then sentences her to death. That's evil incarnate. Nothing is more evil. And you feel it\\, in the movie\\,  it's rough stuff. It's as rough as the burning corpses of Owen and Beru. Really awful.  He's totally cold and heartless in every way. Jokes not necessary. \\n\\nIn contrast\\, Huxes' facial posturing in Last Jedi are so silly and cartoonish\\, he may as well have had smoke coming out of his ears and a little angels and devils on his shoulders. And all the one liners and jokes just totally deflate their power as something \\\"evil\\\". They just seem like they are playing at being the Empire. Embarrassing. \\n\\nPsychic Texting : apparently Snoke \\\"connected\\\" Kylo and Rey in this manner to mess with their heads. It smacks of two teenagers texting with each other and wondering if they should hold hands. Terrible move\\, in my humble opinion. I guess it might work for the junior high kids\\, although the junior high kids I know thought it was kinda dumb. And then she \\\"gives herself up\\\" in a scene that I suppose was meant to kind of harken to when Luke gave himself up to the Emperor. But in that case\\, so much was at stake- Luke's whole character arc was in its final passionate moments. His one look at the lightsaber when the Emperor is prodding him on\\, he's really fighting the urge to \\\"go dark\\\"- and eventually does! He gives in to the dark side\\, defeats Vader\\, and then is about to be defeated and killed by the Emperor himself right in front of his own father. That's really heavy stuff.   Rey\\, on the other hand\\, was fighting nothing\\, and nothing to gain by showing up\\, and really not much to lose either. In this case\\, Rey was pretty much guaranteed to die or be imprisoned when she gives herself up. \\n\\nDid she really have that much faith in Kylo Ren? So she was risking it all based on his \\\"psychic texts\\\" which could have easily been a ruse? Is she that stupid or naive? And then\\, of course\\, she accomplished nothing. Snoke's dead\\, she leaves. Now Kylo Rens' in charge. What did she accomplish with her visit there? What was accomplished for the story? The Emperor had Vader totally under his spell and Vader really went deep to finally do away with him - the Emperor was about to kill his only son. Heavy stuff.  Snoke\\, did not have Kylo Ren under much of a spell. So Kylo just got rid of him. Anything crucial to the story going on here? \\n\\nIt was cool to see the Falcon's escape pod when Rey gets in it - thats nice. And of course that whole fight scene with the guards was awesome. But we could have had awesome scenes along with an awesome story that made sense and let us have some investment in the characters. \\n\\nWho is Snoke? Who cares ? We never really cared who the Emperor was\\, as I said. But because JJ presented Snoke as this modern day gollum-ish CGI phantasm\\, he basically made everyone wonder who it was. And then they just burned the question down. Lame. Bad choice. And\\, they made everyone wonder who Reys parents are. Thats fine. And they connected her to Luke's lightsaber and her \\\"force visions\\\" had her hearing from Obi Wan\\, Yoda\\, and seeing what Luke saw in Empire.  Again\\, Laziness\\, through and through. \\n\\nThat's JJ saying \\\"Lets have her hear Ben's voice and see Luke's Empire battle and stuff\\, that'll be cool and nobody will know what to think of it\\\". He was right\\, but it was totally pointless. Obviously she has the force and can be a Jedi if she wants. Do all potential Jedi have lightsabers call out to them and hear Obi Wan and Yoda and see Luke's old battlegrounds? Or just her? If only her\\, why? No reason? That's not a good reason. And neither is nostalgia for A New Hope. If you want to burn down the past\\, at least do it well\\, do it in a way that creates cool new questions\\, not just confuses things. \\n\\nEven if some surprise is coming in episode IX regarding Reys parentage\\, it almost doesn't matter anymore. They made it matter too much to begin with\\, and now it's kind of non-issue. Oh she's Obi Wans lost sisters kid? Cool. She's a Kenobi! Yay\\, that's neat. Honestly it makes no difference - they kind of ruined the moment for it to mean something by teasing it so hard. Maybe her and Kylo are brother and sister? Yawn. Whatever it is\\, it can't be a surprise at this point. The mistake was to set her up so closely to Luke and all that to begin with. Honestly\\, it would have been better just to leave Luke and Han and Leia out of these movies entirely - so much less complicated\\, and we could just roll along with a  new set of characters. Oh well. Too late now!\\n\\nNow lets discuss the big Kahuna here\\, Luke Skywalker. People can call this movie subversive all they want. \\\"let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" says Kylo Ren. Ok - I'm all for that. It's nice to let go of nostalgia. If Rian Johnson's plan was to subvert Star Wars for all of us \\\"OG\\\" viewers so that we wouldn't be nostalgic or give a shit about it anymore\\, he may have just accomplished that. \\n\\nBecause\\, as Mark Hamill said\\, \\\"It's just a movie\\\". But I disagree with Mark a little there. It's more than just a movie. And besides that\\, everything is just something. The earth is just a planet. The Mona Lisa is just a painting. The Beatles are just a rock band. Ok\\, that's one way to look at things. But A New Hope\\, whether George or Mark or JJ or Rian like it or not\\, actually did inspire a lot of people and was more than \\\"just a movie\\\". \\n\\nIn the late 1970's  the divorce rate was something crazy high - a lot of kids growing up without both parents - myself included. A weird sense of malaise and \\\"fake\\\" ness was coming through the culture. A lot of disco music\\, corny TV shows\\, strange post-Vietnam political landscape and weird coming of the 80's Republican age. And Star Wars had this incredibly imaginative hook to it that allowed not only the 2 hours of escapism while the movie played\\, but much more escapism after that. Knowing it was ok to wonder about your father and why he wasn't around. Knowing you could trust in a kindly old wise person who wants to teach you things about being a good person. Knowing to trust your instincts\\, to look up\\, to look around\\, to get rid of fear and embrace change and embrace your true desires. These were the lessons of Luke Skywalker\\, and he came through all of it. He fought himself\\, he trained with Yoda\\, he confronted his father\\, and he redeemed him. He redeemed himself and his father. Good wins\\, stay on the side of good no matter what. Good lessons\\, i think. \\n\\nI seriously wonder if Rian Johnson sat down and watched the first three movies before making the Last Jedi. Reminded himself of how powerful Luke's journey was\\, and can continue to be to people as they watch these films.\\n\\nBecause the Luke in the Last Jedi - was a total failure ( until the very end). He was jaded and grouchy and out of it. He didn't need to be that way. The only reason Rian Johnson did that was to intentionally\\, without any really good cause other than for the sake of itself\\, \\\"subvert\\\" the character. Luke may have had trouble with Kylo Ren - may have lost faith. Sure. But he wouldn't leave millions of people to die at the hands of the First Order. He wouldn't turn away someone powerful in the force holding his old lightsaber that he last saw when battling Darth Vader. Luke would do the right thing\\, and he wouldn't be afraid. \\n\\nAnd I suppose the idea is that between Yoda and Rey\\, they somehow \\\"redeemed\\\" Luke to come back to the Force - ? So that's all it took? So Yoda was chilling in the Force this whole time\\, watching the First Order slaughter millions of people and run rampant\\, and then he's like \\\"hey Luke\\, don't be like that\\\". That's it? I don't buy it for a second. Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda are inherently good - and wise. They are Jedis\\, protectors of peace. Yoda would have been on Luke so fast as soon as he got to Acht-To saying\\, \\\"Luke\\, you ain't quitting now\\, there's bad stuff coming\\, you need to help out\\\". And by the way\\, so would Obi Wan\\, and Anakin\\, who also had force ghosts but apparently never bothered to visit Luke\\, which I don't buy. Obi Wan was right there in Empire. He would have come back and spoken with Luke if Luke tried to bail on the force. Yes\\, he would have.  That's what Obi Wan does. Obi Wan just doesn't just disappear. It hurts him when innocent people die. So if he could have force ghosted to Luke to get him back on track\\, he would have. And I don't believe for a second that he tried and that Luke just refused. They just decided to have Luke be ignored by all of them until we showed up to see the movie\\, and\\, clap-clap - there's Yoda being sorta weird and crotchety like he was in Phantom Menace\\, and not at all wise and wizardly like he was in Empire. Lame. \\n\\nI can't even get into how silly the whole \\\"chase\\\" plot device was with the resistance ships and the Empire ships that apparently couldn't get \\\"close enough\\\" - that makes no sense at all\\, and Princess Leia's \\\"force move\\\" was pretty weak too. There were a million cooler ways to do that. She would have put a force bubble around her and Akbar and all of them and saved them all\\, not just flown through space like Mary Poppins. Lazy. Or she would have diverted the laser fire in space to miss her. Or spoken with Kylo Ren through the force. Lots of cool ways to handle her finally showing some real Force power\\, but what they chose was just..weak. And the whole subplot to the Casino planet.. please. Really? There's a Las Vegas casino in space? And they park in the wrong place and get arrested for it? And then randomly meet a guy who can crack anything even the Emperor Snoke's Starship with some stuff in his pocket?  Sorry - too far fetched\\, unnecessary\\, and I'm pretty sure Disney sat Johnson down and said : \\\"Look Rian\\, we need some kids in this movie. And some animal creatures to ride around on. Figure it out. \\\". So he cooked up that whole diversion just to make sure some animals and kids made the cut. Really weird diversion\\, and then a failed mission on top of it all. And then Benicio Del Toros' character not only sells them out\\, but is then personally responsible for most of the Resistance being wiped out. His character wasn't evil enough to do that\\, yet he still did. Just doesn't add up- guys like him might do dumb things\\, but they aren't just pure evil. When you have all these \\\"huge\\\" amounts of deaths\\, we don't feel their impact. That's why Owen and Beru was so hard to watch. In these movies\\, people do dumb  things and lots of nameless\\, faceless people die\\, and we don't even really care. \\n\\nJohnson left too much of the good stuff out and added too much of his own stuff. He tried to \\\"subvert\\\" it and failed. He treated The Last Jedi like it was just another episode of Game Of Thrones. Someone dies\\, someone lives\\, it doesn't really matter\\, there will be a zillion more episodes\\, so just watch it and forget about it. By the time it's all over you won't remember any of the details\\, so just be stoked on a few cool scenes and move on with your life. \\n\\nOur culture has become so shallow\\, so fast-paced\\, so \\\"binge oriented\\\" that there's no time anymore for anyone to make a movie like this that has depth\\, complexity\\, meaning or stays true to its core values. Because there are no more core values in mass entertainment.\\n\\nPeople don't really sense anymore what's right or wrong ( ok\\, a grand overstatement\\, but it's my essay). Reality TV and binge watching and binge social media has taken over. Pornography is bigger than all movies and video games. It's the Trump Age. It's just cheeseburgers and cable tv. It's \\\"grab em by the pussy\\\" and \\\"who has more money\\\". Its TV shows pitting people against each other and playing on people's vices and fears. The Dark Side\\, it seems is here. These are the messages going out to the kids these days\\, folks\\, and it's pretty scary. The innocence of A New Hope may seem quaint now\\, but it was awfully nice to have. And we could have had a little of it here - something positive. But Johnson decided it was time to \\\"kill the past\\\"\\, so he killed Luke\\, and created a whole bunch of other chaotic nonsense that pretty much rules out all the things that Obi Wan ever said\\, which to me is the ultimate crime. And no\\, one kid at the end with a little force power doesn't make up for all the rest of it. That's way too easy. That kid could've appeared anywhere in this movie with his broom and it would have had the same effect\\, probably cooler if it wasn't given such weight as the final scene. \\n\\nWhen you're seven and you meet Obi Wan\\, who is essentially an updated version of Gandalf\\, you have impressed on you that an elderly man ( or woman) can guide and give you good\\, rich advice and philosophy about how to live and how to be. And then he sacrifices himself for the cause. Of course\\, Luke does that at the end of Last Jedi - and that was an amazing idea and a killer ending to the movie - but we could have gotten there without all the other crap we didn't need. Johnson decided it was more important to \\\"kill the past\\\" than to honor it or update it cleverly. Showing some new young force kids - that's fine. But I'm pretty sure we all agree that in the Star Wars universe\\, the Force will be strong in some people. Clearly Rey has it in spades\\, and is just randomly connected to Luke for no reason\\, but isn't she then just a \\\"random force kid\\\"\\, basically\\, who ended up in the middle of the resistance efforts because BB8 stumbled her way? Or is she somehow more important? These guys need to make up their mind - is it a story\\, or is it just random stuff cobbled together ? Because the story isn't really making much sense at the moment and I don't see how it's going to. It's fun having Chewie back\\, but isn't even Chewie kinda over it all this point? \\n\\nGeorge Lucas didn't \\\"kill the past\\\" when he made a New Hope. He updated it. Takes a lot more brains and cleverness to do it that way. And \\\"killing the past\\\" just for the sake of killing the past\\, well\\, again- why?  It's frustrating\\, because \\, really that's the only thing Johnson set out to do. It's like he said  \\\"i'm gonna just cut up everything A New Hope stood for and make it MY way\\\". Ok - that's fine. But who is Rian Johnson and why is he in charge of it for this movie? Just a question. I feel like he didn't really take it too seriously\\, and while anybody reading this probably thinks i'm taking it way too seriously\\, i'm actually not. If this was a fan film\\, made by a fan who wants to do it his way\\, then it's totally fine. But if it's going to be part of the \\\"canon\\\" then I think it should stick with some of the basic tenets that made the first one so great- not just the Star Wars stuff\\, but the \\\"movie\\\" stuff. Plots should make sense\\, motivations should be clear\\, characters should have really good reasons for doing the things they do. A New Hope\\, despite all the fantasy\\, makes perfect sense. Everyone's desires and motivations are clear and they act on them and things happen. This isn't subversion of that paradigm - it's amateurism.\\nIt's called \\\" I can't write and direct a classic film\\, so I'll take the easy way out and make the \\\"ANTI-CLASSIC\\\". Like a kid at the talent show who has no real talent but figures out he can just run around naked on the stage and everyone will laugh\\, maybe even harder than at the kid who works up something actually funny. I guess it works in the short term\\, but in the long term\\, this movie ain't gonna last. \\n\\nThis is basically a Star Wars movie for 2018 bingewatchers - it flies right by\\, lots of stuff happens\\, and .. whatever. Nothing about any of the characters is particularly memorable or inspiring\\, nobody really knows why they are doing anything\\, and the whole thing is basically a long instagram post. It's far closer to Phantom Menace than anybody realizes.  You get your one awesome Luke moment and basically have to take that as the only meaningful thing that happens. And i'm such an idealist\\, I still want Luke to be my hero\\, that I'll sit through the whole thing again just to have Luke back and awesome for a few precious minutes. But man.. did it have to go down this way? This unfulfilling\\, confusing\\, way? Is it possible that George Lucas really did spend 6 or 7 years developing a great story and these guys just piled all their shit together in a few months to carry it on\\, and it didn't work so well 'cause maybe it's not as easy as George made it look?\\n\\nAnd someone at Disney sat Johnson down and said \\\"Oooh\\, we love how you're going to subvert this and do all those funny wacky things you're talking about\\, yeah great\\, it will do a billion dollars no matter what\\, but something we need is a cute little animal with really big eyes\\, it's kind of a Disney thing\\, so just make sure that's in there\\, mmmkay?\\\"\\n\\nAll this said\\, It's a fun ride\\, I guess. And then it's over\\, and you're left with very little to ponder. And I suppose asking any more of it is maybe asking too much because in 2018\\, maybe nothing really matters anymore. We've got too much of everything. Too much TV\\, too much internet\\, too many Star Wars\\, too much. Too much of everything.  We're up to our necks in anything that has ever sold\\, and will be\\, forever. \\n\\nIn my book\\, A New Hope did set a standard - and this movie does not live up to that standard. Even Force Awakens\\, with all the issues\\,  gets sorta close just by way of repeating the formula. But Last Jedi is just an episodic version run by someone kinda reckless\\, and the art of how the movie lands and lives forward is lesser for it. It really just a space soap opera at this point\\, and everybody's pretty one dimensional in it. Alec Guinness was just the best Obi-Wan\\, struggling and sacrificing and so rich with depth. And now\\,  all the  new actors and everyone having anything to do with it will be buying multi million dollar homes in Hawaii with all our money\\, and the rest of us have to just live with what they give us\\, whether it's great or just so-so. Lame. Can I have my money back - not just for Last Jedi tickets - but all of it? For all the Star Wars stuff I've ever bought? Cause I think maybe i've been tricked. I thought George wanted to tell a story of how good wins\\, but apparently\\, \\\"good\\\" sells a franchise to Disney for 5 billion dollars and lets other people trample it to death. What's George buying with those 5 billion dollars ? Hot Pockets? 30\\,000 Ferrari Testarossas?  500 Boeing 747s?  Thousands of raw diamonds? Nuclear Weapons? Real estate in Mumbai? What does one do with 5 billion dollars? \\n\\nI truly wish George had just kept the franchise\\, grabbed a camera and some new people\\, and gone back to Tunisia with his wonky sets and some costumes and kept digging into the gold of his original raw material\\, with a limited budget. We'd have better movies for it. \\n\\nNow\\, I realize i've been awfully critical at this point. And I have one more theory. Maybe Rian Johnson is pulling a big fat Jedi Mind Trick on all of us\\, and mostly\\, everyone that grew up with Star Wars. Maybe he would read this review and say \\\"Exactly\\, dude\\\". He'd say \\\"I did it all on purpose because it's time not just to kill the past\\, but it's time for the whole Star Wars universe to be taken way less seriously and time to start ignoring anything that happened in A New Hope\\, Empire\\, or Jedi. Those movies were a million years ago and the world has changed. It's a \\\"Game of Thrones\\\" meets Disney world\\, and this movie reflects that\\, and just because Luke was your hero doesn't mean he's anybody's hero now\\\". Maybe Rian Johnson is much much more sophisticated than I'm giving him credit for\\, and this movie has philosophical underpinnings so deep that I can't quite wrap my head around them\\, because i'm an idealistic kid from the 1970's who wants today's world to be less of a shit-storm of superficial nonsense. \\n\\nMaybe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Last Jedi : Review\\n\\nLet's start off with some pre-nuptials before we get into this messy divorce. Yes\\, I am a white man from Ohio. And yes\\, I saw Star Wars at the age of merely 7\\, and was\\, along with all the other 7 year olds\\, entranced and amazed at what I saw. Luke became my hero\\, the Star Wars universe was my playground\\, and I gleefully went along on the ride at the near-perfect age for such a thing. \\n\\nA New Hope at 7\\, Empire at 10\\, ROTJ at 13\\, when I was old enough to stop caring about the toys\\, I had gleaned everything I needed from Luke ( I related\\, living in a small town and having my eyes on \\\"faraway places\\\") and although I always kept a little fire in my heart for Star Wars stuff\\, i was ready to let it go at that point\\, more or less. \\n\\nI was the target demographic and it got me. Now\\,  you may be inclined to take my opinion with your own grains of salt and pepper because i'm an \\\"old school\\\" fan\\, but you'll soon see why you might be wrong on that front. Because the original Star Wars - from here on out we'll call it \\\"A New Hope\\\" even though it was just Star Wars to us - was undeniably a great\\, classic movie on the highest level of moviemaking as an art form. Some people called it silly\\, others were put off by the creatures and some goofy dialogue\\, but at its core\\, it was a fairy tale\\, and then a fairy tale turned into a visual spectacle\\, which then touched millions of people. \\n\\nWe don't recall it now\\, but the movie did things movies had never done with the special effects\\, and it was beautifully couched in the classic redemption and adventure stories that are as old as civilization. For the arc of these three movies\\, George Lucas was an auteur\\, a brilliant storyteller\\, and a visionary filmmaker. He had a great idea and followed through on it like a champ.\\n\\nI can't even discuss the prequels. George lost his way there - like it or not. The films aren't good. The stories are confusing\\, none of it matters anyways\\, and he \\\"overtold\\\" the story. Way too much information\\, way too much backstory\\, went back too far into Anakin history\\, explained everything way too much. They were three movies of silliness that never needed to happen. That said\\, they were Star Wars movies ;  fun to watch that first time\\, then\\, not so much. Adding to that\\, everyone pretty much knew where it was all headed ( final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin\\, of which we already knew the result) so there was no way to have many surprises - theoretically\\, if you showed the Phantom Menace to a 7 year old\\, he\/ she might wonder who Palpatine\/ Sidious was\\, but if you had already showed them the original trilogy\\, even that mild reveal ( that Palpatine becomes the Emperor) is taken away. I could write and write and write about how bad the prequels are\\, and I wish with all my heart that were never made. But that can be another essay.\\n\\nThe prequels were unnecessary. Prequels that had gone further back and showed lots of cool ancient Jedi stuff\\, or showing how Siths came to be and Jedis learning force powers\\, etc.\\, would have been way cooler\\, and maybe that third movie moved us closer to Anakin and the Skywalkers... but I digress. If anyone from Lucasfilm\/ Disney read this\\, I've got a whole new set of prequels to pitch you - and they're awesome. \\n\\nNow we have arrived in the new era. George relented and sold the whole franchise to Disney\\, and we get not only the final 3 of the trilogy\\, but a whole bunch more movies to come\\, new storylines\\, new characters\\, new Jedis\\, new Sith. It will be kind of cool\\, having an endless run of Star Wars movies coming at us indefinitely\\, and also a little sad. Because the original \\\"fairy tale\\\" of Luke and his journey was so strong and simple\\, that to continue it on indefinitely\\, is going to dilute it\\, badly. And that's what The Last Jedi did. \\n\\nBefore I get into the specifics\\, however\\, let's talk about movies just a bit. We all like to talk about the stories that movies tell\\, and movies are an art form in and of themselves. So for example\\, it's probably a good thing that there were not 8 more Wizard Of Oz movies\\, after the original Wizard of Oz ( even though there were plenty of books). The movie is a complete work\\, it tells a lovely story with great visuals and characters and mystery and magic\\, and THAT'S IT. There's no more story to Dorothy or the Tin Man or any of them. Same with all the Kurosawa movies that George loves so much and was so inspired by. The Hidden Fortress\\, the Seven Samurai - these are one time affairs\\, even though there was plenty more to go on\\, if one wanted. Why didn't Kurosawa make the Hidden Fortress 2 and so forth - ? Because often\\, more often than not\\, great movies should be left as stand alone works. \\n\\nTheres no sequel to E.T. because Spielberg knows it would not match the original ( although\\, i would not be surprised if in this new era\\, someone makes one sometime soon). Many film-gurus will disagree and point out some other good runs of movies ( Indiana Jones\\, Terminator\\, and so forth) where it was more or less pulled off.  Mad Max franchise\\, X Mens are all pretty solid. They've got it down to a science now - a pre-planned science - but Star Wars may have been the last truly definitive blockbuster of the analog age. And even though he wasn't able to plan any sequels at the time\\,  George got lucky \/ was smart.\\n\\nHe set up A New Hope perfectly. Had there been no interest for more\\, it was a great ending. We never know what happens to Darth Vader at the end after he spins away and are left to wonder for ourselves\\, Luke saves the day\\, and that's it. By the way\\, this is how we all felt after A New Hope. We didn't know a sequel was coming for a couple years. So we loved our Star Wars\\, and were happy with it. When Empire was announced\\, it was like \\\"whhaaaaaaaaa???\\\" - and that's where history really started to change. \\n\\nBut my point here is this : New Hope\\, Empire and ROTJ - told a complete story. To continue that story without staying true to its basic morals and the characters' redemption that they achieved within it\\, denigrates all of them. \\n\\nAnd here's where we can get into the Last Jedi\\, and to some degree Force Awakens. Tsk tsk Disney\\, JJ\\, Johnson. Tsk tsk tsk tsk.\\n\\nForce Awakens was fun. I liked it. I like Rey. Finn's likable as well. I am down with the the general idea of Kylo Ren\\, more or less. Nice to see some of the old gang. They sold out Han Solo however. Simple question : would Han Solo\\, ace smuggler and space pirate\\, knowing that he had two fugitives and a droid that the First Order was looking for on the Millennium Falcon\\, march them all into a public place like Maz Kanata's bar  ( literally filled with gangsters) only to be seen by another seedy person and immediately called in? Thanks to Han Solo\\, and nobody else\\, Maz Kanata's whole place was wrecked\\, countless people died\\, and Rey was taken prisoner by Kylo Ren. Way to go\\, Han!\\n\\nNo\\, of course the real Han Solo would never do that\\, but J.J. Abrams was too lazy to think up some way around that and the people at Disney told him he needed another \\\"Cantina\\\". So\\, he sold out Han\\, turned him into a bumbler who failed to foresee this obvious possibility\\, and moved his story forward. That's just pure laziness. I also don't believe Han Solo would walk out onto a gangway over an infinitely deep chasm to confront his son - or anybody for that matter\\, unless he had a death wish\\, and the Han Solo I know\\, never had a death wish. So again\\, it was a nicely lit scene\\, but it made no sense. People change\\, but not that much. This version of Han Solo wanted to give up and die and was fine with lots of other people dying too. Not buying it. That's all an insult to the complete bad-ass Han Solo was in the first three movies. Swooped in\\, saved the guy who was saving everybody else\\, and ended up with the girl\\, all the while dealing with the price on his head and his own whole world of problems. \\n\\nLots of other things in Force Awakens didn't really make sense\\, but I gave a lot of it a pass. I am quite confident that the people at Disney told J.J.:  don't make these movies for the 40 year old white guys\\, make it for today's 7 year olds. So it's fine if you repeat the motifs and story line of A New Hope. Start off on a desert planet with some cute new character - how about a girl\\, that's a wild idea! and end up blowing up a big battle station. Totally fine. Nobody will hold it against you\\, and we don't care about the people that do. Just make it really good and exciting and do your best with the Han Solo \/ Luke \/ Leia stuff. Harrison Ford only will do one movie\\, so kill him off somehow\\, and make it about his kid or something who had gone bad. Stick with the formula\\, JJ! \\n\\nSo\\, he did. And it's a nice movie\\, very Star Wars-ish. Lots of things don't add up\\, but we can let most of it slide. It was funny watching everyone wonder \\\"who is Snoke\\\" ? Who are Reys' parents? Asking all these questions. We never cared who the Emperor was when Empire came out - it was just like \\\"He's really evil and creepy\\, and awesomely mysterious\\\". We never cared\\, even when we knew that Vader was Luke's father\\, who his mother was - I mean who she personally was. It was a  nice mystery to have - who could Darth Vader possibly have been married to and had kids with? And of course those \\\"nice little mysteries\\\" that A New Hope was so good at imparting were all mercilessly answered to death by the prequels. Mysteries\\, no more. Darth Vader built C3PO! Midichlorians! Gag. George\\, george\\, george. Now we know that Queen Amidala  is Luke & Leia's mom. Sigh. It was way cooler when she was\\, as Leia described\\, just a feeling. \\n\\nSo JJ was intentionally trying really hard to put some of those new mysteries in Force Awakens\\, but they all kinda fell flat. I still don't know what the Kessel Run is\\, and i love that. But I don't really care where Maz got Luke's lightsaber. It's just not that compelling\\, and clearly\\, JJ doesn't know either\\, and it doesn't matter. The little mysteries trick doesn't work over and over.\\n\\nNow\\, let's talk about this latest mess\\, the Last Jedi. Again - fun movie to watch. And maybe that's all i should expect from it. I liked it more the second time\\, and in some ways less the second time. But I think the movie itself is symbolic of a deep sickness in modern society\\, and I'll explain that in a moment. \\n\\nThe first big problem with Last Jedi can  be summed up in one word : Motivations. What makes A New Hope ( and other classic adventure movies) so great\\, is that the motivations of the characters are really clear and simple and relatable\\, and usually\\, there's some kind of redemption involved. In just the course of a New Hope\\, Luke goes from farm boy who wants an adventure to farm boy who gets an adventure. He loses his mentor\\, Obi Wan\\, who has imparted a few valuable lessons to him\\, before he has a chance to really get to know him\\, and this makes him want to avenge Obi Wans' death\\, another quest ( and we all are with him\\, we can't believe Obi Wan is gone so soon at the hands of this black suited villain) . Han Solo starts off saying \\\" I don't give a shit about your rebellion\\\" then comes back at the end and saves Luke from being shot down by Vader - Han Solo has his own very clear and believable redemption arc in the movie. Leia loses her WHOLE PLANET and is able to avenge that by seeing the Death Star destroyed along with Grand Moff Tarkin\\, who was really the most evil person to her in that film. Obi Wan's motivation is to show the Force to Luke and demonstrate with his actions how serious it is that he understand his potential. The rebellion's motivations are clear. Everyone has a strong motivating factor. And everybody gets a ribbon and a smile at the end from the beautiful princess. Fairy tale! \\n\\nWhat are the motivations of all these new characters\\, exactly? Rey : wants to stay on Jakku and wait for her parents to come back - that's about it. She ends up having Jedi master-like powers totally out of the blue\\, but even in The Last Jedi is not clear what to do about it\\, basically saying \\\"someone tell me my place in all this\\\" - All what\\, Rey? If you want to go back to Jakku\\, just go. \\n\\n How about Finn- it was a nice motivator in the very beginning - get out of the First Order because it's \\\"the right thing to do\\\". But after that\\, what? In Last Jedi he tries to split to find Rey. He obviously has a thing for Rey  - is that his only motivation? Because I'm not getting much else from him. He was basically ready to split the \\\"resistance\\\" permanently at the first chance he got - i don't think he is that interested in being a \\\"resistance soldier\\\" and really only does it because Rose forces him to. Right? Anything else seem that interesting about Finn? He also suddenly knew how to use a lightsaber and stuff\\, but that didn't mean anything. \\n\\nHow about Poe Dameron? Hotshot pilot\\, cool. That's fine and a nice thing to have in a Star Wars film. Where's his character headed? He doesn't seem to do anything that well except fly an X Wing. He meanders around the Last Jedi failing at everything\\, pretty much\\, and providing comic relief\\, which is really unfortunate. His whole \\\"mutiny\\\" falls flat and seems like a really strange plot device that doesn't really accomplish anything\\, and then he \\\"leads\\\" the battle on Crait but they fail too\\, falling back at the last minute and not even taking out the big gun they were aiming at. I expect he'll be equally \\\"side manned\\\" in the next film. \\n\\nKylo Ren - ok\\, he has a motivation. He wants to be really bad like Darth Vader and \\\"rule the galaxy\\\" - but he is so obsessed with Luke - and it's funny\\, because if he was really that bad of a guy or wanted to be\\, he'd be perfectly happy to have Luke living in exile somewhere and never coming back. Why go chasing after him- ? What's the point? Isn't kind of nice\\, if you're the First Order\\, to have the only Jedi in existence in permanent self-exile? Luke certainly didn't stop the First Order from destroying all those Republic planets with their Starkiller weapon\\, did he now? Seems like Luke was safely out of the way. If i'm Kylo Ren\\,  let him rot\\, I say!\\n\\n**On the quick subject of the Starkiller base\\, a small point. If the Starkiller base sucks all the life out of a star\\, then uses the power of that star to blow up the planets that were orbiting the star - doesn't destroying the star make all the planets die out because they no longer have a sun? Just something to think about ( it makes no sense).  Because in the movie they were all in the same vicinity when this all happened. Planets can't \\\"live\\\" without a sun. Why blow them up? Everyone would just freeze to death which is way more evil\\, added bonus. Kind of a stupid premise. \\n\\nBack to motivations. So Kylo Ren is just obsessed with Luke and that's about it. It's kind of a weak motivation for someone who wants to \\\"rule the galaxy\\\". Let Luke wither away\\, and go ahead and rule the galaxy\\, he's not interfering at all. If JJ and Johnson hadn't totally mucked up Luke's true character\\, he never would have allowed the First Order to get so powerful to begin with. The real Luke would have been hounding the First Order from day one and THEY would be on the run. Now that would have been an interesting plot.\\n\\nEven the First Order seems really confused in the Last Jedi. The jokey moments in the movie around the First Order were just absolutely cringeworthy\\, and I can prove it:  In A New Hope\\, Grand Moff Tarkin never has any bullshit slapstick moments. He brings Leia in\\, lies to her\\, tricks her\\, makes her watch while he destroys her home planet - MILLIONS OF PEOPLE including everyone she's ever known and loved. And then sentences her to death. That's evil incarnate. Nothing is more evil. And you feel it\\, in the movie\\,  it's rough stuff. It's as rough as the burning corpses of Owen and Beru. Really awful.  He's totally cold and heartless in every way. Jokes not necessary. \\n\\nIn contrast\\, Huxes' facial posturing in Last Jedi are so silly and cartoonish\\, he may as well have had smoke coming out of his ears and a little angels and devils on his shoulders. And all the one liners and jokes just totally deflate their power as something \\\"evil\\\". They just seem like they are playing at being the Empire. Embarrassing. \\n\\nPsychic Texting : apparently Snoke \\\"connected\\\" Kylo and Rey in this manner to mess with their heads. It smacks of two teenagers texting with each other and wondering if they should hold hands. Terrible move\\, in my humble opinion. I guess it might work for the junior high kids\\, although the junior high kids I know thought it was kinda dumb. And then she \\\"gives herself up\\\" in a scene that I suppose was meant to kind of harken to when Luke gave himself up to the Emperor. But in that case\\, so much was at stake- Luke's whole character arc was in its final passionate moments. His one look at the lightsaber when the Emperor is prodding him on\\, he's really fighting the urge to \\\"go dark\\\"- and eventually does! He gives in to the dark side\\, defeats Vader\\, and then is about to be defeated and killed by the Emperor himself right in front of his own father. That's really heavy stuff.   Rey\\, on the other hand\\, was fighting nothing\\, and nothing to gain by showing up\\, and really not much to lose either. In this case\\, Rey was pretty much guaranteed to die or be imprisoned when she gives herself up. \\n\\nDid she really have that much faith in Kylo Ren? So she was risking it all based on his \\\"psychic texts\\\" which could have easily been a ruse? Is she that stupid or naive? And then\\, of course\\, she accomplished nothing. Snoke's dead\\, she leaves. Now Kylo Rens' in charge. What did she accomplish with her visit there? What was accomplished for the story? The Emperor had Vader totally under his spell and Vader really went deep to finally do away with him - the Emperor was about to kill his only son. Heavy stuff.  Snoke\\, did not have Kylo Ren under much of a spell. So Kylo just got rid of him. Anything crucial to the story going on here? \\n\\nIt was cool to see the Falcon's escape pod when Rey gets in it - thats nice. And of course that whole fight scene with the guards was awesome. But we could have had awesome scenes along with an awesome story that made sense and let us have some investment in the characters. \\n\\nWho is Snoke? Who cares ? We never really cared who the Emperor was\\, as I said. But because JJ presented Snoke as this modern day gollum-ish CGI phantasm\\, he basically made everyone wonder who it was. And then they just burned the question down. Lame. Bad choice. And\\, they made everyone wonder who Reys parents are. Thats fine. And they connected her to Luke's lightsaber and her \\\"force visions\\\" had her hearing from Obi Wan\\, Yoda\\, and seeing what Luke saw in Empire.  Again\\, Laziness\\, through and through. \\n\\nThat's JJ saying \\\"Lets have her hear Ben's voice and see Luke's Empire battle and stuff\\, that'll be cool and nobody will know what to think of it\\\". He was right\\, but it was totally pointless. Obviously she has the force and can be a Jedi if she wants. Do all potential Jedi have lightsabers call out to them and hear Obi Wan and Yoda and see Luke's old battlegrounds? Or just her? If only her\\, why? No reason? That's not a good reason. And neither is nostalgia for A New Hope. If you want to burn down the past\\, at least do it well\\, do it in a way that creates cool new questions\\, not just confuses things. \\n\\nEven if some surprise is coming in episode IX regarding Reys parentage\\, it almost doesn't matter anymore. They made it matter too much to begin with\\, and now it's kind of non-issue. Oh she's Obi Wans lost sisters kid? Cool. She's a Kenobi! Yay\\, that's neat. Honestly it makes no difference - they kind of ruined the moment for it to mean something by teasing it so hard. Maybe her and Kylo are brother and sister? Yawn. Whatever it is\\, it can't be a surprise at this point. The mistake was to set her up so closely to Luke and all that to begin with. Honestly\\, it would have been better just to leave Luke and Han and Leia out of these movies entirely - so much less complicated\\, and we could just roll along with a  new set of characters. Oh well. Too late now!\\n\\nNow lets discuss the big Kahuna here\\, Luke Skywalker. People can call this movie subversive all they want. \\\"let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" says Kylo Ren. Ok - I'm all for that. It's nice to let go of nostalgia. If Rian Johnson's plan was to subvert Star Wars for all of us \\\"OG\\\" viewers so that we wouldn't be nostalgic or give a shit about it anymore\\, he may have just accomplished that. \\n\\nBecause\\, as Mark Hamill said\\, \\\"It's just a movie\\\". But I disagree with Mark a little there. It's more than just a movie. And besides that\\, everything is just something. The earth is just a planet. The Mona Lisa is just a painting. The Beatles are just a rock band. Ok\\, that's one way to look at things. But A New Hope\\, whether George or Mark or JJ or Rian like it or not\\, actually did inspire a lot of people and was more than \\\"just a movie\\\". \\n\\nIn the late 1970's  the divorce rate was something crazy high - a lot of kids growing up without both parents - myself included. A weird sense of malaise and \\\"fake\\\" ness was coming through the culture. A lot of disco music\\, corny TV shows\\, strange post-Vietnam political landscape and weird coming of the 80's Republican age. And Star Wars had this incredibly imaginative hook to it that allowed not only the 2 hours of escapism while the movie played\\, but much more escapism after that. Knowing it was ok to wonder about your father and why he wasn't around. Knowing you could trust in a kindly old wise person who wants to teach you things about being a good person. Knowing to trust your instincts\\, to look up\\, to look around\\, to get rid of fear and embrace change and embrace your true desires. These were the lessons of Luke Skywalker\\, and he came through all of it. He fought himself\\, he trained with Yoda\\, he confronted his father\\, and he redeemed him. He redeemed himself and his father. Good wins\\, stay on the side of good no matter what. Good lessons\\, i think. \\n\\nI seriously wonder if Rian Johnson sat down and watched the first three movies before making the Last Jedi. Reminded himself of how powerful Luke's journey was\\, and can continue to be to people as they watch these films.\\n\\nBecause the Luke in the Last Jedi - was a total failure ( until the very end). He was jaded and grouchy and out of it. He didn't need to be that way. The only reason Rian Johnson did that was to intentionally\\, without any really good cause other than for the sake of itself\\, \\\"subvert\\\" the character. Luke may have had trouble with Kylo Ren - may have lost faith. Sure. But he wouldn't leave millions of people to die at the hands of the First Order. He wouldn't turn away someone powerful in the force holding his old lightsaber that he last saw when battling Darth Vader. Luke would do the right thing\\, and he wouldn't be afraid. \\n\\nAnd I suppose the idea is that between Yoda and Rey\\, they somehow \\\"redeemed\\\" Luke to come back to the Force - ? So that's all it took? So Yoda was chilling in the Force this whole time\\, watching the First Order slaughter millions of people and run rampant\\, and then he's like \\\"hey Luke\\, don't be like that\\\". That's it? I don't buy it for a second. Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda are inherently good - and wise. They are Jedis\\, protectors of peace. Yoda would have been on Luke so fast as soon as he got to Acht-To saying\\, \\\"Luke\\, you ain't quitting now\\, there's bad stuff coming\\, you need to help out\\\". And by the way\\, so would Obi Wan\\, and Anakin\\, who also had force ghosts but apparently never bothered to visit Luke\\, which I don't buy. Obi Wan was right there in Empire. He would have come back and spoken with Luke if Luke tried to bail on the force. Yes\\, he would have.  That's what Obi Wan does. Obi Wan just doesn't just disappear. It hurts him when innocent people die. So if he could have force ghosted to Luke to get him back on track\\, he would have. And I don't believe for a second that he tried and that Luke just refused. They just decided to have Luke be ignored by all of them until we showed up to see the movie\\, and\\, clap-clap - there's Yoda being sorta weird and crotchety like he was in Phantom Menace\\, and not at all wise and wizardly like he was in Empire. Lame. \\n\\nI can't even get into how silly the whole \\\"chase\\\" plot device was with the resistance ships and the Empire ships that apparently couldn't get \\\"close enough\\\" - that makes no sense at all\\, and Princess Leia's \\\"force move\\\" was pretty weak too. There were a million cooler ways to do that. She would have put a force bubble around her and Akbar and all of them and saved them all\\, not just flown through space like Mary Poppins. Lazy. Or she would have diverted the laser fire in space to miss her. Or spoken with Kylo Ren through the force. Lots of cool ways to handle her finally showing some real Force power\\, but what they chose was just..weak. And the whole subplot to the Casino planet.. please. Really? There's a Las Vegas casino in space? And they park in the wrong place and get arrested for it? And then randomly meet a guy who can crack anything even the Emperor Snoke's Starship with some stuff in his pocket?  Sorry - too far fetched\\, unnecessary\\, and I'm pretty sure Disney sat Johnson down and said : \\\"Look Rian\\, we need some kids in this movie. And some animal creatures to ride around on. Figure it out. \\\". So he cooked up that whole diversion just to make sure some animals and kids made the cut. Really weird diversion\\, and then a failed mission on top of it all. And then Benicio Del Toros' character not only sells them out\\, but is then personally responsible for most of the Resistance being wiped out. His character wasn't evil enough to do that\\, yet he still did. Just doesn't add up- guys like him might do dumb things\\, but they aren't just pure evil. When you have all these \\\"huge\\\" amounts of deaths\\, we don't feel their impact. That's why Owen and Beru was so hard to watch. In these movies\\, people do dumb  things and lots of nameless\\, faceless people die\\, and we don't even really care. \\n\\nJohnson left too much of the good stuff out and added too much of his own stuff. He tried to \\\"subvert\\\" it and failed. He treated The Last Jedi like it was just another episode of Game Of Thrones. Someone dies\\, someone lives\\, it doesn't really matter\\, there will be a zillion more episodes\\, so just watch it and forget about it. By the time it's all over you won't remember any of the details\\, so just be stoked on a few cool scenes and move on with your life. \\n\\nOur culture has become so shallow\\, so fast-paced\\, so \\\"binge oriented\\\" that there's no time anymore for anyone to make a movie like this that has depth\\, complexity\\, meaning or stays true to its core values. Because there are no more core values in mass entertainment.\\n\\nPeople don't really sense anymore what's right or wrong ( ok\\, a grand overstatement\\, but it's my essay). Reality TV and binge watching and binge social media has taken over. Pornography is bigger than all movies and video games. It's the Trump Age. It's just cheeseburgers and cable tv. It's \\\"grab em by the pussy\\\" and \\\"who has more money\\\". Its TV shows pitting people against each other and playing on people's vices and fears. The Dark Side\\, it seems is here. These are the messages going out to the kids these days\\, folks\\, and it's pretty scary. The innocence of A New Hope may seem quaint now\\, but it was awfully nice to have. And we could have had a little of it here - something positive. But Johnson decided it was time to \\\"kill the past\\\"\\, so he killed Luke\\, and created a whole bunch of other chaotic nonsense that pretty much rules out all the things that Obi Wan ever said\\, which to me is the ultimate crime. And no\\, one kid at the end with a little force power doesn't make up for all the rest of it. That's way too easy. That kid could've appeared anywhere in this movie with his broom and it would have had the same effect\\, probably cooler if it wasn't given such weight as the final scene. \\n\\nWhen you're seven and you meet Obi Wan\\, who is essentially an updated version of Gandalf\\, you have impressed on you that an elderly man ( or woman) can guide and give you good\\, rich advice and philosophy about how to live and how to be. And then he sacrifices himself for the cause. Of course\\, Luke does that at the end of Last Jedi - and that was an amazing idea and a killer ending to the movie - but we could have gotten there without all the other crap we didn't need. Johnson decided it was more important to \\\"kill the past\\\" than to honor it or update it cleverly. Showing some new young force kids - that's fine. But I'm pretty sure we all agree that in the Star Wars universe\\, the Force will be strong in some people. Clearly Rey has it in spades\\, and is just randomly connected to Luke for no reason\\, but isn't she then just a \\\"random force kid\\\"\\, basically\\, who ended up in the middle of the resistance efforts because BB8 stumbled her way? Or is she somehow more important? These guys need to make up their mind - is it a story\\, or is it just random stuff cobbled together ? Because the story isn't really making much sense at the moment and I don't see how it's going to. It's fun having Chewie back\\, but isn't even Chewie kinda over it all this point? \\n\\nGeorge Lucas didn't \\\"kill the past\\\" when he made a New Hope. He updated it. Takes a lot more brains and cleverness to do it that way. And \\\"killing the past\\\" just for the sake of killing the past\\, well\\, again- why?  It's frustrating\\, because \\, really that's the only thing Johnson set out to do. It's like he said  \\\"i'm gonna just cut up everything A New Hope stood for and make it MY way\\\". Ok - that's fine. But who is Rian Johnson and why is he in charge of it for this movie? Just a question. I feel like he didn't really take it too seriously\\, and while anybody reading this probably thinks i'm taking it way too seriously\\, i'm actually not. If this was a fan film\\, made by a fan who wants to do it his way\\, then it's totally fine. But if it's going to be part of the \\\"canon\\\" then I think it should stick with some of the basic tenets that made the first one so great- not just the ","true":true}
