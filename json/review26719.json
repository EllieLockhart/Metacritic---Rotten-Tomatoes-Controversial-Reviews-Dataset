Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, this film maybe didn't have as big a critical impact than the Force awakens\\, but it did deliver an emotional pummel to me. I personally could not see anything wrong with this film. I don't know why people are hating on it and saying Rian Johnson \\\"ruined\\\" Star Wars\\, I loved it and would gladly go see it again. Sure\\, there were some (SPOILERS) major character losses\\, but at the end\\, it just somehow seemed right. Rian Johnson may have ruined Star Wars\\, but he ruined it in the best fashion possible.","true":true}
