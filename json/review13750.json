Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I were to rank this on a list of Star Wars movies\\, I would rank it last\\, behind Star Wars the Clone Wars animated MOVIE (the show is great\\, just the movie). It doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. Disney needs to model Star Wars movies for the hardcore fans\\, not for general audiences. Marvel has proven that if you cater to the hardcore people the general audience will jump on the bandwagon.","true":true}
