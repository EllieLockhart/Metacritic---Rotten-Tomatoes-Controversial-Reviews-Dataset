Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever.  More plot Holes than LOST and more bad acting than Showgirls. The plot holes started from the beginning.  Rian Johnson forgot that there is no gravity in space. So dropping bombs on top of a moving spaceship would never work since they would just float away.  And why were the bombers so close together if they knew that if one bomber blew up it would wipe out the squadron.  As far as the bad acting\\, Laura Dern was so stiff\\, I thought she was a mannequin.  Will never watch this again..  Could not wait for it to end.","true":true}
