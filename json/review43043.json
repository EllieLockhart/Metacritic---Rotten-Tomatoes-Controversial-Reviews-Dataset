Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very exceptional me and my family very much enjoyed it had a few issues but that\u2019s just my opinion and urge everyone to go see this amazing addition to the series and hope everyone doesn\u2019t base there thoughts off of what others say and go off of what you really think of Star Wars the last Jedi ","true":true}
