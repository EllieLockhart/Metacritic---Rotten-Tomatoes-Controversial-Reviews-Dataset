Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

How much did you get paid? If you're around 5-15 years old\\, then you might enjoy this movie. If you're use to semi intelligent movies than you're going to be bored to death. Scenes and drama played out\\, every little thing is dramatic\\, the action is pretty low\\, the acting is forgettable. I had to check the reviews on this because all I wanted to know when is the movie going to end. Watch this movie only if you need some noise in the background while you do some other task like cook or surf the Internet.
