Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry but the newest Star Wars is an abomination. It's littered with plot holes. Most of the acting is laughably bad. The dialogue is wretched. It's tonally inconsistent throughout and all of the jokes fall flat. Plus\\, Kylo Ren has to be the least intimidating villain of any major film franchise and Luke Skywalker's storyline is given a botched job. I'm not even saying this as a fanboy. It's just an objectively bad film\\, if such a thing is even possible\\, and yet\\, according to Rotten Tomatoes\\, 91% of critics claim to have enjoyed this movie. In short\\, I now have zero faith in 91% of film critics so if there is one good thing that came out of this latest installment\\, it's that it has exposed an industry of charlatans. Thanks\\, Disney (the force is not strong with this one)","true":true}
