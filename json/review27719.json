Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People complained that Force awakens was too much of a copy of episode 4 A New Hope and now that we have a new episode which follows its own story people are complaining again. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you this movie isn\u2019t worth seeing\\, it\u2019s amazing. Is it my favorite Star Wars movie? No\\, but it\u2019s by no means a bad movie. The action is top notch and the characters are better than ever. Don\u2019t let haters ruin this for you","true":true}
