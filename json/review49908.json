Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You don\u2019t like TFA Bc it was too much like ANH. You don\u2019t like TLJ Bc it\u2019s too different... Guys it\u2019s a good movie. Better than the Prequels and TFA and Rogue One. ","true":true}
