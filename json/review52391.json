Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great film\\, and will require rewatching so I can determine how much I liked in comparison with others in the series.  My first guess would be that its on a par with ROTJ and ROTS\\, not quite empire\\, and nowhere near as bad as the Phantom Menace.  I do agree with many other reviewers when they say Kylo Ren is a poor mans Vader.  Hopefully is full turn to the dark side will be in Ep 9","true":true}
