Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a convoluted mess. There was so much going on\\, it felt like no character actually had any development.\\n\\nNo consistency with time and scale. It was hard to tell if events were happening at the same time or if they were weeks apart.\\n\\nWhile The Force Awakens was just a rehash of Episode 4\\, it was still a very fun and enjoyable movie. However\\, this latest installment was a train wreck from start to finish.","true":true}
