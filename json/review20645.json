Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it twice now and it might very well go down as my second favorite Star Wars film. I thought Episode VII was weak and was very happy that this threw away most of what I didn't like about it. Star Wars was all over this film and you could tell Rian was a fan. He did a great job bringing in the spirit of Star Wars while not making it a carbon copy like JJ did. People are going to whine because their fan theories weren't realized and because it dared to do something different. That's fine. I loved it and personally think it will go down as one of the best.","true":true}
