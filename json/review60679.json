No chance of it being due to the game having flaws in a lot of people's eyes\\, or what do we call it\\, their opinion? Both sides are being really pathetic over this\\, this game has drastic changes compared to the first one\\, they take away  the things people love from the series\\, people won't react nicely\\, but to blame it all on minor aspects of the game like a character being trans or the other being really muscular? If you really liked the game you would listen what others think about this game\\, be it good or bad and allowing discussion\\, but how people are acting is really infuriating\\,  i really liked a lot of parts of this game\\, mostly Abby parts\\, but how the game at it's core is all mixed up\\, i cant bring myself to give this game a rating higher than 5\\, and how people are acting like this is **** whilst ignoring the technical aspects\\, gameplay and all other things due to the critics reviews is unfair makes me not want to give this game a score under 5. And as counter measures people are counter review bombing this with 10's making the other side continue bombing this with 0's\\, the thing i recommend the most for you to do is\\, play the game\\, form your opinion\\, dont baseless say this game is a masterpiece because other people are saying its trash\\, dont say its trash since other people say its a unflawed. Form your opinion. And i hope people stop ignoring this game's flaws and this game's right doings.\rThis game's reviews  is a prime example why people shouldn't trust reviews and should trust their own gut. And if someone were to ask me: \\\"Should i buy this game?\\\" i'd tell them no\\, but there's always a chance you could like it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
