Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":".. the battles make no sense at all.  unlike ep 1 to 6 & rogue 1\\, there are escalating\\, almost credible stakes. there's a suspension of disbelief and they're fun.  ll the battles in this movie are simplistic and not even internally consistent.  there's just about no character development\\, for either the characters you've cared about for 40 years (e.g luke skywalker\\, princess leia\\, general ackbar\\, chewbacca\\, etc) nor any of the new characters (poe is truly awful\\, finn \/ rey are flat\\, kylo ren has virtually no dimensions at all\\, etc).  the timelines don't make any sense at all given what is physically proposed .. etc.\\n\\n.. its a week and a bit later\\, and my dissappointment has just grown.","true":true}
