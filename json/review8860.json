Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For some reason Leia can fly like superman\\, Luke gets beaten in a stick fight by Rey - he's so lame now...she doesn't even need to bother with a lightsabre. The Resistance demonstrate their courage by running away...and hiding behind a big door??!?!!!??  Nothing makes any sense and Jedi powers now seem to come as a drive-in side order...or as a way of getting to the next scene. It feels like my mum had a go at trying to write a star wars movie and wasn't sure which person needed stuff like those 'light sticks' and 'magic' powers. It's a mess...a good looking and incredibly shiny\\, polished looking turd.","true":true}
