{"101487":175322,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a visual masterpiece irrevocably harmed by a terribly written story.  Apart from the many plot holes and Mary Poppins Leia\\, the film suffers from 3 major issues.  1. The character of Luke Skywalker is not  Luke Skywalker.  We leave Luke in episode 6 as a character that has completed the hero's journey and has arrived as a paragon character.  A character whose defining character is his \\\"faith in his friends\\\" and his belief in the good.  So much so that he risks everything on the chance that he can save his father\\, the most evil man (after the emperor) in the galaxy.  In this film\\, he has suddenly transformed into a reclusive hermit that has abandoned his friends to face evil alone. He has become a broken man after facing failure... which he had previously faced in episode 5\\, but apparently that doesn't matter to the writer of episode 8.  In any case\\, Luke isn't Luke\\, the entire film gives the middle finger to his character and to the fans who followed his character arc through 3 films.  2nd problem\\, Rey is a nobody.  This confirms her as a Mary Sue.  She does anything and everything perfectly\\, there is nothing she can't do with ease\\, even though she has zero training\\, zero experience\\, and now no blood line to back up her skills.  In short\\, there's nothing to her character\\, she's entirely forgettable and it's easy to just throw her away.  Finally\\, Snoke.  Built up as a mysterious bad guy\\, he's killed off with ease.  I think this is done for shock value\\, but he's most definitely dead.  So all the building in episode 7 is thrown away in this film.  there are other issues\\, like the random SJW infused in various parts\\, plot holes from the opening (like how did the first order suddenly take control of the whole galaxy in 5 minutes? where is the Republic? etc).  Overall\\, this film is well shot. The acting is very good and some of the performances are excellent.  But the story and writing is just terrible.  If this were a stand alone space movie and not the 8th installment in a trilogy of trilogies\\, I'd give it 3.5 stars.  But it is the middle film of a trilogy of trilogies and has to meet certain expectations.  It fails entirely and dishonors the characters from the preceding trilogy.  Frankly\\, I don't know where they go from here and this film has made me lose all interest in seeing episode 9.","true":true}
