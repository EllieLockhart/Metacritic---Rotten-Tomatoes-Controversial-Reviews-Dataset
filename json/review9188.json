Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"FYI\\, I am hearing rumors that RT is throwing out votes that notate \\\"1\/2 star\\\" on their reviews as RT deems those votes too extreme for proper calculation of the audience score.  Thus\\, the 51% audience score figure is questionable.  If you look through the reviews for the past 10 days\\, the likability rating should actually be at around 25-27%\\, but since 1\/2 star ratings are not being tallied\\, the result is skewed.  \\n\\nP.S.  This movie was AWFUL!!!","true":true}
