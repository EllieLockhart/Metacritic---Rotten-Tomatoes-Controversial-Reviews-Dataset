Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the movie for the second time\\, I can say this movie is right up there along side Empire Strikes Back as the best in the Saga.  Wonderful acting\\, terrific special effects and an awesome story.  The birth of the new Rebellion and of course Rey\\, the Last Jedi\\, who was awakened in the first movie.  So cool to see Kylo Ren kill his one true enemy\\, like Vader should have done\\, to become the Supreme Leader of the First Order.  Well done\\, I really enjoyed it\\, along with Revenge of the Sith\\, Rogue One\\, A New Hope and the Empire Strikes Back\\, and including Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens\\, including The Last Jedi\\, we have some fantastic Star Wars movies to watch\\, and are truly lucky to be able to enjoy such awesome Science Fiction.","true":true}
