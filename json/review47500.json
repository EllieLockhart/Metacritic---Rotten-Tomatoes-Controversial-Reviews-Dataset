Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is this s**t?! Right now users gave The Last Jedi a 56%. Have they lost their minds?!?! The Last Jedi was The Empire Strikes Back of the new trilogy! It was so good. The plot was great\\, loved the characters\\, John Williams score was much better\\, and the CGI was fantastic. I can\u2019t believe people would hate this. My only issues with the movie was the plot with Finn and Rose. It felt a little choppy and took away from the film. And Laura Dern\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t that good. Her character had no purpose\\, except for one part. Other than that I loved this movie. I had the most fun (not saying it\u2019s the best movie) in the theater watching it. I saw it twice already and it was better the first time. I hope you go out and see this marvelous film. My Grade: A-","true":true}
