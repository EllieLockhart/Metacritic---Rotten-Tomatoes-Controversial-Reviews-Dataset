Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An abomination\\, an affront to the sense of decency\\, disrespectful to the Star Wars legacy. Intellectually incoherent\\, gaping with massive plot holes and fruitless sub - plots. An insulting effort to genuine Star Wars fans but perhaps a suitable entry in the catalogue of Soviet Propaganda films. The folks at Disney doused my childhood memories in gasoline\\, put a match to all that nostalgia\\, and tried to put out the ensuing bonfire by spewing green milk spouting from a space manatee all over it. A colossal failure. \\n\\nEnd of the line for me and Star Wars.","true":true}
