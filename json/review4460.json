Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Change for the worse. Completely destroys what episode VII set up. Dumbed-down and amateurish. Tried way too hard to be clever with the twists--which gets annoying very quickly and feels like a joke. Where's the continuity?--it's the sequel to episode VII... in a trilogy.","true":true}
