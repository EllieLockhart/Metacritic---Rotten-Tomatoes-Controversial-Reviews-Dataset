Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"how in the world is this movie certified fresh!!! This wasn't the worst Star Wars move\\, but it wasnt the best either. the movie took to long to develop\\, the casino planet was a waste of time\\, it really didn't fit\\, neither did Benicio Del Torsos character... I hope the Han Solo move is better.","true":true}
