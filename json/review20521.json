Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been watching Starwars movies since I was little kid and there was no way in the world I was going to miss the next installment.  The Last Jedi it's a Breathtaking and beautiful movie that had me on the edge of the seat the whole time with excitement and plot twists that only gives me the desire to see the next movie. The movie was full of surprises that I didn't expect at all and\\, since a predictable movie its nothing but a boring flick\\, that's a good thing. Would I have done something different? Sure\\, but I'm in for the ride that Lucasfilm is taking me with this trilogy and that ride finishes when episode IX is done and the full vision its presented.","true":true}
