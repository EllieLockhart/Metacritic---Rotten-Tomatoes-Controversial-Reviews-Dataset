Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it Sunday\\, Hamil and Fisher steal the show. Everyone was great. Didn't know Del Toro was in it\\, was happy to see him. I thought Rey should have been directed better\\, she doesn't change in any of the films; she's a strong confident character with no depth. I do hate to say that\\, because I don't feel its the actors fault\\, maybe bad directing or bad writing and\/or an unfortunate attempt to please the hyper sensitive. Obviously these are watered down internationally focused films being made in an era of\\, possibly\\, well meaning pc crazies\\, but I still support the film's overall tone of morality and love. An adult star wars franchise would be pretty rad. Not a bot. Made this account to counter the trolls and defend a great film with a great cast. Thanks.","true":true}
