Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This one truly pushes and stretches the boundaries of what we've previously seen in Star Wars movies. You'll either love or hate that\\, so the mixed fan reaction doesn't surprise me. \\n\\nI\\, for one\\, loved it\\, even as someone who's old enough to have grown up with the original trilogy. Last Jedi paid its share of homage to those movies\\, but it also cut its own path in many ways as well with the new characters and storylines. As it should. \\n\\nThis is ultimately what the Star Wars movies should be about -- inventiveness. Fanboys quibbling over certain things not adhering to the letter of a Wookieepedia entry on this character or that are missing the point.","true":true}
