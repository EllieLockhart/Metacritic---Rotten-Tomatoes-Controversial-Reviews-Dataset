Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has been written and directed so bad that had betrayed the continuity of Star Wars legacy and destroyed the hope and faith of the Star Wars audiences to continue their imagination and connection to the legendary heroes. The only way to save the Star Wars saga is to change this movie name to \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi-Parallel Universe\\\" and announce by Disney that the episode 9 will be the true sequel of episode 7.","true":true}
