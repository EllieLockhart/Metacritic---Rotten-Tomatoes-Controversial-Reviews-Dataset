Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Terrible. A garbage fire. A betrayal. Ridiculous. MInd-blowingly dismal. An absolute and unmitigated failure. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy should never be allowed anywhere near the Star Wars universe ever again. This movie is a failure on every level. A disaster. An out of control\\, runaway trainwreck. Shockingly bad. A unique\\, once-in-a-lifetime disappointment. Traumatizingly unpleasant.  It strains the mind to imagine how they could've fumbled any worse.","true":true}
