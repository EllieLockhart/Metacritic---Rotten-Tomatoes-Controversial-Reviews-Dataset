Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only think enjoyable about this movie was the visual effects. It failed in every aspect of storytelling. There are a plethora of plot holes. The themes don't jive with the characters. Half the actions taken by characters don't make sense\\, or don't fit with the character. Luke's part in this movie was wasted. This movie actually ruined star wars for me. My expectations for Episode IX are 3\/10","true":true}
