Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautifully shot abomination to everything that has gone before. It is like they purposely have tried to anger the fans of original Star Wars. The new characters they introduce are awful and pointless\\, and they treat even The Force Awakens with disrespect. It seems as though Rian Johnson has tried to stamp on JJ Abrams vision by destroying everything he set up for this new trilogy. I was so disappointed that\\, for the first time in my life\\, I no longer am hyped for new Star Wars. They need a break and a serious re-think about what they are producing. Bring in some people to head Lucasfilm who are actual fans of the franchise.","true":true}
