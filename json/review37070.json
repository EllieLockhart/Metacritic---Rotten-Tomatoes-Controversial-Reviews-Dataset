Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new Social Justice Wars movie\\, and seemingly trilogy it looks like\\, is a collection of left leaning political cliches. \\n\\nI don't have a problem with that in and of itself\\, except in cases like this where they force it in at every opportunity possible while sacrificing quality and legacy.","true":true}
