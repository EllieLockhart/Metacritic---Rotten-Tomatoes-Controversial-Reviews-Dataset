Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrible! I have been a Star Wars fan since 1977. I\u2019ve owned every copy of the Star Wars movies from VHS to Blu-Ray and have seen them hundreds of times. I\u2019ve watched all of the movies with my children since they were born and when old enough we\u2019ve been to see them in the theaters. This movie is the only copy I do not own or even care to. This is the only Star Wars movie I have only seen once. Rian Johnson has no business directing any Star Wars movies period. I\u2019ve seen fan made films that were much better.","true":true}
