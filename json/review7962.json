Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. The film had very little plot\\, essentially it could have been summed up in an half hour film. The battles we're lackluster; that is\\, there was very little character development\\, and it felt\\, at times\\, a bit rushed.\\n\\nI hope they fire this entire writing and directing team. Otherwise\\, im not seeing the next films. Star-Wars is dead\\, and I'm going to pretend none of this is cannon","true":true}
