Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please\\, please\\, please don't make another Star Wars movie... PLEASE! This thing needs to end! An improbable demise for a major character\\, baby Vader is still dumb and unconvincing when he tries to be intimidating. The young actors are still one of the worse acting ensembles ever and the storyline a bore. All good things must come to an end... Bad things like this should end even sooner. ","true":true}
