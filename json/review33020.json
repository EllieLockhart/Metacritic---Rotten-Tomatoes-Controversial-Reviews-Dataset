Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Strange\\, I went to the theater to see Star Wars\\, but all I saw was Rian Johnson and kathleen kennedy farting in my face for two-and-a-half hours.","true":true}
