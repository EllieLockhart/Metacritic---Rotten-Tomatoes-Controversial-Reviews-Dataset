Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just ok\\, and disappointing for that reason. The potential can be seen\\, but far too much time is spent on mediocre and childlike story elements\\, and over all it has the feel of a Star Wars copy. Not bad\\, but doesn't live up to the originals.","true":true}
