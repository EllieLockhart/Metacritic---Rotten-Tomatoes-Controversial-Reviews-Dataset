Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Final Star Wars: The Last Jedi Review\\n\\n\\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\"\\n\\nWith plenty of unexpected twists and reveals\\, an expansive story\\, beautiful action sequences and lightsaber battles\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi forges its path and instills a new sense of hope for moviegoers. Though this isn't to say The last Jedi is without its issues\\, Rian Johnson takes Star Wars to bold new places with an ambitious story. Sometimes that ambition doesn't quite land\\, and the film is too long for its good\\, but Johnson balances the old and the new with such care that when The Last Jedi hits\\, it hits big. In terms of performances\\, Mark Hamil\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver all give standout performances as well as Oscar Isaac. Without giving too much away\\, my favorite aspect of the Last Jedi was Lukes story arc. It was emotionally resonant\\, incredibly poignant\\, and to watch his character evolve throughout the film was outstanding. In all\\, they're a lot of things to love and hate about this movie\\, yes some sequences were drawn out and didn't need to be in the film\\, but for the most part\\, the good outways the bad. See this movie\\, it's a beautifully shot\\, well-made\\, Star Wars film. \\n\\nStar Wars Skywalker Saga: Rankings (Best-Worst) \\n1. Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back\\n2. Star Wars: A New Hope\\n3.
