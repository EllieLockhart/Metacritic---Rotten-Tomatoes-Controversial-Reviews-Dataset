False advertising that you would be potentially travelling with Joel through most of the game just to be smacked down when he dies in the first 2 hours of the game with such disrespect. Then they have the audacity to make an attempt to make you feel sympathetic to his killer while forcing you to play as them.\r\rThe story was so crap and they had 7 years to think of something great\\, but all they did was focus on political agendas and listen to the wrong people who do not even respect the gaming industry or video games in general. If you play this game and finish it\\, you will not feel satisfied whatsoever\\, because you do not even serve justice to the person who killed Joel\\, despite the fact you go across the country and kill hundreds of people just to get to them then change your mind right when you are about to pull the trigger on killing them.\r\rNaughty Dog has abandoned the fanbase's trust and should be bankrupted from boycotts on their games. They went full woke\\, so now they should go broke.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
