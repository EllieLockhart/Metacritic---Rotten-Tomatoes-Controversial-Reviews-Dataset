Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The development for Luke Skywalker's new character was lacking--they attempted to show that he was transformed after he contemplated slaughtering his nephew--but that is not enough because the image of Luke as an optimist is still entrenched in the minds of fans and viewers. Why didn't Admiral Holdo just tell the rest of the Resistance of her evacuation plan instead of leading them to believe that there was no plan and that she was just going to sit on her hands and let them all die?","true":true}
