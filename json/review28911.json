Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed\\, every plot point seems to be written on the basis that the audience will never see it coming\\, twists are nice but not everything has to be unexpected. Most of the characters don't actually achieve anything\\, it does not have the hallmarks of a well planned trilogy.","true":true}
