Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much PC.\\nToo many characters we don't care about\\, and too many subplots.\\nToo little information to fill in the gaps (Snoke? Who is he?)\\nToo long. What is editing\\, any way?\\nSpace flying Leah? Huh?\\nDisappointing overall. Entertaining parts\\, but what a waste.","true":true}
