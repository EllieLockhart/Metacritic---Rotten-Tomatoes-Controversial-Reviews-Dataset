Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched this movie with high hopes as The Force Awakens was pretty good and was leaving quite a few cliff hangers for this movie to expand on. \\nThis movie disappointed on all aspects. The character building was terrible. The cliff hangers were just cut off without much explanation. \\nThere is so much wrong with the writing. The introduction of fuel issues... the ex machina tracking... the BS humor... \\nNo reason to watch this. Ever.\\nHopefully Ep 9 will bring the entire series back on track.","true":true}
