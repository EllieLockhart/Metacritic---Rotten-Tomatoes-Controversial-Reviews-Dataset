Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disjointed from TFA. The plot contained many pointless subterfuges. It's almost as if Disney decided which action scenes\\, cast and shooting locations they wanted and *then* wrote the plot to string it all together. I very much prefer TFA to this one. Humor was ok\\, but it removed from the insidious (see what I did there) feel of the bad guys. Why bother hyping up the good guys if the bad guys suck?","true":true}
