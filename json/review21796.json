Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just came home from my second viewing. It is AMAZING and I can safely say it is now my favourite Star Wars film. Can't wait to see the next episode now!!","true":true}
