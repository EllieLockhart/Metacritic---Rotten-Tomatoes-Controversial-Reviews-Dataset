Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was good. Sure there were a few plot holes but it didn't affect the plot a whole lot. the main reason why people don't like this movie is because it didn't do things they wanted. it went in opposite direction that everyone was expecting. This didn't bother me that much. Overall I really like the character arc with Luke\\, the struggle within Kylo Ren\\, and the feeling of being lost with Rey. I understand why people don't like this movie and I respect that\\, but I personally love a lot about this movie.","true":true}
