Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a hot garbage fire with no consistent tone. Half the time it comes off like watching an animated cartoon for kid with Finn and new character Rose' s subplot seeming like a moral lesson for 7 year olds. Other times it wants to be a serious and violent drama but none of the new characters are established enough to make you care. Kylo is still evil just cause\\, Rey is still good just because. Add in forced humor that actually seems to pause for a laugh like it's a sitcom and\\, I don't know at this point I'm poised to say the prequels are on track to be a better series of movies.","true":true}
