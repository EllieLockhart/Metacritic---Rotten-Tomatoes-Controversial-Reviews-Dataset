Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it 3 days after opening.\\nDisney and Rian Johnson literally took a crap on my favorite franchise.\\nThe FA wasnt very gokd and i wasnt expecting this to be very good\\, but they went far and beyond the call to do absolutely everything to make this a horrible movie. Star Wars aside\\, as a stand a lone movie this is horribly written.","true":true}
