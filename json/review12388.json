Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe I was watching a movie made by a \\\"we are all equal and fair people\\\" kind of guy. A lot of pointless liberal scenes in this movie. I can write a better story in 3 min. And I quote Finn\\,\\\"well I guess it was worth it\\\". Now that I made my point. Oh wait then rose\\\"no\\, now it's worth it\\\".","true":true}
