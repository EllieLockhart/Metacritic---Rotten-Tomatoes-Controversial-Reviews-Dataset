Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible plot development\\,  horrible acting\\,  horrible screenplay\\,  horribly and cheesy lines.  Luke skywalker character was completely wasted.  I judge movies on how much i care for the characters. I could care less for any of them. Force awakens setup this movie up with a lot  of potential to hit it out of the park. You can't even say it was bunted. Thought i was watching a transformers sequel.  Cheap.","true":true}
