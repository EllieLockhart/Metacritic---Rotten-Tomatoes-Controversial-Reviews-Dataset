Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"From playing games since 1989 to now\\, I am truly blown away in how far we have come in story telling and video games as a medium. The fact that so many negative reviews on this site were from players who didn't first play the game and then see how the story makes you feel - and were angry over a a certain character's demise - writing it off as 'bad writing' is a shame in itself that they may have completely missed the point in what makes a character good or bad and why you as a player sympathise with certain characters in the story. What if I told you that all the characters were baddies in this world? When I finished the game a few days ago\\, I have been thinking about everything that led up to that point for the past few days too and there is so much to ponder over especially as when you look back at all the characters and you see how divided the current world is\\, it is easy to see that if there was an outbreak of this magnitude (ahem)\\, everything would indeed fall to ruin and people would become blinded by their own intentions. I think anyone who's written a negative review here will look back at their review after they've actually completed the game and reflect on how wrong they were. I challenge anyone here who has written a negative review to play the game to the end\\, then see whether or not you think Joel and Ellie are good people or maybe they lived long enough to become the baddies.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
