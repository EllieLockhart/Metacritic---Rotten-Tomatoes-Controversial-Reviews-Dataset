Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is yet another one of those franchise movies where more casual fans will like the flashy action scenes and enjoy it for the ride\\, but more obsessive\/intense fans who grew attached to these characters and the story will despise this movie\\n\\nafter the amazing-ness of TFA this was a major disappointment. did Rian Johnson even watch TFA?","true":true}
