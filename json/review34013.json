Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Trashed established Star Wars canon. Flat characters stumbling about. One character's heroic moment stolen (people in the audience actually said wtf). Luke was complely ruined\\, it was unbelievable. It seemed to be made by someone that never saw or read anything about Star Wars. I have lost hope for the 3rd movie release\\, even though I have been to every Star Wars in theaters since 1977. Sad.","true":true}
