Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I enjoyed the movie. However\\, there were too many red herrings for my taste. Snoke's character is never fully developed and was killed off way too easily. This was a major shortcoming. But\\, most of all\\, Reys parentage reveal was just terrible.  And to add salt to the wound\\, the director is mocking hard core fans posting images that all your Snoke theories are wrong. They may be wrong Rian but they were far more interesting. You build up these mysteries for 2 years and then this. Give me a break. The worst reveal of all time on both characters.  Captain Phasma' s character was never developed either. Then\\, Leia's Mary Poppins sequence and force ghosts interacting with the environment and you have a series on the wrong track. The only way to salvage this now is for Kylo Ren and Rey to be Brother and Sister with them somehow separated at birth without anyone knowing or sensing it through the force. I just don't see the tension between Kylo and Rey being developed for the next movie without this. It would have been far better to keep Snoke alive into E9 and Rey and a redeemed Kylo\\, as brother and sister\\, to defeat him.","true":true}
