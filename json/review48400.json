Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a pathetic script that seems to have been put together in order to frustrate fan-guessing\\, Rian Johnson manages to not only butcher one of the most iconic characters of the story of the cinema but also creates a new concept: a middle movie that is so anticlimatic that basically makes you hope that there will be no more after this one.","true":true}
