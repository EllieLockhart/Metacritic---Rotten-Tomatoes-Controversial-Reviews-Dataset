Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Leia Mary Poppins scene was comical and very disappointing. I felt the humor was okay\\, but at times overused. The whole Snoke thing was a waste...he could've been a great character.  The ending was very anti-climatic...I got totally excited and than it flipped to complete disappointment. Such a waste of an amazing character. Will the real Luke please come back!  \\n\\nI was so excited for this movie\\, that excitement is definitely not there for episode 9.","true":true}
