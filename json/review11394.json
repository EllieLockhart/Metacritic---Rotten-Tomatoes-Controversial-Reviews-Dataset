Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible\\, horrible cash grab from Disney. Sub par remake of Empire Strikes Back\\, fails on almost any level. I don't know what strings Disney had pulled to buy almost universal journalistic praise but to anyone who has ever seen more than one SW movie (or any movie\\, for that matter) it is clear that this is an below average movie at best moments and tremendous disaster at worst.\\n1 star\\, because I can't give 0.\\nBoycott Disney's Star Wars!","true":true}
