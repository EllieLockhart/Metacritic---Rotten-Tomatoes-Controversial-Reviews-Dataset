Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens I was excited for this film!  But the lack of direction was obvious here.  Story lacked any sensible flow and seemed like a combination of random thoughts and events.  They tried to do too much.  Fun battle scenes\\, but that's about it.  Critic scores seem fishy to say the least..","true":true}
