Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many fan boys\/girls on here that don't realize Star Wars is a fairy tale set in space. \\\"Once upon a time in a faraway land\\\"...oh I mean \\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away\\\".  Anyway\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver absolutely stole the show and possibly the whole SW franchise.  They were incredible and shared in my opinion the coolest scene in a Star Wars movie ever. I personally loved Luke Skywalker's arc if not because it's so similar to Obi-Won's and I'm an Obi-Won fan. Don't listen to the haters. According to them\\, nothing should be funny in Star Wars if it's not said by Han Solo\\, there should never be an equal amount of women and men in the rebel population\\, all original trilogy characters should be immortal and unchanging and always\\, always the main hero\/heroine should be related.  Bravo for Johnson for NOT doing that.  Move on people...and you know you'll watch Episode IX.","true":true}
