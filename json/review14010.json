Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(If you know bible verses really well this review may contain spoilers)\\n\\nI am happy to say the movie is thrilling\\, unique\\, well-acted and\\, dare I say it\\, spiritually profound. There is a series of scenes\\, (if you have seen it you will know which one[s]) that really evokes Matt 24:10-13.
