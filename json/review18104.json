Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it might be good\\, but I never would have guessed that it would be better than Rogue One\\, and almost better than Empire Strikes Back! For me\\, most Star Wars films are 1-3 stars with Empire being the exception (5 star).","true":true}
