Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Their was a reason why Disney made all the novelizations of Star Wars not Canon no more. They ruined George Lucas Star Wars. The Skywalker story is George Lucas vision. I don't care Luke is a force ghost. I think the ending felt rushed. I wanted George Lucas 7-9 vision not Disney\\, Disney fucked up Star Wars. \\n Is this move dark? Funny? What were they trying to after. I can't get the image of Luke jerking off am animal to get blue cum? Snook what the hell? The ending felt rushed .","true":true}
