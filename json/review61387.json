Without spoiler I'll list a few problems I found with the plot: 1. Characters don't behave consistently 2. Unlike it's predecessor\\, theme of this game feels somewhat distant for me. I found it hard to sympathize with the choices made by main characters. 3. I'm not happy with how some returning characters were portrayed. I have a lot of love for them\\, they deserve better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
