Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been there done that!  Ok\\, come on Disney get it together.  I forgave you for borrowing from The New Hope in the first one but really.  Replaying the same old storyline in this one.  I had high hopes for this movie and I left the theatre unsatisfied and frankly disappointed.","true":true}
