Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think a lot of people have missed the point! \\n\\nThis film is great. It addresses the issues of the Jedi\\, and the Sith. Good\\, and bad. The point being that it isn't all black and white. There are no absolutes. \\n\\nAlso\\, the people trying to address the \\\"science\\\" of star wars. It's fantasy! Space wizards\\, and giant laser moons. \\n\\nI'm not going to claim this is better than any other star wars film. The last Jedi is it's own thing. \\n\\nLoads of people complaining that the force awakens didn't take enough risks\\, and now loads of people complaining that the last Jedi took too many risks!\\n\\nRemember. Space wizards\\, silly round ball droids\\, funny aliens\\, and \\\"the force\\\"","true":true}
