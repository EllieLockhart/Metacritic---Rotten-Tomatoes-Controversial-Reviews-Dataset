Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS: The Last Jedi didn't give me any surprises\\, and met most of what I expected of the franchise. There will be purists who find fault\\, but I can say that I enjoyed it for what it is.","true":true}
