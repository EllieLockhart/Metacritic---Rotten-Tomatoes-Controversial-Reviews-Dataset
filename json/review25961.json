Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing short of spectacular--took me everywhere I wanted to go as a fan and to some places I didn't expect.  Many a touching homage to Carrie Fisher\\, which I deeply appreciated and brought a few tears to my eyes.  Anyone should go and see this film\\, and when you do\\, if you are a fan--clear your mind\\, focus.  Don't try to make this be the Star Wars story you think should be next.  Relax and listen to the story they are telling you.  If this is setting the table for Episode 9\\, I can't wait to see what story they want to tell me next!","true":true}
