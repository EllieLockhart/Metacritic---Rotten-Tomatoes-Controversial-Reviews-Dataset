The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Even after a couple of weeks of going over this in my head it\u2019s still hard to know where to start.\r\rThe biggest issue here is that this game is the much anticipated sequel to The Last of Us\\, which was a great game with an engrossing story. The major talking point here\\, and why this game is so polarizing\\, is the story itself.\r\rFrankly\\, the story is a mess and my biggest problem is the continuity of it. The games story suffers greatly from a case of too many ideas\\, all trying to be be crammed in to to one encompassing volume. We expect some level of flashbacks in the story as per in the first game\\, but the constant switching and changing up of viewpoints is downright Tarantinoesque.\r\rI don\u2019t expect this could have been fixed simply by making the whole sequence linear\\, that's too simplistic\\, and there are points to be made of events happening in parallel that makes the storytelling difficult from a single perspective\\, if not impossible.\r\rHowever\\, this greatly detracts from the continuity\\, and I never got the sense of engrossing story I did from the first game\\, the disjointed nature of the storytelling made it a chore to follow events to a conclusion. And when we get to the conclusion its such a jumbled mess it makes you wonder if the 30+ hours you\u2019ve put in were worth it.\r\rIt seems that Neil Druckmann had the concept of where the story wanted to go\\, as a parable of vengeance\\, but made it so contrived that the execution of seems to have been extremely poorly managed. Whether it was the high expectations set by the first game\\, or he simply wilted under the pressure to resolve character arcs that were always going to difficult to manage. (You wonder how the death of a key character such as Joel could have been handled so clumsily.)\r\rThere have been some controversy about the characters\\, but personally\\, I could not care less about the sexuality\\, gender or musculature of the main characters. Just make them engrossing and fit in to the story without awkwardly and randomly lurching from one event to the next\\, breaking any sense of immersion.\r\rThere are other negatives\\, such as some of the combat sequences\\, when the controls and jagged camera angles can make for some frustrating gameplay\\, which can also get repetitive. But these are minor compared to the storytelling debacle.\r\rAs for the positives\\, the level design and environment are great and visually stunning. You can tell a lot of effort has been put in to this and the small details\\, for example the way water runs off objects and pools\\, are incredible. As a stand alone game it may have been enough to make it good\\, even great.\r\rSo in conclusion\\, the damage has been done\\, it\u2019s out there now. Maybe they can salvage something from it\\, but it will stay with me for a while as a major disappointment \u2013 for not being able to live up to the expectations as a worthy sequel to the much loved first game in the series.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
