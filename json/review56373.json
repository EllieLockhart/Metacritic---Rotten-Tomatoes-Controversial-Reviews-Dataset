Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible Star Wars movie that was all over the place. Ruined old characters\\, introduced terrible new ones\\, and had so many ridiculous sequences that make you forget you\u2019re watching a Star Wars movie. Don\u2019t boost it for hype or because it\u2019s Star Wars. I\u2019m a die hard fan and hated it. Saw it Thursday before opening day and was crushed. ","true":true}
