Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looking for a Star Wars story with diverse and compelling characters\\, a meaningful plot twist that's well-executed\\, and lore that places the story in a rich and detailed universe?  You're in luck: Knights of the Old Republic is on sale for less than $5 on Steam.\\n\\n\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" offered none of the above.  Perhaps the new trilogy could stand on its own\\, but the failure of these new stories to appropriately fit with the detailed history already provided by the past films really makes them hard to like for me.\\n\\nI'd like to add\\, now that people are trying to spin the negative reviews as fake\\, that yes I made this account specifically to review \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" because I found it so disappointing.","true":true}
