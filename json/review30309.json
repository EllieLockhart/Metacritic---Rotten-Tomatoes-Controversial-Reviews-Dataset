Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Script was poor\\, acting was mediocre\\, the comedy felt flat and forced down the throat at times. Which makes me wonder how Johnson managed to even become a \\\"director\\\"\\, this movie made the Kardashian sex tape look like a fucking cinematic masterpiece.","true":true}
