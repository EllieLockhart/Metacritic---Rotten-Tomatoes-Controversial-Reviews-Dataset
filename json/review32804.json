Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS! What can I say? I loved it. Though it wasn't a perfect movie pacing wise\\, the good was so amazing as to make up for it. The fights were incredible. The characters were strong. I especially loved the Rey\/Kylo dynamic. And the Force has never been cooler. I saw it twice in 24 hours. I don't get why some people haven't liked it. Structurally the Force Awakens worked better\\, but this was new and took risks. For me\\, they definitely paid off.","true":true}
