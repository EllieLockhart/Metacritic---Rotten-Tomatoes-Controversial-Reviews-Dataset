Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They really disrespected the legendary franchise characters in this film. Its as if the old characters were forced into the story and they didnt know what to do with them. Instead of doing such a terrible job with the old lovable characters they should have left them out entirely. It might have improved the movie. And allowed people to watch it with a fresh state of mind. Not watching episode 9.","true":true}
