Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every other Star Wars movie (and show) has added lore and story line. Last Jedi failed at doing that. Instead Johnson sought to tear down what Star Wars has always been about and disregard lore and canon in many cases. And most importantly this film barely advanced the story of the sequel trilogy.","true":true}
