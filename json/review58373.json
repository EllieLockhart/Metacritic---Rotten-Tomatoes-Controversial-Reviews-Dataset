Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a second viewing\\, I can confirm I do enjoy this movie a lot. I can see why people don't like it. There are a lot of pacing problems\\, moments of cheesy and bad writing\\, and unnecessary subplots\\, but imo those don't overshadow the film's many great elements. I've seen a lot of people give this movie terrible reviews because of pathetic nitpicking as well as claiming that it murdered their childhood. It's fine to think that\\, but I just wish they would leave themselves out of it for a second and try to judge this movie as a movie\\, not by how much Rian Johnson strokes their egos by pandering to their ridiculous fan theories and preconceived notions about what the star wars movies should be. And I can say\\, as a movie\\, it definitely has it's flaws\\, but there are many moments of genuine greatness that overshadow the problems. It kept me guessing\\, and the payoffs weren't anything like what I was anticipating\\, but I found this to be a positive. Some will say this movie cucked them\\, but if you have an open mind and haven't obsessed over elaborate theories in your head\\, I think you will be entertained by this movie ","true":true}
