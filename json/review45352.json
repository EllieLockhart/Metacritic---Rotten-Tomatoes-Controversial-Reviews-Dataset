Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly shocked and stunned with the twists and turns of the plot...Director Rian Johnson went off in a completely different direction and never looked back...I have to see it at least 3 times more to make sense of it all...well done!!!
