Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than The Force Awakens for sure. It's got nods to the original trilogy\\, but stands on its own two legs. The settings are whimsical and felt so right\\, and I loved every single alien creature they introduced. The biggest flaw was that most of the plot could have been avoided if they just freaking COMMUNICATED with each other. But each character had clear motivations for everything they did. The Force was explored like never before - no midichlorians\\, but a deep delve into the light side\\, the dark side\\, the Jedi\\, the Sith\\, and the connection between the Force and everyone and everything in the galaxy. Now\\, if you have a problem with a lack of white guys in important roles\\, I have some bad news for you: this movie has a lot of women and people of colour in leadership and important roles. (To the rest of us\\, this is very good news indeed.) \\nIn short\\, very Star Wars. Would recommend.","true":true}
