Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please ignore the people who say ignore the haters.  This movie isn't just a bad Star  Wars movie\\, it's a bad movie.  Maybe 15 minutes of actual (bad) plot padded to over 2 hours by nonsensical pointless writing.  Disney is trying to slowly wipe out any previous Star Wars characters and replace them with their own shallow poorly written and conceived characters.  If they wanted to make their own sci-fi space epic\\, they should have just made their own sci-fi space epic.  Don't ruin a wonderful universe.\\n\\nI do not see how anyone could rate this movie highly that had any kind of intellect.  It's just a poorly written piece of drivel that tries to win over 8 year olds with fluffy looking puffin things and pokemon ice foxes.\\n\\nTFA had obvious problems\\, but it was at least fun.  This isn't fun\\, is a giant plot hole of wasted time\\, and may be the beginning of the end of Star Wars.\\n\\nWe know Disney can make a smart Star Wars film as Rogue One shows us.  Let's get back to substance and storytelling instead of Michael Bay style writing and directing.\\n\\nREALLY DISNEY\\, A YOUR MOM JOKE?!  Don't insult us!!!","true":true}
