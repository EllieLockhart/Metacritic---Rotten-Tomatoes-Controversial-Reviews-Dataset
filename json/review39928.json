Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is definently the best Star Wars yet. With incredible speacial effects\\, this recent instalment in the stra wars saga brings the movie up to its highest. There are some scenes that aren't neccissary for the movie to be a big hit\\, but the movie in general is worth the wait.","true":true}
