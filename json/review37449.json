Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are moments of greatness in an overwhelmingly poorly written farce of a Star Wars movie. \\n      The main problem\\, besides the sloppy writing\\, is the enormous leaps in logic the director expects the audience to make.  \\n    I'm not saying my expectations are dampening my experience\\, but when you hype all these plot points and characters up for 2 years and don't deliver people are going to be upset.","true":true}
