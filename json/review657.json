A mystery with multiple layers and unexpected twists makes this game all the more different and unexpectedly enjoyable\\, at least for me. On top of this\\, the game features eight young adults averaging around the age of 18 who are the perfect amount of stereotypical and are made all the more interesting with great actors to provide the voices. Stars Hayden Panitierre\\, Rami Malek and Brett Dalton play three major characters with a lot of dialogue. I was particularly impressed with these three performances\\, but also Jordan Fisher's portrayal of Matt and Meaghan Martin's portrayal of Jess. However\\, the entire cast gives an impressive performance and successfully brings the script to life. With an appropriate build-up and randomized pacing\\, this game gets bonus points for simply being the first game to give me this type of experience. I haven't done much research but I know the developers were not very well known before this project and had very little experience in game making. It seems like they gave it their all in the department of making this game unique. I only hope that the success of this game allows the development team to learn and improve upon the content of Until Dawn to create some type of sequel or follow up to the title.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
