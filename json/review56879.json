Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There\u2019s moving on with new stories and there\u2019s disrespecting the past in order to get there. This movie isn\u2019t bad; it\u2019s well made and has excellent performances by Hamill and Driver. It is\\, however\\, a film that can only succeed by deconstruction. It must I make the characters we came to know and love before to move on. Do we become excited for new characters by making the old heroes into bitter shadows of their former selves? Is a story really well written if it requires its actors to completely go against their character\u2019s motivations and morals to advance plot points? There is change and there is a blatant misunderstanding of what made the past so magical. This film quite literally thinks you must destroy the past to move on\\, and it left me caring less about the current characters and their motivations as a result. What\u2019s to stop another film from deconstructing Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rey? I don\u2019t care that this film wants to change and move on. That\u2019s commendable. I lament that it doesn\u2019t understand Star Wars\\, its characters\\, its universe\\, or its magic.","true":true}
