Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a great addition to the Star Wars universe. It really brought together the old and the new. Some reviews said they expected it to be better or were disappointed. Once again they see the movie from the view of a critic instead through the eyes of the kids we were when we first saw Star Wars. The movie had everything a Star Wars movie is suppose to have. Good Job....loved it!","true":true}
