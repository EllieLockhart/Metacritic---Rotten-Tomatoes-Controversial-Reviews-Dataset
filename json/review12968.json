Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not understand the love critics have for this movie. The acting was mediocre at times\\, there were at least two plotlines that served no function to the movie and were just filler that ultimately never paid off in any way. There were several cringe inducing moments (particularly involving Leia. I was waiting for her to cry out \\\"I'm Mary Poppins\\, ya'll!\\\")\\, and it felt like the writer\/director completely gave up any semblance of obeying the laws of physics as well as the basic rules and abilities of the mythological Force. The big bad set up in the last film was basically a Macguffin\\, and the plotholes are too many to list here.","true":true}
