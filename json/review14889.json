Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly thought this film is a masterpiece of a Star Wars movie\\, this film has a bit that everyone\\, Star Wars fan or not\\, can enjoy. It balances humour with intense situations very well which honestly is a strength as it is very hard to do. Overall I thought this film was amazing and heart felt. My favourite Star Wars yet\\, and this is coming from a proper film nerd!","true":true}
