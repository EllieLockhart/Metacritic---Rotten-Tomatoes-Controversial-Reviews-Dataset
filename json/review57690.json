Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two steps backwards towards the flashy\\, hollow disaster that was the prequels.  There are genuine moments of authentic storytelling and character development (mostly focused on Luke and Rey's interaction)\\, but they are drowned out by an overabundance of flashy CG locales\\, aliens\\, ships\\, and aggregiously contrived plot holes.  It's a stark reminder that the Star Wars franchise has long been a marketing device\\, and has abandoned its storytelling roots.","true":true}
