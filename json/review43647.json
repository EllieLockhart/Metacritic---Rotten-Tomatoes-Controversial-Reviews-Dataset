Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was painful to watch\\, a crass rehash of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi\\, plot holes the size of the Death Star\\, giving Princess Leia nothing to do but worry\\, with time wasted on routine fight scenes while moments of potential depth were glossed over. I spent almost the whole time rolling my eyes. Don't believe the Tomatometer on this one. Everyone I know who has seen it wishes that they had not.","true":true}
