Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I respect the film because it made a lot of bold decisions\\, instead of reusing the same old formula. What I didn't like was the trade off. It made some of the big players feel less epic\\, and somewhat insignificant to overall story. I really hope IX pulls back the veil and reveals there's much more to what what we saw in VIII. \\n\\nWith that said\\, I would give it an 8\/10\\, and place it as my 5th favorite (TFA being #4). The movie was fun and beautifully shot. Other than some of the character decisions made in this film\\, I would have to say the whole Canto Bight mission was the film's weak link. It just felt boring and out of place. It's very unfortunate because Finn was my favorite character in TFA\\, and he didn't really get to shine in this one.","true":true}
