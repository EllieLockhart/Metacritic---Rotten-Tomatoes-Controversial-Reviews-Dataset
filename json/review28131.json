Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Political correctness gets in the way of good story telling. casino side quest pointless\\, luke's death is lame and the character just seem weak\\, mutiny could have been avoided with basic communication from leadership\\, battles were as silly as the bad guys. throne room light sabre fight ok but overshadowed by weird scenes like mary poppins leia and alien milk luke with nurse maids. what are you doing to the franchise disney?","true":true}
