Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, instead of spending half the movie tryin to wipe my childhood out and the other half convincing me general purple hair wasn\u2019t an idiot\\, which she was\\, he should of just built upon what JJ Abrams had built. JJ Abrams introduced new characters and made you care about them\\, Rian did a great job wiping that out also.","true":true}
