Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but a knife to the heart to those of us who grew up with knowing and loving episodes IV-VI. How they treated Luke Skywalker's character spits in the face of everything we know and loved about him. If you know his character arc this film makes no sense. Maybe if you aren't very familiar with the original trilogy you can enjoy the film but it feels like a betrayal of the entire world episodes IV-IV so beautifully created.","true":true}
