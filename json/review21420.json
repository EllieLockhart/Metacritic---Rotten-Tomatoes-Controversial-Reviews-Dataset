Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish they wouldn't have included the original characters in these two  Disney films I feel it has done them a great deal injustice and portrayed them in an unattractive manner. The only likeable character to me was Finn . And they didn't portray him well in TLJ. The story is not relatable CGI is great .","true":true}
