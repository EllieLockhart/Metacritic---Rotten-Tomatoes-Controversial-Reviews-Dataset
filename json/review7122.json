Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable and fun\\, but Disney's fingerprints are visible all over this story.  As a movie it is enjoyable\\, but as a Star Wars movie it left me with no desire to see what happens next.  I don't plan on seeing Episode 9 in theaters.  I did enjoy myself as I watched it\\, I loved the Military Industrial Complex commentary and a lot of things were done very well\\, its just not a very good Star Wars movie.  I think the critic score vs the audience score is very telling.","true":true}
