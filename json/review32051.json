Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS* \\nI don't even know where to start here to be honest... I feel like a child at Christmas who has had his presents stolen while I was having turkey. It's dreadful. Feels like a transformers film someone has crossed with iron Man. With Pie now being the galaxies Tony Stark.  Massive plot holes and holes in story. Who was Snoke?! No back story! And now he's dead! Proper cringy dialogue\\, the opening 5 minutes sets the tone with Marvel style yankee \\\"humour\\\". I don't even know if there is enough space here to write all this... I'm stunned. Shocked. Saddened... RIP Star Wars","true":true}
