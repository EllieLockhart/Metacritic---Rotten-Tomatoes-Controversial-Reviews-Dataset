Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took Star Wars in a fresh\\, new direction while still maintaining the feeling that a Star Wars movie expresses. It has some problems\\, but I found many of them to be even less troubling with a second viewing. It's certainly with flaws\\, but what were you expecting\\, the perfect Star Wars movie? It doesn't exist.","true":true}
