Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie can best be summed up as... disappointing. The humor in this movie did not work whatsoever and Rian Johnston managed to waste a series of characters who going into this movie I held such high expectations for. Also\\, Rose was an awful addition to this universe with her character motivation and any storyline involving her be being pure filler","true":true}
