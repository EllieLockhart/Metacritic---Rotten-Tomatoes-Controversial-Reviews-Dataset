Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what fans saw\\, but I am agreeing with the critics on this one.\\nThere are some premise issues and plot holes but otherwise loved the ride and saw some beauty in what was being set up.\\nI also enjoyed the twists - \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think\\\" is a mantra that kept popping into my head with each surprise.","true":true}
