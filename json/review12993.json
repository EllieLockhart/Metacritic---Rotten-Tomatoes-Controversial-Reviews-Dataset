Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't consider myself to be a massive Star Wars fan but I do enjoy the franchise. The Force Awakens was so much fun and I couldn't wait to see this.\\n\\nOverall\\, I'm disappointed. My biggest gripe is that not only were no answers given\\, this movie made it seem like the questions were irrelevant. Why bring up Rey's parents in the first one if they they aren't important? Why introduce a character like Snoke and then kill him off before we know a single thing about him? Why setup TFA in such a way that it seemed like Luke wanted to be found when in fact he really didn't? There are loads of things in this movie that make a mockery of what TFA set up.\\n\\nThe film was at least 30 mins too long. The scenes with Finn and Rose were utterly pointless by the end of the film. It seems to me like they introduced a decent character in Finn and then had no idea what to do with him in the this one. Seriously\\, he could have been cut from this film and it wouldn't have made a jot of difference to the plot. \\n\\nThe real shame here is that they have killed any hype I had for Epidose 9. The only speculation I have now surrounds how they are going to write Leia out of the universe. There just isn't anything intriguing or mysterious left.","true":true}
