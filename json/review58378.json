Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After I have sat on this for a day\\, I like it even less. They basically took the Force Awakens and made it worthless. In the overall plot\\, only one significant thing happened in 150 minutes. Bad guys built up in Force Awakens with mystery are easily killed off with relative ease. Luke\u2019s performance was pointless\\, Leia suddenly uses the force to keep from dying...a dark power\\, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Comedy is good but seriously the opening sequence wasn\u2019t funny. Degrading Hux does not add to his character it destroys it. Poe was a jerk and Finn\u2019s plot line was pointless. Maybe IX adds to the plot significance but as it stands today\\, I\u2019d rather watch the Phantom Menace than this hot mess.","true":true}
