Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing.  Some minor spoilers follow.  The film feels like it was cut like an Avenger's movie.  Trying to do to much.  It never takes the time to develop character's properly.  Everything happens to fast with quick cuts and the \\\"genuine\\\" moments and moments of character development feel forced.  I remember the moments that took their time in The Empire Strikes Back\\, like Luke's training\\, or the romance developing between Han and Leia are not present ANYWHERE in the movie.  Also\\, a lot of the movie feels like wasted time.  Luke on the island grumbling about how he can't leave\\, Rey should leave.  The ship with the other cast members just stalling til the story catches up to them.   There are some surprising moments and fun to watch moments\\, but they seem separate from the story as a whole.","true":true}
