Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can you say that's not already been said? It's an awful film. Adds nothing to the Star Wars saga but somehow takes almost everything away. It laughs at us for being Star Wars fans and kills off all theories without offering a better explanation. Thank God JJ is taking over 9. He's going to have to save the franchise all over again. Hope he gets back to his original ideas.","true":true}
