Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning: To all the people rating this movie half a star. RT is not counting your rating. That is why it keeps showing at 49%. I changed my rate to 1 star. \\n\\nNow\\, here is the review. \\n\\nWhile I was watching this movie I was constantly shaking my head in disbelieve about how bad this movie was. How the whole story is completely pointless and in the end goes nowhere. It felt like one of these stand alone superheroes movies living in an extended universe where things never change and characters have no arcs and remain the same so there could be countless sequels and spin offs. I don't think I will be returning to the movie theater for episode 9. I am done with Star Wars. Maybe one day I will watch episode 9 on Netflix.","true":true}
