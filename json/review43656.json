Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was quite frankly the most disappointing movie I've seen in a very long time. \\n\\nThe inept way the characters were written and the lazy manner in which this picture was edited was incredibly disheartening.\\n\\nI went into the theater with such high expectations to see Luke Skywalker again after all these years only to have the iconic character cut off at the knees with such carelessness was painful to watch.\\n\\nHumour was off and misplaced (to say the least) and the antagonist(s) laughably castrated to the point where we lose track of the stakes presumably at hand.\\n\\nSo bad.. So very bad... I easily position this movie at the he bottom of the heap... Even below \\\"Attack of the Clones\\\").\\n\\nStay clear folks. Bad movie.","true":true}
