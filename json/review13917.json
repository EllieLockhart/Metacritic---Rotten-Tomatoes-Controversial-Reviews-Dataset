Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you are just seeing this for the first time without know or looking at anything star wars you will find it very entertaining. If your a die hard fan of star wars lore your going to be in conflict. Disney Is not going to buy any of the books but will create their own lore even if it makes no logical sense. After watching this movie one can see elements of all three books in it: star wars\\, empire strikes back and return of the jedi.  They played it safe and mixed the content.","true":true}
