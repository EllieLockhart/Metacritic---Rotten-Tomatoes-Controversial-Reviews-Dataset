Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely disappointed that this seems to have been a missed chance. TFA created so many great characters to be further developed and questions that were yelling to be answered and it is as if TLJ film creators looked at all the great fan theories and said wouldn't it be funny if we just said none of it really mattered! With gender\\, race\\, equality and corporation issues shown to us on a daily basis\\, it didn't need to be so overly brought over and emphasized in a galaxy far far away. The creators seem to have brought modern prominently young sociaties issues and layered them throughout this film that in the end it looks like Star Wars but no longer feels like the Star Wars. Kylo Ren says 'let the past die\\, kill it if you have too' which should have been the films tagline as well as a warning to all long-standing Star Wars fans to let go of all your nostalgia for the previous films or this movie will kill it for you.","true":true}
