Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's almost as if Rian Johnson has never seen a Star Wars movie\\, let alone a Star Wars film featuring Luke before. The primary characteristics of Luke Skywalker are optimism\\, pacifism\\, a deep need to help others\\, and an incredible belief in redemption. Luke Skywalker in this film was none of these things. Personality-wise\\, Luke Skywalker in this film had as much in common with Luke in the original trilogy as he has in common with the Emperor\\, or a plank of wood. Even Mark Hamill's incredible acting talents cannot save this complete and utter departure from the original character and the total lack of anyone giving a moment's thought to character continuity. \\n\\nAnd the rest of the film besides Luke? Boring\\, circuitous\\, disrespectful to anything set up by The Force Awakens\\, and a less enjoyable watch than Attack of the Clones\\, which\\, let me remind everyone\\, has a pear floating scene. At least Attack of the Clones I can enjoy for being unintentionally funny and for the utter charm of Obi Wan. The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars film I regret seeing. As one wise soul on the ether of the internet said \\\"I'd rather see a Jar Jar origin film.\\\"","true":true}
