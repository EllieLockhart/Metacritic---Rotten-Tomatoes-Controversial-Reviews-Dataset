Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absolutely atrocious film.\\n\\nPluses - some good battle scenes\\n\\nNegatives - \\nLazy storytelling. Disjointed.\\nAbsolutely crucifies the established star wars 'rules' \\nInsanely unbelievable antics even by the standards of these kinds of films. \\nEven important characters seem to be merely bit-part\\, made of glass\\, a bit like the super weapons the First Order like to create\\n\\nall of that combines resulting in a film that lacks gravity (laser cannons in SPACE aside\\, jesus christ) - characters\\, events and items have no impact beyond pathetically thin plot devices. \\n\\nThe film drags and is average by sci-fi standards. As a Star Wars film it has perhaps done more to destroy the franchise for those that know it more than any other film yet to be released. It will destroy any Star Wars fan faster than a couple of fighters kill Planet-sized death stars in this universe.","true":true}
