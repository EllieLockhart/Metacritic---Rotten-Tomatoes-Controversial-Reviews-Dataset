Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not feel like a Star Wars movie at all ????\\nChoppy pacing and too many stories to jump between.\\nWorst part was my child hood princess turns into Superman in outer space. Second would be Rey escaping in a pod to be intercepted by the falcon which was never equipped to receive such things. Spoiler: All the heroes of your childhood are dead beats and are all dead now but the one who's actually dead in real life lol movie definitely isn't fresh lol is Disney got the review sites in their pockets too?","true":true}
