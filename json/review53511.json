Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst star wars movie ever. The writing was atrocious and reeked of disney. The originals and even the prequels gave thought to chracter develoment and the creation of an enticing story arc. Rian butchered what should have been a classic. No\\, it was not because our expectations were too high or the movie too hyped. I hate to buy into the idea that money is the singular driving force in our world\\, but judging from the overwhelmingly positive  critic response they either should not be in this line of work or disney and its deep pockets have destroyed their integrity. I truly hope this is salvageble but I deeply doubt it.","true":true}
