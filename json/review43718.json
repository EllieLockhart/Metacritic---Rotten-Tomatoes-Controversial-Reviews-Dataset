Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the first Star Wars film I had checked out in the cinema - and I have to be honest\\, I've actually enjoyed it\\, despite it being very very long.\\nBut now that I have it on DVD\\, I enjoy it more than I have at the cinema and consider it an all-time masterpiece.\\nSo please stop with the ridiculous hate speeches\\, for crying out loud! If you haven't paid more attention to The Last Jedi\\, you haven't been understanding The Last Jedi at all!\\nBesides\\, I don't mind if Luke feels grumpy\\, because he has his reasons.\\nSo if you're looking for an action entertainment masterpiece\\, turn away from Justice League (which is so not a masterpiece) and go for this film instead!","true":true}
