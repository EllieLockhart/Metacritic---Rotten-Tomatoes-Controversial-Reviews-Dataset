Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good action\\, but the story has too many characters and the villains are weak. Very disappointing. Destroys the Skywalker legacy and the Star Wars magic. This is just a marketing movie. The movie wasn\u2019t horrible or good. I have no idea what the critics are watching - maybe they were paid off by Disney. ","true":true}
