Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film all messed up.\\nNothing that was proposed in the previous film was respected. Clearly the Disney studios have repented of the course taken in episode VII.\\nThey have passed over all mythology. But what bothered me most was how they dismissed Supreme Leader Snoke. They did not explain anything about him and threw him out with a simplicity that did not fit into the story.\\nThey threw everything in the trash. Not even the mask of Kylo Ren survived the episode VIII.\\nThis movie is pure space junk.","true":true}
