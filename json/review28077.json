Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot misses the mark by a mile.  Rian Johnson totally ruined the movie\\, and possibly more.  Humor was misplaced.  Killing off Luke that way was disrespectful to fans.  Why kill off Snoke after building up a potentially awesome villain?  Where did Leia get her God-like powers to survive being blasted into space?  Stupid\\, stupid\\, stupid.  Ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
