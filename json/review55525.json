Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Negatives:\\n1. Superman Leia and overall bad use of CGI in the film\\, like when Rey's holding up the rocks.\\n2. Rose brought no skills to the team and could've been omitted from the film.\\n3. Finn and Poe should've had more time together on screen.\\n4. Rey convinces Luke to help them without much motivation\\, breaking his years of devotion of not wanting to use the force in a few days.\\n5. Unnecessary 'cute' humour during serious scenes. Kylo could you put a cloak on at least. Urgh.\\n6. Luke's 'fear' over Ben Solo's turn to the dark side. Fear leads to anger\\, anger leads to hate and ultimately leads to suffering. That id the path to the dark side.\\n7. Too many scenes where characters are saved at the nick of time. BB8 saving Finn and Rose\\, Guillermo del Toro saving Finn and Rose\\n8. Forced message about animal cruelty and the connection of wealth and war.\\n9. Snoke's death. But i think they'll bring him back because Kylo Ren as a villain is a joke. \\n10. Score was forgetful.\\n11. Cringy and prequely dialogue being spoused by Rey and other characters such as 'we need hope'\\, 'spark'\\, 'godspeed'\\, 'bastards' and 'cops'.\\n12. No tension in the finale to make me wanna watch Episode 9. Everything important gets wrapped up.","true":true}
