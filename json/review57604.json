Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To avoid being an \\\"echo chamber\\\"\\, I won't belabor and rehash the same points over and over again.   I realize that after 40 years\\, characters would evolve.  However\\, it's apparent that Rian Johnson completely misses that CORE VALUES actually define a character\\, and those don't change.   His treatment of Luke in this episode was horrible.   Beyond that\\, there were enough plot holes overall to fly a star destroyer through.   As a standalone film\\, this film had great shots and the humor was genuinely funny.   The problem of course\\, being this wasn't a standalone film.....this was the 8th episode of a continuous saga\\, and it felt even more disconnected than the last one did!!","true":true}
