Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was great! The plot line was pretty unpredictable with plenty of twists and turns. Sadly\\, it could have used more character development with some of the new characters coming into the story and characters that were killed off end up having more questions being asked about their past. It does borrow some elements from The Empire Strikes Back\\, but it doesn't follow the formula to the bone like The Force Awakens did with A New Hope.","true":true}
