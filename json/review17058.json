Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi as a movie in and of itself\\, but as part of the Star Wars arc it is quite problematic. I could say many things good and bad about the movie but they have all been said many times over. Instead\\, here is my idea for how Disney can rescue itself from the plot and character issues in The Last Jedi: At the beginning of Ep. 9\\, we will learn that for the entirety of the movie\\, Rey was in a Force trance controlled by Luke to test and strengthen her resilience and resistance to the Dark Side. Finn was dreaming during his healing coma\\, and Poe was in a VR leadership training module. Voila\\, they all return to reality and Ep. 9 can go on from there as if nothing happened\\, because it didn't!","true":true}
