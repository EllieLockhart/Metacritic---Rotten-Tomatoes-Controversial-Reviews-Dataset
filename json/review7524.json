Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone gives The Force Awakens such a hard time for being a riff of A New Hope\\, this is just alternate versions of scenes from Empire and Jedi. Its like the director had favorite scenes and thought hey wouldn't it be cool if they did it this way and then set out making that into a movie. \\n\\nThis movie made Awakens seem original and fresh. This was the first Star Wars movie that when I walked out of the theater I had no desire whatsoever to see the next one. \\n\\nAlso they did not show a preview for the Han Solo movie that is right around the corner\\, thats got to be a bad sign\\, and there are a couple of pretty good actors that look a lot like a young Harrison Ford but they went with a guy who looks nothing like him WTF!","true":true}
