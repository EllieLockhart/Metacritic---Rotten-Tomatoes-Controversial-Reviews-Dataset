Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is a great blockbuster film\\, but it is not a great Star Wars film. Action scenes are fantastic\\, but the plot and characters fail to develop in a way I had hoped. Some characters become utterly meaningless and others get way too much screen time. I enjoyed this movie as an action film\\, but it hurts as a Star Wars fan to see where the franchise has gone. Also\\, Luke Skywalker's legacy is tainted and it leaves a sour taste in fans mouths.","true":true}
