Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont care if its long\\, as long as it is good. Lord of the Rings is long\\, but fantastic\\, and want more of it. This movie was boring\\, politically correct nonsense. It could have been great\\, but failed.","true":true}
