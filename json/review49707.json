Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wowza\\, what a stinker!  \\n\\nDisney: I would like my 3 hours\\, $50+ for a crappy afternoon at the theater\\, my Luke and Leia Skywalker and my Star Wars back from ya greedy money grubbers.\\n\\nFor 40 years this saga gave us thrills\\, heroes\\, awesome battles and hope.  You gave us bad acting\\, corny dialogue\\, terrible new characters\\, cheesy CGI and no progression from the last episode.  \\n\\nI was disappointed\\, my spouse was angry and my kids were bored.  Way to take the first Star Wars movie featuring Luke Skywalker in decades and blow it as sky high as you did.  That takes real talent.  Way to go.","true":true}
