Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only word I could think about to sum up my experience with this movie is \\\"BORED\\\". I was looking at my watch more than I was looking at the screen and I don't even wear a watch.\\nThe only thing this movie did that had me even remotely interested is Kylo Ren\\, that's it I couldn't care less about anything ells at this point\\, Kylo is literary carrying this trilogy for me and I am dreading the next one\\, because I'm gonna have to watch an hour and thirty minute movie in order to get the thirty minutes of Kylo I'm actually there to see.","true":true}
