Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the movie I was looking for...\\n\\nAs a lifelong star wars fan and one who absolutley loved the Force Awakens I was really looking forward to this one. I had so many questions going in with huge anticipation. Who were Rays parents? Who is Snoke? How will they handle Leia now that Carrie Fisher is gone? Why does lukes lightsaber call to Rey? How did the First order become so powerful? Where are the knights of Ren?...And the most important one of all how will Luke affect the balance in the struggle against the first order?\\n\\nWell all I can say without spoiling it is that I felt like the movie gave me the finger on all of theese questions. There are so many WTF moments in this movie...and not the good kind. I left the theater with mixed feelings. But as it grew on me it left me with a reallyt bad feeling og where this franchise is going.\\n\\nThe movie is entertaining and the effects are spectacular\\, but as a die hard star wars fan it was the biggest letdown I have ever exprerienced as a star wars fan... (counting the phantom menace). And it brakes my heart to say so as I live for star wars...Can't say much more without spoiling it.\\n\\n\\nI got a bad feeling about this. I'm glad JJ is back for EP 9 and hopefully he can correct some of the mistakes made in this movie. You let me down Rian Johnson....and apperantly I'm not the only one who thinks so.","true":true}
