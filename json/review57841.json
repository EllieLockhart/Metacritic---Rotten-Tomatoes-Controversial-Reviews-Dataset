Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched this movie last Thursday night and I thoroughly enjoy it.  The Last Jedi gave us a different take on SW\\, that we are use to and I really enjoyed that unpredictability.  The space battles scenes were well shot and they really fleshed out the main characters in this film. My favorite story arcs\\, were Luke's and Kylo's.  They seemed more human in this film and it showed that they do have weakness inside of them\\, but that very same weakness can be used as a teaching tool.   I highly recommend this film for you to go out and watch at your local theater.   My only major complaint was one scene in particular\\, that I thought could've been trim down for time\\, because it kind of stalled the film and created a MacGuffin that seem to go nowhere.","true":true}
