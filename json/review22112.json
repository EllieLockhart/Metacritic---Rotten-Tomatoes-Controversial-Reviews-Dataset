Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"killed off every plotline left\\, and almost every scene was useless or left the watcher saying\\\"why? why did anyone approve this??\\\"\\nLuke's scenes were ok. Otherwise\\, skip or chug all the vokda in the house before watching.","true":true}
