Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand the hesitance and division that has been created by this film\\, even though I personally loved the movie from my first viewing. It takes everyone out of their comfort zones\\, it had a lot of scenes where you thought one thing was going to happen\\, and the opposite occurred\\, and it truly tests the limits of what hardcore Star Wars fans could ever expect. Much in the way that Empire Strikes Back tested the first fans of the franchise decades ago.\\n\\nWe must remember that in real life and in the film\\, ~34 years have passed since the events of Return of the Jedi (and it's been a full four decades since A New Hope). In the interceding decades\\, the fans have built up their own ideals about nearly everything within the SW universe\\, and everyone's interpretations are different - remember\\, Rian Johnson is just as big of a SW nerd as the rest of us are! And we are quite protective of the ideals we have built\\, which has lead to many an internet and coffee house argument over the years. Also\\, we've only been given a scant handful of events (particularly on screen) to give any understanding of what's happened in those three decades. We don't have the full picture to know what has caused all of the situations that have been playing out in the new trilogy - and they can only fit in so much information without driving each movie past a breaking point for time. And so they give us the most important\\, most relevant pieces to the overall story being told\\, the rest will become the new Expanded Universe of books\\, comics\\, and video games (some information is already in books and comics that were released in the lead up to this movie\\, and Star Wars Battlefront 2 has an entire DLC with info relating to the movie). We can't have everything we want all in one movie\\, or even all in a single trilogy\\, unfortunately.\\n\\nThere also comes a time where it is needed to break with traditions. The actors who play our favourite heroes are ageing\\, and they won't be around forever\\, as we so acutely have felt with the loss of our dear Princess. Rian embraces this with by using callbacks to the prior movies\\, while moving ahead with reintroduction of EU elements and new twists and tricks that haven't been used in the big screen setting before\\, creating new traditions for a new generation of Star Wars characters and fans.\\n\\nOne needs to go into this movie not expecting to be the one controlling the Force\\, but just surrender to the Force\\, and enjoy the experience.","true":true}
