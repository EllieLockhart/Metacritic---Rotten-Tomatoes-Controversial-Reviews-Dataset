The game focuses more on how to look good politically\\, with a disorganised story. I personally enjoyed the flashbacks with Joel\\, more than i did the rest of the game. The characters in game do not talk that much as theirs a clear lack of in game chemistry and character development. The Game doesn't feel like a part 2 of a legendary game. Im not even upset about Joels death\\, its the fact that it happened in the beginning of the game\\, and i dont mind the ending\\, its the constant drag of events and playing as a character(Abby) im told not too like in the beginning of the game. However\\, one thing i did like about Abby was her chemistry with Lev alot more than i did Dina and Ellie.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
