Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\n\\nI Know I know you already know all the star wars lore from Canon to legends. But you need to open your mind and try to go further. The directors vision it's difficult to grasp at first and it will displease many fans but this movie goes above and beyond what many expected. If you wanted Luke to train Rey and then Rey discover she was daughter to a master Jedi and that smoke was plagueis and that at the end luke destroyed everyone with his power you just want fan service and not a real story.","true":true}
