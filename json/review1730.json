Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone movie it contains enough action to keep you involved. As part of the over all Star Wars arc it left me feeling lost. The feeling of emptiness after leaving the movie is the first I've ever felt in any of the Star Wars movies. Two new characters who are successful actors were a complete waste of time in a long movie. Sigh I can't even take the time that the others have to express how bad this is for a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
