We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. From its brutal story to its very complex themes of hate\\, revenge and redemption. After ending my first playthrough at about 25 hours\\, I was emotionally tired this game knows how to play with your emotions better than most movies. Also the games representation of LGBT themes is very good to see!  It deals with them in emotional but thoughtful ways that adds a lot of depth to the characters! The game play itself has improved a great deal on the first game. Stealth is harder\\, upclose combat it way more complex. And this game looks stunning! I found myself taking ages walking through the ruins of seatle just to take in the view. For the people who are review bombing this game\\, its clear to me they have either not finished or even played the game or they simply do not understand the complex and deep nature of the plot! This game starts off as Ellie going on a helbent mission to avenge Joel's death and as a player you are behind her 100% but then at the halfway mark you find you self in Abbys shoes and it turns everything on its head. You see things from her perspective\\, her motives and the pain she has also been through. Thus casting the \\\"villan\\\" in a different light. So when you eventually come to the final confrontation  you are genuinely torn as to who you are backing. The main theme here is two wrongs don't make a right as you watch two characters helbent on revenge have every single ounce of their humanity tested\\, fighting for love. It is genuinely amazing to me that this game achives the amount of character development it does. Every character goes through so much in this game its painful to watch in some parts! So when you see the same story from two sides and are still not be able to make up your mind\\, who is right and who is wrong its tough! All the same bloody brilliant story telling! Naughty dog knocked it out of the park with this game. Its a roller coaster of emotions and a absolute thrilling ride! And as an avid gamer this is one of my favourite games of all time! So my advice don't listen to the bad reviews... go out there and play it for yourself! And make up your own mind!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
