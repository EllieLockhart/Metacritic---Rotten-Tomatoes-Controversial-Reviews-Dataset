Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars film I have seen. It was all about special effects and nothing about story. Very disappointed both the last two in this line of films have been hum drum.this one was s even worse then the first film. The only Disney Star Ware film that was good is Rouge One that film was amazing.","true":true}
