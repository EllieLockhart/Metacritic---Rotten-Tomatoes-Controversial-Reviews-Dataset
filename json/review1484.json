Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge fan\\, I had high expectations and they were more than delivered.  To say I loved it is an understatement.  This movie had me fully engaged from beginning to end.  One of the best movies I have seen...EVER!!!","true":true}
