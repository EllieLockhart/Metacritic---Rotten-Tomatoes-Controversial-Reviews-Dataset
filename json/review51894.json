Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film blantly disregards the previous film and everything set up. It feels as if Rian did his own thing without considering it is a saga and that his should lead on from the 7th film. \\n\\nLittle characterisation for characters other than rhey and Kyolo. Boring filler with Rose and Finn. Political agendas pushed for no reason. Timeline issues. The movie doesn't get anywhere. Disregard for lore. It was different because it wanted to be seen as being different\\, but different can be bad as with this case.","true":true}
