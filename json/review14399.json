Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had hope after Rogue One. But this film has a total disregard for any of the past characters and themes. The new characters have no proggression and are pretty much flat. Any interesting questions brought up in TFA dont get answered. And the blatant politicization in the last jedi makes it the worst star wars movie. The prequels are complex masterpieces in comparison","true":true}
