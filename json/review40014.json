Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my favorite Star Wars movie so far (something I never though I'd say). But plot and the characters were much more multi-faceted than most of the other movies\\, but I felt the creators were still completely true to the original trilogy. It's fantastic!","true":true}
