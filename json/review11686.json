Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How amazing can a movie get? It turns out that this movie is amazing\\, with great action sequences Star Wars The Last Jedi does have not so great pacing and you can feel a bit cheated by the end this movie great. A must see if you are a casual or a hardcore Star Wars fan.","true":true}
