Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It breaks my heart to say I wasn't blown away by The Last Jedi. There were many nods to the previous movies and it had great humor in it\\, but it didn't have any of the classic Star Wars charm. It was bloated\\, drawn out and completely unsatisfying. Honestly\\, a forgettable clumsy disappointment.","true":true}
