Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much fun.  Wonderful movie.  Flawed for sure...  hux shouldn't have been such an dunce\\, that casino thing had no center and should have bee A LOT shorter or cut altogether\\, Maz's cameo had no place in this move\\, and the Leah in space thing was tough to suspend disbelief for...  BUT\\, Luke...  amazing Luke+Rey...  amazing.  Rey+Kylo...  amazing.  Luke+kylo...  off the charts amazing.  Kylo's story arch is so\\, so\\, so good.  Finn is fun.  Chewy fun.  Po Fun.  Action great!  Theme of sacrifice for the team is great.  And all the Jedi order talk with Luke Rey and yoda was great.  The good definitely outweighs the bad with this one.","true":true}
