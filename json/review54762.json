Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I struggle to understand the Critics Consensus on this film. Let's pretend I am not invested in the 40 year arc of this story. There are three plot lines in this film. One of them goes nowhere at all but rather seems to serve as an excuse for product placement and fattens out an already long film. One of them is idiotic as the entire premise is a spaceship running out of fuel. And one of them is a relationship between a teacher and a student involving no teaching. Imagine if Mr Miyagi just refused to teach Daniel and you spent an hour watching Daniel hang around his house anyway. The jokes fall flat time and time again and twists seem included because they worked on Game of Thrones so they might work here. Now lets get to the really problematic issue - the treatment of a seminal character. Luke Skywalker is hardly the \\\"man with no name\\\" Eastwood-esque gunslinger some reviews would have you believe. He is frightened\\, spent\\, failure. He is a shadow of the hero of the original trilogy and never becomes more than a shadow. There is no heroic passing of the baton here as there was for Han Solo. One wonders if Director Rain Johnson is angry over some youthful slight whereby his friends always played the Luke role in childhood games while making him take on the role of Threepio! Such a disappointment!","true":true}
