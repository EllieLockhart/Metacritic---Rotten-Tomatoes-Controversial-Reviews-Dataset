Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing is atrocious\\, with huge plot holes looming everywhere you look. Character development is non-existent for all but Kylo Ren\\, which is the only character I left interested in at all. In nearly every scene there is a joke forcefully jammed in\\, whether it fits or not. The lack of experience shows through from the director\\, writer\\, and actors. I can confidently say I have no plans to view Epsiode IX after this debacle. Disney is putting on a clinic on how to ruin a massively valuable IP. An immensely disappointing experience for a lifelong Star Wars fan.","true":true}
