Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics are perhaps not bought off but the tomato-meter is definitely dishonest about the reviews.I read a lot of lukewarm\\, average and so-so reviews getting fresh tomatoes. I fail to see anyone mention the obvious Disney commercial at the end of the movie with the Rebellion decoder ring logo and wish upon a star ending. A few things make me suspicious about some of the critics as being inauthentic. No mention of light saber skills and extreme Force use is now just a birth right rather than taking years of training. There is no mention of overuse of CGI and the use of unfunny gags that were the source of criticism about the prequels. The stretching of multiple subplots and and thin character use which is heavily criticized in non-Disney films are almost non-existent in the reviews of this film on Tomatoes. I am skeptical that my review will even posted or my 1 star rating will be counted as well on this site.","true":true}
