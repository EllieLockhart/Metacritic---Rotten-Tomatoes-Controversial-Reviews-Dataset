Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I mean there is a lot of good scenes in this movie\\, but overall just a HUGE disappointment to any real Star Wars Fan. Unfulfilling and unsatisfied seems to be the word everyone felt walking out\\, and I agree 1000%","true":true}
