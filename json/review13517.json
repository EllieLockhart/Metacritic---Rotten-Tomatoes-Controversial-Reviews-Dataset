Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like a lot of people went into the movie with an idea in their head that went something like: \\\"if this movie isn't a Rocky montage featuring Luke Skywalker\\, Star Wars is dead to me\\\".\\n\\nIf that's you\\, don't see it.  This movie is a story about personal failure\\, and how a mans worth is not the sum of his worst failures.\\n\\nAlso\\, there are some things that happen that don't \\\"make sense\\\".  Most of those things are nods to the ret-conned star wars expanded universe\\, and in my eyes its the movie makers extending an olive branch to lifelong die hard fans as if to say \\\"we don't hate you\\, we did what we had to do.\\\"\\n\\nBottom line: if you've ever liked star wars\\, go see it.  I think it's really good.  If you don't go looking for what you want\\, and take in the story for what it is\\, I think you will like it too.","true":true}
