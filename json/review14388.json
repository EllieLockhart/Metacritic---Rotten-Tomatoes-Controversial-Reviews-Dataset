Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for star wars following the force awakens and rogue one\\, but I cant recommend this film. Most of the story is pointless and everything seems superficial. The plot is full of plot holes that even the force cannot plug. The story is definitely aimed at children and is very simplistic. A supremely pants rehash of the empire strikes back. Star Wars is terminally ill\\, if not dead.","true":true}
