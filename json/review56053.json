Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I loved Star Wars like since I was a little kid and so many things in this movie just didn't quit connect with me.\\nWhy didn't Holdo tell Phoe the plan so Finn didn't have to go on that useless mission?\\nJust so he can slap Phasma? \\nWhy do the switch from resistance to rebels mid film?.\\nWhy did Rose stop Finn from destroying the cannon which destroyed the base.\\nHow are they so happy at the end of the film when like 150 men died. While at the beginning of the film Phoe get's slapped for it. but at least he destroyed a dreadnought.\\nhow does ray know the force after one training session \\nhow did Snoke get killed so easily if he is so powerful\\nhow does Yoda still has powers as a ghost\\nwhy is there no use of Y-wings","true":true}
