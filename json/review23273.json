Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Lots of action\\, laughs\\, all things I thought I knew would happen were different. And shockingly\\, in the 25 years or so since the events of Return of the Jedi\\, some of the original characters change. <gasp> I don\u2019t know why people are surprised and\/or angered by this. I have read some reviews hating on Disney for \u201cruining the franchise\u201d\\, don\u2019t understand that either\\, Star Wars was never super dark\\, super deep\\, and always had plenty of cheese\\, it never took itself too seriously. I liked the deeper exploration of the force and how close the light and dark seem. In the theater I was in people were laughing and clapping or cheering throughout the whole movie. I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed in the least.","true":true}
