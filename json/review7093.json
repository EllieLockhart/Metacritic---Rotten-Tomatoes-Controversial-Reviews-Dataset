Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Emotionally impactful\\, epic in scope\\, it hits all the right notes. Fantastic performances from the main cast add weight to a story that twists and turns. Director Rian Johnson resisted the temptation to add a derivative story heavy on fan service. What we get instead are interesting story arcs\\, real suspense and the emotion behind action that makes us care about Star Wars.","true":true}
