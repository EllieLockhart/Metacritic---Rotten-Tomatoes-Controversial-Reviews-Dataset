Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the Force Awakens was an anomaly\\, in that it was pretty terrible. Rogue One was decent\\, so I expected The Last Jedi to be at least as good as Rogue One. I was wrong. The Last Jedi is not only the worst Star Wars movie made (and that includes the terrible prequels)\\, but it\u2019s one of the worst movies ever made. I almost walked out of it. I won\u2019t be watching these terrible movies anymore. How sad Disney was able to destroy such a beloved franchise. ","true":true}
