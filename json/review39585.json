Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was what I hoped to be the redeeming soul of this great franchise. Instead I'm dragged through all the things that made me hate the last 4 films excluding Rouge One. Gimpy CGI\\, random characters that pop up with no real redeeming qualities that try to steal the spotlight\\, and cliffhangers that end with a flop instead of well tied in story. Let's not forget the insufferable Mary-Sue and the continued bastardized version of the force that keeps hanging about like a sentient ghost instead of a force that connects all things. A major disappointment and failing to the Star Wars community.","true":true}
