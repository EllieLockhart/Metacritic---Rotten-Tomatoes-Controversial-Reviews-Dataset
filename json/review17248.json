Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really wanted to like this movie\\, especially after the disappointing rehash that was \\\"The Force Awakens\\\".  No spoilers here for those who haven't seen it yet but the storyline\\, scripting and dialogue are all weak at best but another hodge podge thrown together at its worst.  It takes some truly likable characters from episode VII and significantly diminishes them.  See it in the theater for the wonderful visuals but don't expect a good\\, coherent story\\, good dialogue or the epicness that is the hallmark of a good Star Wars movie.","true":true}
