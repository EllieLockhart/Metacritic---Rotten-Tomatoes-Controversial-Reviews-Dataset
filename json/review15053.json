Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left Star Wars 8 soooooo disappointed.........\\n\\nThe visuals were good\\, even liked the old throw back puppet. BUT...\\n\\n-Story was really bad\\n-No character development (between 7-8)\\n-Story line doesn't jive with the past movies at all. (Luke and Kylo)\\n-Everything from the past is irreverent. Everyone died for nothing seems like.\\n-Snoke was pointless\\, Vader was supposed to be the best and now everyone has super powers.(Rey) \\n\\n\\nJust sucked....","true":true}
