Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what a hot mess. The best I could describe this was Harry Potter meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I was so looking forward to this and what a disappointment. From the bad acting to the Voldemort looking Snoke. Leia has no powers and yet she magically flies through space after she gets blown out of her ship. The girl with the purple hair\\, wtf were they thinking? Did a 10 year old write your lines? It only took half the fleet getting blown up before she got her head out of her derri\u00e8re. This is 2.5 hours of my life that I'll never get back and that doesn't include the standing in line. I can't say that I'm looking forward to anything else in the franchise. I wish I could leave some positive points but this movie seemed like a mashup of bits. Met up with others in the theater that had similar comments. ;-(","true":true}
