Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst of the Star Wars movie from a director whose ego was more important than understanding the movie he was making. I pointless plot\\, complete lack of understanding of the characters\\, useless secondary plot to get other characters screen time\\, and countless other issues in an attempt to make Star Wars about more than just the Skywalker family. The problem there is that these trilogies are about the Skywalker family specifically. Rian appears to forget he is doing the 8th movie of a saga and not the first or second movie of a new property. In an attempt to make it so anyone can be special he casually forgets the premise of the jedi and that prior to Anakin they were not allowed to have families thus negating any ideas that the jedi were ever about a persons lineage. Overall if you want to see some decent special effects and admittedly slightly better acting\/dialog than a standard star wars movie\\, then you may like this movie. If you have any love of Star Wars\\, a novices understanding of storytelling\\, plot development\\, and pacing then you will likely see this movie for what it is\\, an embarrassment to the Star Wars universe. Yes I say that even having seen Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
