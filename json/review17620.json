Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is there a rating less than one star because TLJ deserves negative stars. At first I was just disappointed but as time goes on my anger builds. The disservice to Luke's character is criminal. The treatment of Leah's character is comical. The reinvention of Force abilities is dumbfounding. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson either have never seen a Star Wars movie or crapped all over the legacy on purpose. This is not the Star Wars movie you were looking for. I'm so angry with what they did to the franchise that I don't even know where to begin.","true":true}
