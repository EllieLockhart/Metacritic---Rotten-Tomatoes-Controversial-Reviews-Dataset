Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been to the premiere of every Star Wars film since I was 5 years old and thoroughly enjoyed all of them until this movie. It was merely ok and I probably only enjoyed it because it brought me back to the Star Wars universe I have loved all my life...but I left greatly disappointed. A friend who went to the 1:30am showing saw audiences leaving earlier showings and described it as watching people leaving a funeral. The feel of the movie was not right and I blame that on the director. The story and mood of the film felt out of place in many parts with Star Wars canon. Some movie lines led me thinking I was watching Space Balls instead of Star Wars. Other parts were just not believable with the rest of Star Wars lore and felt like great contradictions to character elements. Shame on you Ms. Kennedy for letting this movie be released under such poor direction. Please help us JJ Abrams you are our only hope...in rescuing the final movie in this trilogy series.
