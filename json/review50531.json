Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 Star for visuals\\, everything else is a disappointment. By far the worst Star Wars film to date\\, can't believe everything from The Force Awakens (which I actually enjoyed) gets thrown out the window completely for the sake of \\\"Let the past die\\\" just a stupid reason to cover up bad story telling.  So many wasted opportunities and characters\\, what was the point in Captain Phasma and Snoke? absolutely no point at all. Not looking forward towards Episode IX now after this disaster of a movie.","true":true}
