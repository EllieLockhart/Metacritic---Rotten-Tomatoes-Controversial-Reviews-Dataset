The writers have completely and utterly destroyed everything that you learned to love in the first game. I don't care about character's sexual orientation - that personally isn't something that is on my radar\\, or something I'd care about; love who you love and all that.\r\rBut the game is pointless due to its story - rather than create a worthy successor to the first\\, ND have put forward a nonsensical and boring story - and let's no mention the numerous misleading pieces before released; making it seem that Joel will be in it. I wouldn't be surprised if there will be a huge influx of refund requests to this alone.\r\rI tried to laugh off all the comments about the 10\/10 reviews being \\\"paid off\\\" - but you really start to wonder if there is some truth to this\\, the further you get into this game.\r\rAs a die hard TLOU fan\\, I cannot recommend this game at all - just keep on walking folks\\, let the ending of TLOU be the end.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
