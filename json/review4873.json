Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Considering the chance they had to give the most beloved movie trilogy ever an absolutely amazing sequel; this was a very upsetting and even slightly traumatizing experience. I'd prefer a monthly painful prostate exam before existing in a universe where Star Wars is handled with such irresponsibility.\\n\\nI'll never watch it again\\, twice was 2 times too much. I've fallen into a deep depression. :( <\/3","true":true}
