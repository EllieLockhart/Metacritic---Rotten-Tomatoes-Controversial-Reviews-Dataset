Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lifelong hardcore star wars fan here. I didn't love this movie. It took a lot of admirable risks\\, but many of them just didn't play out well for me. I want to love this film but I just can't look past certain things about it. Force Awakens was better in basically every single way. This movie had so much potential and certain parts definitely lived up and other parts just fell flat on its face. Overall\\, it's a really enjoyable fun movie but in the grand scheme of Star Wars\\, it was just good\\, not great.","true":true}
