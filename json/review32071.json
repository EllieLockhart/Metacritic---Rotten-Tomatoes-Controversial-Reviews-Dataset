Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***SPOILERS***\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nOk\\, great movie - I love the use of light and colours to represent the conflict between light and dark and the balance or middle (they used grey).\\nSome plot points were silly\\, like Finn and Roses mission it had no effect in the end.\\nLuke... why kill him off WHY!!! We didn't even get to see him fight like a bad-ass. After almost 40 years of waiting not ONE lightsaber battle with him.\\nThe most annoying thing about this movie is the 2 BIGGEST mysteries introduced in the last movie - Rey's parents and Snoke - both lead to no where - Rey's parents reveal was tossed away like nothing (and the reveal was nothing) and Snoke was killed like he was nothing as well\\, we didn't even find out about his story - he's just a dude in a golden gown.\\nAg\\, Star Wars fans are always picky - you can't please them no matter what you do - it was a great movie on its own but have some more epic moments in the 3rd film please - let Luke and Mace Windu pop out of no where and kick some ass or get Obi Wan and Anakin to have their moment - I don't know. Make it epic and give some fan service and they'll shut up. \\n4 Stars for a great action packed movie on its own. There are no more burning questions or mysteries of huge importance and no major twist like the iconic \\\"I am your father\\\" scene. Go watch it anyways.","true":true}
