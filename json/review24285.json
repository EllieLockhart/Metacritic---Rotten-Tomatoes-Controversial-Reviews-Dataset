Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Messy\\, overlong\\, ungraceful\\, self-consciously right-on and overstuffed in the manner of big budget pictures nowadays\\, in a way the earlier films really weren't. It's made for a generation of moviegoers who care little about form and even less about storytelling\\, and that's a shame\\, because there are a handful of moments that stand among the best of the series. The woeful gambling planet is not one of them.\\n\\nSerious audience-alienating missteps include Rian Johnson's introduction to the franchise of petty pedantic little details (this is the first Star Wars in which space petrol and parking fines are not only a concern\\, but major plot points) and deeply unsatisfactory character developments (everyone involved in the Leia-Holdo-Poe story arc comes out looking like an a-hole). Annoying characters like Rose and DJ are introduced at the expense of other\\, potentially more interesting\\, characters. It's technically the day after the events of TFA\\, but the fact that Finn is a Stormtrooper deserter is barely explored\\, apart from his underwhelming confrontation with Phasma. As my g\/f asked afterwards: \\\"Was I supposed to know who that silver woman Stormtrooper was?\\\" That's how sloppily these movies are put together now. No one seems to know how to set a thing up and provide a pay-off anymore.","true":true}
