Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m gonna keep it short\\, is it the best Star Wars movie ever? Probably not\\, HOWEVER it\u2019s full of turns and unexpected plot twists that any Star Wars Fan will enjoy. Go see it for yourself and may the force be with you! ","true":true}
