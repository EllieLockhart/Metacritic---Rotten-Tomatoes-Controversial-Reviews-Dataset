Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Epic! Seriously Epic! Reminded me of Star Wars in ways TFA didn't. This was no carbonite copy remake like TFA. This was fresh\\, engaging and so satisfying while still bringing back that original Star Wars nostalgia! As close as they have come to surpassing the originals. Reminded me of when my parents first showed me A New Hope\\, Empire and Jedi. The one gripe I have is with the Finn\/Rose side quest. It felt Forced. Loved Rose as a character and her with Finn was great! Did not love their story arc. Fortunately the rest of the movie was so well done that it was easy to overlook. Luke\/Rey\/Kilo story was amazing on every level. Poe and Leia's dynamic was great. Poe feels like he will be made to take over the resistance in her place. Loved that with all the hype about who Snoke is or might be that ultimately Snoke is just Snoke. The way the Emperor was just the Emperor in the originals. No over explanation on where he came from or how he was so powerful. Maybe that gets explained in future films\\, maybe not. I'm glad they focused on the other characters. If Empire is 5 stars for me and Attack of the Clones is 1 then this movie is 4-1\/2 stars.","true":true}
