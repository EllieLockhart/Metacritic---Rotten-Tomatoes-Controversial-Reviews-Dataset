For the first time\\, a game has managed to make me deeply regret buying it. I didn't believe the negative reviews. I was so naive.You play as a crazy psycho with a stabby knife\\, uncontested and unchallenged. The story is consistently stagnated as it plops you down at your spawn point and the game stares blankly back at you as you are given all the time in the world to scour every corner of an oversized map\\, scavenging bread crumbs across an entire city with no mention of the mission you're on. All the parts you need to upgrade your character are spread out in the city of Seattle and has absolutely nothing to do with your end goal. The hours I spent finding parts could have easily been cut in half if this game followed any kind of progression logic like the first game. Your ingame partner\\, whoever it is as its constantly changing between Joel and Dina and whatever other unimportant crew of side characters\\, is never challenging you as Ellie did in the first game. You don't have to worry about escorting them through the terrain as they brainlessly follow you around\\, climb and jump and talk mechanically about their past\\, all the while you'll be wishing you could push them off a ledge for some peace and quiet. An absolute joke compared to the first game where your companion was more than a ladder climbing npc. I haven't even touched upon the biggest oopsie\\, which is trying to fit two narratives into one title. The constant flipping of perspective will give you backlash and - honestly- I felt pretty disrespected throughout the entire thing. By the end credits\\, I had a slight sense of what the writers were trying to achieve\\, but did that warrant an entire game? Couldn't all of that been established in the first 2 hours of game play? How on earth did I just spend 6 ingame days playing as two different characters just to reach a conclusion that could have happened upon their first meeting? Come on\\, what a joke. The whole game is a joke. At any moment someone will find an easteregg cutscene that explains the story was all a bad dream and Ellie didn't just spend a week chasing the mailman. The only joy this game brought me was finishing it and knowing I never have to play it ever again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
