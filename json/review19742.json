Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was amazing how fast I went from wanting to see this film\\, to sitting in the theater gleefully anticipating Mr. Plinkett's review of this film.  This film's worst offense is that it makes it painfully apparent that there is no planned cohesiveness between entries in the series.  The movie drops it's predecessor's established plot points in favor of new ones that aren't particularly interesting\\, ultimately leaving you unsatisfied and completely zapping you of any enthusiasm you might have had for future installments.  A major missfire that leaves you begging for JJ Abrams to put this humpty dumpty back together again.","true":true}
