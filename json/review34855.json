Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The excessive joking made it a poor attempt at a marvel movie\\, Rey had very little personal growth and her growth in the force was exponential without any work\\, why did they save the animals but leave the slave children\\, Finn clearly has deep feelings for Rey and shows no real interest in Rose yet somehow now they are in love? This list of problems just goes on from there.","true":true}
