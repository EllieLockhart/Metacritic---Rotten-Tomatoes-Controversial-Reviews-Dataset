Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was good. It had its flaws\\, but so does every Star Wars movie. The comedy went a little overboard sometimes but overall it was good\\, the characters had some growing pains but that\u2019s natural for a story\\, and some of the plot you go WTF and really?? \\, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. People are mainly mad because they expected to get everything answered but only a few things do and also the movie (as Luke says) doesn\u2019t go the way people think. But there were a lot of cool things to this film. It had great cinematography\\, nice character development and some cool scenes. Don\u2019t listen to the bandwagon consensus that this movie is worse than any of the prequels. ","true":true}
