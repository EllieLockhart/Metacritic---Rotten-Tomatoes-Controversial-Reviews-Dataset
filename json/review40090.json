Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the typical Star wars movie with good vs bad distinctions. The grey area is where this excels. Many star war's fans won't like it due this departure\\, but I found the new direction refreshing instead of rehashing prior material. A must see!","true":true}
