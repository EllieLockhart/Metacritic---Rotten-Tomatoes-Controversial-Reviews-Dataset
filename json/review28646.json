Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros - \\nOne of the best lightsaber duels in the franchise. \\nExcellent use of color.\\n\\nCons -\\nEverything else: dialogue\\, plot holes\\, even music\\, was complete garbage or forgettable at best. I may seriously never watch another Star Wars movie outside of the original trilogy again (which it also managed to ruin to a degree\\, knowing that this is where to story now goes)\\, it was that bad.","true":true}
