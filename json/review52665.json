Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All stars awarded are for visual and audio which were amazing as to be expected. However the plot of the trilogy and series suffered from this movie. Some plot points were novel however the execution took no heed of continuity and so leave a sour taste in the viewers mouth when considerations are made for this movie in context of the trilogy or universe it is in. Some issues could be derivative of The Force Awakens however I still feel that if executed well they could have got around these. In addition there were several character choices which minimalised the impact they desired to have. Finally the humour was often offputting and unnecessary with few moments not feeling forced or cringe worthy.","true":true}
