Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is such an amazing movie. I had expectations going in\\, and of course there have been fan theories since the release of The Force Awakens\\, but I was surprised at just how blown away I was. Are there certain things I wish would've happened\\, or a few small scenes that could've been changed? Yes\\, but the entire movie was presented in a way that makes you want to experience the story instead of critique or find flaws. Absolutely phenomenal.","true":true}
