Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Carrie Fisher's best performance as Leia. That alone is worth it. But\\, without spoiling anything\\, the story\\, which may be controversial to some\\, worked for me. Everyone put in a brilliant acting performance. The movie was visually stunning as well. Not just the typical \\\"giant yet minutely detailed ships\\\" but the whole thing is cinematically beautiful. I loved it\\, though\\, if you were an admirer of Carrie Fisher the real life human as well as the iconic character she played\\, bring some tissues. Overall\\, this may be my favorite of the films\\, or tied with Empire\\, which was the best of the Original Trilogy.","true":true}
