Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had to create an account to add my 1\/2 star this movie deserved.  Critics must have been smoking the green money Disney sent out to them.   My rage only increased as the time passed after seeing this movie.   So much so that I wrote a 10 page outline\/script for the movie in maybe 4 HOURS that blows this crap away.   if you want to see it go to YouTube and search Last Jedi Fan alternative","true":true}
