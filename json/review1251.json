Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A profoundly stupid movie\\, filled with the dumbest characters and plot this side of Transformers. This movie is a hateful destruction of a once beloved franchise. Even more damning; it leaves nothing to look forward to in the future. Everything that the characters have fought for\\, built\\, or accomplished in the past 7 movies has been torn down\\, smashed to pieces\\, and burned to nothing. Star Wars may not be dead\\, but my love for it certainly is.","true":true}
