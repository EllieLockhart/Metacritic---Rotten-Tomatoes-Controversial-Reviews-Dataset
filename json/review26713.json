Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok the movie could have been great. It has its moments and I wish it could have been better. Still no reason for Rey being op\\, the \\\"action\\\" is bland\\, Luke is portrayed as a old worn out man\\, this could have been interesting but the reasoning behind it is really pathetic\\, (going gets tough\\, Quit) its not the boy who lost everything and set out on revenge against the empire to fix it. \\n\\nAll in all it is just a mediocre movie\\, and because it is a star wars movie I must hold it to higher standard\\, and give it a 1\/5","true":true}
