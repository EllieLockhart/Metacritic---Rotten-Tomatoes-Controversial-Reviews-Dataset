Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When luke threw the lightsaber\\, i knew niether Johnson\\,nor disney\\,had any respect for lifelong star wars fans.It had some good moments\\,but horrendous\\,incredibly misplaced humor\\,glaring plot holes and straight up moments of disrespect to the lore of star wars and the fans\\,have killed my enthusiasm for future star wars even more than the prequels did.","true":true}
