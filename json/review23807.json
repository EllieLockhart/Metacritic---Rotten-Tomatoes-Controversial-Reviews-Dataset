Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was character assassinated to make a bland Mary Sue look good. The Mary Sue gets force powers without having to work for them and is better than everybody. Meanwhile\\, painfully unfunny comedy happens. I won't pay money for another Star Wars film.","true":true}
