Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The true sequel. People that doesn't like it doesn't deserve to have toys from Star Wars. The new movie breaks the inner structure of Star Wars stories while portraying the best evolution of characters we know. In the human side\\, this movie tryumphs. The Force is no longer a commodity of a family or royalty\\, it's everyone's and nobody's. This movie has made Star Wars better.","true":true}
