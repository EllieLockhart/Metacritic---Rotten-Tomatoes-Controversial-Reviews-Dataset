Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Bad movie.\\ndisney destroyed Star Wars\\ni don't know how TOMATOMETER can be 93%\\, did disney paid to rotten tomatoes?
