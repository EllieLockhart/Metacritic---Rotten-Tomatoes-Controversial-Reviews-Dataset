Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible plot\\, horrible characters\\, bad jokes.  This movie had it all!  I hated what they did to Luke.  And\\, why couldn't Akbar have sacrificed himself instead of purple-hair-lady?  Would have been a bettrer scene than his 1\/2 second death.\\n\\nI saw this movie on opening weekend and the thing that sticks with me the most is the Rose character.  My\\, my what an awful\\, throwaway character.  Poorly written and poorly acted.  Makes Jar Jar look like a thespian.  She delivers some of the worst lines of the movie.\\n \\nAnd\\, Luke milks and drinks from sea cow teats.","true":true}
