Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney butchered Luke's character and with it\\, the Star Wars universe - he alone personifies the jedi and the light side in the clearest way\\, yet in this movie was portrayed as a weak old fool\\, who slipped casually into the dark side to kill ben solo\\, his sister's and one of his best friend's son!! That's like writing a sequel to the bible\\, where we find out\\, that jesus is really a bad guy and the previous books were BS. You wouldnt see many christians flocking to buy the blasphemous piece of scribble! Disney - you are mishandling Star Wars\\, fix it\\, or lose it to ambiguity.","true":true}
