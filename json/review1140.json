Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who compares this movie to the prequels losses all credibility. It\u2019s laughable that people believe the originals were deep when they were nothing more than space soap-operas. The die hard fans would be upset with academy award winning acting with state of the art special effects. The fans who gave the horrible reviews will be the ones seeing the next installment on opening night \ud83d\ude44","true":true}
