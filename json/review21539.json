Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would say this movie ruined Star Wars for me. But I won't even give it that much credit. The originals are still great. The pre-quals were bad\\, but far better than this SJW crap. I will just move on and act like these new movies don't exist. Rogue One was alright. The Last Jedi canto bites the big one.","true":true}
