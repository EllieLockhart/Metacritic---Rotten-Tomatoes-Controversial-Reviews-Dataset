Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a mess of a movie\\, much less a Star Wars movie. Totally inconsistent tone (Harry Potter magic goat chase vs. people getting chopped in half and blended into salsa on screen). Depressing\\, needlessly nihilistic. Poe is completely out of character\\, Holdo is a terrible commander (where she isn't outright dumb).\\n\\nBut the worst crime is the complete destruction of Luke\\, ie\\, one of the finest heroes in fiction. Now he'll always be a coward\\, a child murderer\\, and a fool. Thanks for that.","true":true}
