Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I can\u2019t believe I waited 4 years only to not play as Ellie! Who on earth thought it would be enjoyable to play as Abby\\, why on earth would we want to play as the character we hate? Also she is the most lifeless character I\u2019ve ever seen in any game. I bought the game to continue the story from the first one\\, you literally called it part 2 to continue Joel and Ellie\u2019s story\\, last time I checked Abby wasn\u2019t in part 1\\, and speaking of the story who on earth wrote that\\, you tried to replicate the relationship between Joel and Ellie with Abby and Lev and that did not work at all as both Abby and Lev are such terrible and uninteresting characters. Also what on earth was that ending we didn\u2019t even get to kill Abby! Why would you let her live\\, or at least give us a choice to kill her or spare her. This game was supposed to be about Ellie why weren\u2019t we told anything about her backstory with her Mum? Why didn\u2019t we see Ellie first meeting Marline? Why did we play as Joel\u2019s killer? Whoever thought that was a good idea for the story should be fired. This game has terrible story structure\\, and the game overall was way too long.The gameplay was great I really liked the dodge mechanic that was an outstanding feature\\, and I love that you can change the reticule to a simple dot as I didn\u2019t really like the old one in the first game\\, the combat system was great too a good selection of weapons. Gameplay was overall great.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
