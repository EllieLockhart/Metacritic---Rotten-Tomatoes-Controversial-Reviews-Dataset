Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only positive is that Lucas can no longer be ashamed of the prequels.  For all the faults of the prequels at least the store made some sense.  TLJ is just plain stupid.  The whole codebreaker plot was the dumbest thing I have ever watched.  Luke - one of the more iconic characters of the series completely ruined.  This is the first Star Wars movie I can honestly say I actually found myself losing interest and not paying attention - the story was just so horrible.  I really hope EP9 redeems itself - can't let Star Wars die like this.","true":true}
