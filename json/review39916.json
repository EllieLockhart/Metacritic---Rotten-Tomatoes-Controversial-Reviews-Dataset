Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie of them all folks.  Extremely disappointed in this film.\\n\\nHow did this film get a 93% or 8.1\/10 average from critics?  I think it has become painfully obvious now that Disney has paid off the critics.\\n\\nWhen was the last time you had a huge disconnect between the critics and the audience.  Audience is at 56% and I am sure it will continue to plummet once the paid reviewers stop posting.\\n\\nBottom line\\, we can't trust the critics\\, we can't trust Disney\\, and I will never watch another Star Wars movie directed by Rian Johnson.","true":true}
