Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't care for Star Wars anymore after seeing this movie. All this time Yoda as a ghost can use lightning bolts to strike at others. This just shows how horrible and uncaring he is for not striking down Darth Vader in the Return of the Jedi when he could easily do so. All of these characters are a bad example for our children.","true":true}
