Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the vacuum this movie is fine. It is well made\\, it has some great moments\\, and great characters. But it is a Star Wars movie. It abandons much of what it means to be a Star Wars movie. Luke Skywalker is supposed to be our hero\\, not someone who hides from his own mistakes. It also takes a great villain built up in the first movie and kills him off easily\\, making it clear that the director just did not like the character. The real problem is that this movie is clearly not part of a story arc that started with the first movie. This is a standalone movie made to follow the previous movie. It is a sequel. That's not what a Trilogy is supposed to be and that's not what a Star Wars movie is supposed to be. That falls squarely in the responsibility of Kathleen Kennedy. There needed to be a plan and an overall story that each director worked with in and that does not seem to be what happened. Say what you will about the Marvel movies but they are planned out and clearly all part of one continuing Saga. The Last Jedi is merely a sequel and abandons many of the Hallmarks of what Star Wars movies have always been.","true":true}
