Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you actually know anything about the star wars universe its EAsy to see  more plot holes\\, destruction of heroes via extremely out of character actions\\, and one of the most distasteful blasts of forced POLITICAL opinion I've seen in my life. Even ignoring all OF that\\, the awful WRITINg via a painfully OBVIOUS mary sue and non-progressing story line make THIS my last star wars film until real fans pick up on the story. THIS is bad fanfiction by politically polarized Hollywood children... AND it hits my CHILDHood hard as I watch them destroy this universe. Trash.","true":true}
