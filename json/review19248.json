Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a perfect film.  But with the level of ownership that Star Wars fans impose on their beloved franchise there will never again be a universally loved Star Wars film.  That being said it was a triumph.  It took every expectation and flipped them.  The only disappointments I had when leaving the theater were selfish ones.  With the \\\"end\\\" of Luke Skywalker and the real life death of Carrie Fisher we are left with no living members of our original trio.  With the death of Snoke and the virtual destruction of the Resistance the audience is left with no true course set.  What happens next? We truly do not know. I find this to be a truly unique and exciting place for the franchise to be.","true":true}
