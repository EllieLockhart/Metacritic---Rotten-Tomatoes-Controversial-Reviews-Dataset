Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was much better than Abrams catastrophe but it was too convoluted in one movie.  Finn was on a quest to find the gatekeeper aka Ghostbuster driven to destroy the Flux Capacitor aka Back to the Future.  Maybe the Director Rian Johnson was a fan of the 80's movies but it wasn't necessary.  Luke Skywalker was able to provide the funny stances and deliver his normal uncanny faith in the Jedi to give a better premise to the storyline.  I was surprised to see Yoda brought into the storyline\\, I was also hoping to see other older Jedi's but it was wishful thinking.  Throughout the movie I kept reminiscing the original trilogy\\, scenes from Revenge of the Jedi are bestowed in much of the movie.  I excepted Leia to die earlier that she never had any Jedi powers so what gives? I sometimes wish these movies are never made\\, at least Lucas gave us better new characters and fun storyline.  Overall it was enjoyable but nothing great.","true":true}
