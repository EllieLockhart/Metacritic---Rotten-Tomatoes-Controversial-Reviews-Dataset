Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the best Star Wars film ever. The acting the cinematography the score was perfect. It's not a remake of empire which is great. All these fan boys who are hating on the film need to get their head out of the OT ass put their big boy pants on and realize these movies are not about Luke Leia and Han. Every character has a story arc that is resolved by the end of the film. Luke and Kylo had the best story. The fighting was great. This movie had me laughing and in tears throughout the whole movie. The fan boys can take their EU books and run home and ill enjoy the best Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
