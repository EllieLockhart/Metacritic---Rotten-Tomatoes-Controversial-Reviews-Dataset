Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start by saying I LOVED \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"!\\nThat movie set up the new trilogy so well. Emotional\\, exciting\\, true to the originals\\, great new characters\\, lots of questions teased.\\nIt had so much potential!\\n\\nI was really excited for Episode VIII but \\\"Last Jedi\\\" completely WASTED that potential!\\nThis was a steaming pile of s***! It not only didn't answer the questions from Force Awakens but ruined the new and classic characters.\\nIt also introduced completely superfluous (an annoying!) characters.\\n\\nSo damn disappointing!","true":true}
