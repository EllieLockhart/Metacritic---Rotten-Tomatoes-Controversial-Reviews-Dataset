Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the good site\\, this movie has some breathtaking shots and looks good.\\nIf you go in mindlessly and just want to see another action movie. Fine.\\n\\nBut if you are interested in anything like plot\\, character development or a movie that is just a movie and not a statement about society\\, then this movie is absolutely not for you.\\n\\nThere are so many plotholes. Admiral gender studies not telling there is a plan\\, enabling the whole b plot of the movie to happen\\, has to be the worst writing I have ever seen. \\nJumping into the middle of space (near the hidden base) instead of in front of the hidden base\\, does only make sense\\, if they already knew they are going to be tracked\\, which they did not. So there is no reason for that\\, except bad writing.\\n\\nI am all about strong female lead characters. I could not care less about her gender or race. \\nBut I fail to imagine a single character in any universe\\, that fails less than Rey. Except maybe in the anime one punch man\\, but even he explains that he had to train a whole lot.\\nGrowing up on a desert planet? Oh she can swim. \\nZero training in lightsaber combat? Never seen any of the 7 traditional lightsaber forms? No problem\\, defeats Kylo\\, the guards\\, Luke or really anything that stands in her way.\\nNearly zero training in handling the force? \\nLet her use all the most overpowered abilities you could imagine. Also it\u00b4s no problem lifting all those boulders\\, while luke could barely pull out his lightsaber out of the snow.\\nShe is also known for: Flying nearly perfectly without training\\, repairing stuff better than Han inside of the falcon\\, translating wookie to Luke (not like Luke could not understand him)\\, defeating enemys that have trained their whole life\\, everybody liking her the moment they see her and so on.\\n\\nAll this\\, with her only conflict being her not knowing who her parents are. She later gets told that her parents are no one except for drunks that left her. Which doesn\u00b4t affect her that much at all.\\n\\nI do not mind characters being strong\\, but most of the time there is a) a development\\, seen in for example Lukes training and inner struggle or b) a tradeoff that makes there character weak in other ways. This is often seen in users of the dark force\\, as they are usually stronger but arrogant or you know\\, \\\"evil\\\".\\nBut no\\, nothing. Rey truly deserves the mary sue claim. Even Anikin\\, who was said to be kind of the forces messiah\\, had his fair share of tradeoff becoming the villain.\\n\\nLiterally every man shown in TLJ is either an angry\\, salty or hotheaded child like the general\\, Poe or kylo\\, gets killed of like admiral Ackbar or gets portayed in a very bad and funny way like for example Luke the old eremit like man drooling milk and trying to kill younglings or Finn being a traitor and coward again trying to flee\\, which is actually reasonable concidering admiral gender studies plan was literally do nothing. At least that is what she tells. Finn even was not allowed to have his heroic moment\\, because of Rose falling in love with him. \\nAdditionally\\, what was this kiss? He clearly did not want this? Is this okay now?\\n\\nYou see the movie follows an political agenda. Females are strong and men are evil. Which would be fine if this was just some sort of :\\\"This is how it is at the moment\\\" . I mean this could clearly happen in some sort of way. But you can clearly see that this is not part of the movie. It is the movie. The whole \\\"plot\\\"suffers because of this. Story and plot has to come first. If you want to get a message into it\\, do it afterwards and not beforehand.\\n\\nDisney really needs to stop switching leading roles in producing movies. A main problem being Kathleen Kennedy\\, changing her mind way too often.\\n\\nThere are plenty of youtube videos. Male\/femaly youtubers. Book authors and so on critizing this movie for a reason and in an objective way. You may still have fun watching it and of course it might be likeable to some. But it is truly one of those movies poorly executed. Then again\\, the pictures you get are awesome. So visually its perfectly fine in my opinion.","true":true}
