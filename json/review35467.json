Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi doesn't give a damn about your predictions and fan theories\\, and that is it's greatest strength. It innovates and pushes Star Wars out of it's comfort zone\\, and if you don't mind getting out of that comfort zone\\, this movie is a stellar addition to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
