Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film kills off everyone of note\\, like it is the last movie of the triology. The next story will therefore be full of people who no one knows and involve lots of back story explaination. Not exactly what anyone wants for a trilogy.\\nImagine what would have happened to Marvel if they killed of all the X men in the first film\\, as the writer wanted something \\\"fresh\\\"? Disney may as well of created another SciFi series and saved its money.","true":true}
