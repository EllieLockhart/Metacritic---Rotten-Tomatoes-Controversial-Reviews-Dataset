Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yuck.\\n\\nOne of the stupidest movies I've ever seen in my life.  Too many annoyingly cute animals.  This is Star Wars\\, not Pokemon.  All the men were weak\\, and all the women were self righteous and condescending.  Did Dr. Phil write this movie?  \\n\\nThe main character wasn't challenged in any way\\, and overcame nothing.  A beloved character\\, Luke Skywalker was destroyed.  All the \\\"jokes\\\" were juvenile and stupid.  I will never see another Rian Johnson movie again.","true":true}
