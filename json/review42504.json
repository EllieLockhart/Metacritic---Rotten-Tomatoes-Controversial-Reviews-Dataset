Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing I grew up watching these movies and this one definitely did not disappoint. I really like all of the different relationships and dinamics between all of the characters a lot. To me it's like reliving part of my childhood and brings back so many great memories of these characters I have loved my whole life. I have seen a lot of people giving bad reviews of this movie and it really bothers me so do yourself a favor don't listen or read them just go watch this movie with an open mind and enjoy the ride. We live in a generation of to many critics and not enough creative people.","true":true}
