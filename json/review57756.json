Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very disjointed plot. it often feels like too much is happening but at he end of it all it feels like nothing much happened at all. tonally confused. the humor tends to take you out of the universe rather than add anything to the characters. worst thing about it: it builds off of almost nothing that's established in the previous film or anything that was established in canon between the two movies. as an avid star wars fan who went to Celebration and has been actively excited for this movie since January\\, i'm gravely disappointed. I was ready to be shocked and excited and shed all my preconceptions. This movie was *not* it. The Force Awakens was better.","true":true}
