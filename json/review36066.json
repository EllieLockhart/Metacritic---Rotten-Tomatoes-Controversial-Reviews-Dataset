Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi tells us to forget the past and move forward with these characters. In 30 years time\\, kids watching Star Wars won't care about how they have changed small things regarding the force etc. they will see a Star Wars Movie through and through. It has everything.","true":true}
