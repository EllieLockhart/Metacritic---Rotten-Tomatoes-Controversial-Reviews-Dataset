Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost as good as the prequels. It was as if they were listening and reading all the fan theories and did the opposite. A fan of star wars will be disappointed and a super star wars nerd will be physically upset with this movie. I am not going to spoil this movie for you\\, but if you were on the fence about going don't. Read a synopsis about and wait till you can stream it later. Save your money\\, Disney has enough.","true":true}
