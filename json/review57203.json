Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This marks the beggining of the end for SW. It is now mutated into a deformed cousin of Star Wars that pays no respect to established lores and character depth and integrity that we've come to love about Star Wars. Rian Johnson's \\\"vision\\\" and\\,  Kathleen Kennedy are AIDS to Star Wars. PERIOD.","true":true}
