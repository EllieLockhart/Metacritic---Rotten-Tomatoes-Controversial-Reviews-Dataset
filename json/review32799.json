Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was fucking spectacular with great characters\\, mind blowing action\\, spectacular visuals\\, a spectacular music score\\, this movie has twist they are awesome\\, Mark Hammil as Luke gives the best performance of his career and better than TFA ","true":true}
