Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had so much potential\\,  the force awakens gave them plenty to write about\\, original material.  Delve into Rey parents\\,  who Soke was\\,  Lukes return\\,  Fin becoming a leader\\,  on and on.   Ive been a fan from the begining\\, not a zealot\\, just a simple fan.   This movie was poorly made\\,  lazy story telling\\, plot holes every 15 minutes\\, bad jokes\\, no continuity from Awakens to this film and no continuity in the film it self\\, the only good thing is the special effects.   I wont add this movie to my DVD collection\\, kinda like all those star wars books at the book store that Disney ignored.  I will ignore this episode.  I really wanted to enjoy it","true":true}
