Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute shit.\\n\\nEnough plot holes to sink the Titanic. Suspension of belief disrupted more than once. Characters act out of place and motives are just muddied.\\n\\nThe movie tries to go too many directions at once and its overambition ruins it. Movie can't even be a standalone movie.","true":true}
