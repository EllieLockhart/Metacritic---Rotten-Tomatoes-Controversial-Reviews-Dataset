Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I rarely see movies in the theater\\, but the visuals and sound in these films are too good not to experience on the big screen. If you're looking for a feel good rom-com where everything works out in the end then this probably isn't for you\\, but if you liked The Force Awakens\\, you're going to love this. I thought it was awesome\\, but I like all the Star Wars movies so I'm probably biased. I'm just looking forward to having new films on a consistent basis for a long time to come. It's a great time to be a Star Wars fan!","true":true}
