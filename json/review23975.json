Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many Characters\\, Old & New\\, All Fighting For Screen-Time Leaves Us Chopping & Changing\\, Being Pulled So Many Places At Once. It Is A Struggle To Take It All In\\, But It Did Not Leave Me Drastically Disappointed. Many Action Sequences\\, Rescues\\, Love Interests\\, Losses\\, Defeats & Triumphs All Culminate For A Fantastic Adventure Ride. The Swashbuckling Nature Of This Saga Builds Characters\\, Old & New\\, Further. But Some Characters Have So Little Back Story (Snoke For Instance) It Is Hard To Understand How The Federation (& Dark Side) Ever Became So Powerful Again?? (With Dreadnoughts & Super Star Destroyers Etc) I Thought More Would Be Explained On This\\, But Other Than The Luke \/ Kylo Fall-Out Argument At The Temple\\, There Is Nothing Further Added..It's A Bit Disappointing\\, Because Then All Hell Breaks Lose When Characters We Know Little To Nothing About All Start Either Being Knocked Off\\, Or Become Incredibly Powerful & Rise Up Against This Almighty Power. You Cannot Just Ride The Story On The Back (History) Of Luke & Leia's Demise\\, With No Further Depth To Any Other Characters We Are Expected To Adopt In This New Saga. So The Saga Loses Steam Here\\, & All The CGi\\, Character Cameo's By Chewie\\, C3PO & R2D2 Cannot Add In Enough Weight-Laughs\\, But It Is Still A Quite Enjoyable Ride. Which I Guess Is The Ultimate Goal...Merchandise!!! Merchandise!!! Meeerrrchandise!!!! Particularly For All The New\\, Soon-To-Be Female Fans Loving All These Female Heroes..Saving The Boys\\, (Ie. Luke or Solo) Whom Are Old?? Outdated?? Where To Next I Wonder..-Sigh-","true":true}
