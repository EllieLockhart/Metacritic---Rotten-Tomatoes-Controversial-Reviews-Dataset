Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson\\,  you have not only failed yourself as a film maker\\, but you have failed over 40 years of science fiction lore and legacy.   What a horrible little hack you are.  The Last Jedi is a disgrace that will live on through the ages.   Shame on you!  RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
