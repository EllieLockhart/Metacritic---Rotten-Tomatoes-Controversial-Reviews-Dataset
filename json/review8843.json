Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the second movie of a trilogy it was great.  Force awakens felt like more of an ending to a story and this was a true handoff to the new characters.  Development was great\\, use of humor was good\\, and the storyline developed and moved at a great pace.  Really enjoyable movie.  Everyone in my group of eight really enjoyed it.","true":true}
