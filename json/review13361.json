Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it very much. As a long time fan of the series\\, it may not have hit all the notes I may have Wanted or Expected\\, but as a movie telling the story it was\\, it was a great time. And for all the complaints I may have\\, there are a equal and greater number of compliments.\\nYes it drags\\, and yes it's weird (even for Star Wars). But it's clever and funny and thought provoking. And I would see it again and again\\, in theaters as well as getting a copy for my home\\, because overall it was a good Star Wars addition to me. I can't wait to see what happens next.","true":true}
