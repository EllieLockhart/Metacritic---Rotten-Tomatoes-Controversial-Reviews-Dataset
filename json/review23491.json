Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie. Most negative scores from viewers are coming from all these theories they developed in their head since the last movie. The movie fell flat for them because their big theories didn't come true. Only complaints from me is it may have ran too long and Rose character was meh.","true":true}
