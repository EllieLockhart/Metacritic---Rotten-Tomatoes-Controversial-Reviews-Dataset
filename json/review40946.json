Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie didn't feel like a Star Wars film... Too much meandering and lack of depth to the story. There were also several story arcs set up in the Force Awakens which completely fell flat... Rey's parents\\, Luke\\, Snoke - all huge let downs...","true":true}
