{"101487":134124,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly do not know where to begin. I will start off by saying I was more excited for this movie than anybody\\, and wanted it to be great so bad\\, as it had tremendous potential as a Star Wars movie. Whatever I watched was certaintly not a Star Wars movie in any form at all\\, or even close. I have been a Star Wars fan my whole life\\, episodes 1-6 are not only my favorite movies\\, but they are a part of my life that brought me happiness and adventure all while being fun and cool. Even the force awakens\\, which clearly had its flaws\\, was a nice return and set up to 8 for what could've been great. What I just saw in the theatre was a complete trainwreck. Calling this movie a mess is truly an understatement\\, and that is simply sad and shocking to say. The last Jedi was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I cannot call it a Star Wars movie because it cannot be further from that. There is absolutely no way anyone can convince me that Rian Johnson had ever seen any of the 7 films prior to making this. There is just no way anyone who had seen and enjoyed those movies could have created this travesty of a mess. Literally everything about this movie is horrendous\\, and that is in no way an understatement. JJ Abrams certaintly was not perfect in 7\\, but it at least felt like Star Wars and provided us with some characters and plot mysteries that could have been explored and added on to in a great way in the next installment. Johnson not only dismissed this completely as if he's never seen 7\\, but he did it in a way that was so bad that it feels as if he reached down my throat during the film and ripped my heart out. Nothing makes remotely any sense\\, every single character is hard to watch\\, and the plot is literally the worst thing I've ever seen. I cannot understand how everyone at Lucasfilm allowed for this to happen. It is without a shadow of a doubt the end of Star Wars\\, and that is truly sad to say. Any true fan who walked out of that theatre felt disrespected\\, sad\\, and in utter disbelief. Mark Hamill waited 30 years to reprise his legendary role\\, and was made a complete mockery of. There are simply not enough words in the English language to express just how bad this was on every level\\, I could go on about every single scene\\, about how poorly everything was from the transitions to the dialogue. Shockingly bad to the point where I actually was in disbelief. People were looking around in the theatre to make sure what they were seeing was real and that they weren't dreaming\\, and sadly it was a real life nightmare unfolding before all of our eyes. Not a sound was made from anyone as the movie ended\\, just sheer disbelief and sadness of how bad whatever we just saw was. Not even John Williams could save this movie\\, and that is saying something. The only good thing to come out of this movie is that now it is clear as day that anything outside of 1-6 does not in any way shape or form count as Star Wars to any true fan of the films. George is simply a legend\\, and his content is the only material that is Star Wars. Whatever Disney does could not interest me in any way after what I just saw. 20 minutes into the movie I was looking around in disbelief just waiting for whatever I was watching to end. And it seemed like I was in that theatre for 8 hours it was so excruciatingly bad. A horrid mess that ruins everything good about Star Wars in every way. To any fan reading this who has not seen the movie I warn you\\, please\\, do not see this film as it will crush your hope and leave you feeling gut wrenched for all the wrong ways. Truly unbelievable. ","true":true}
