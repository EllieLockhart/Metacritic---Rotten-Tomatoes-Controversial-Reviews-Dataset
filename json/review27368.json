Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Other than flashy big visuals and explosions\\, this new entry into the Star Wars saga falls flat to the point that it seems to have forgotten where it all began. The potential of creating new and interesting characters in an already huge and expansive world was quite literally \\\"burned\\\" away by this film. Words to anyone with extensive knowledge of previous Star Wars universe canon. STAY AWAY","true":true}
