Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The difference between this film and the force awakens\\, both are a great watch but this is truly something different\\, u butt hurt fans who didn't like it cus it took a different direction to the other films can suck my fucking toe","true":true}
