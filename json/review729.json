Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An average random sci fi movie which is full of plot holes and silly humour. That's okay\\, right? Oh wait\\, is a star wars movie? Are you sure? No way. It's a parody movie\\, surely.\\nOh...\\nDon't worry guys\\, they covered up the average turd with Star Wars soundtrack and imagery to fool the mainstream into liking it.\\nHad you removed all Star Wars aspects not only would you never associate it with Star wars\\, it would have been a better film. Instead it just shits all over its decades long fanbase. Because people hated the prequels so why even try?","true":true}
