Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At more than one point in this film I finally understood what it must have been like to watch The Empire Strikes Back in the theatre on opening night. My jaw was on the floor! Definitely worth a second watch (and a third\\, and a fourth...) because it's easy to miss the subtler themes in the face of all that spectacle. The Last Jedi has managed the near impossible - knocked Empire off the top of my personal rankings. It's divisive and I can see why some of the choices made are controversial - but I guarantee that it will be looked on in hindsight as one of the very best of the saga.","true":true}
