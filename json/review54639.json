Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never saw the original trilogy\\, but I've been taken to these new movies by a friend really into the series. I wasn't a fan of the Force Awakens\\, I enjoyed Rogue 1 for some reason. \\n\\n This movie spent too much time trying to subvert expectations that it made it unenjoyable. You have to give us something. Answer something. Not just hand wave away things that a lot of people found important like Snoke and Rey's parents. A lot of the stuff with Finn and Rose could be cut and not change anything. Some of the choices seemed weird like introing a new character then having her suicide herself. That seems like it should have been Leia. \\n\\nI completely understand everything that was going on and the moral they were trying to portray but I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied and a bit depressed. \\n\\nThe visuals were Ok. I like that they used  many practical effects and I oddly like Kylo Ren as a character. He's a shithead but I could see myself watching a movie with him as a Main character instead of Rey. He feels like he has a story worth telling.","true":true}
