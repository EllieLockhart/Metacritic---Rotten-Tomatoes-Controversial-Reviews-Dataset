Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whereas the Prequel Trilogy could have best been described as a good story poorly executed\\, The Last Jedi is best described as a poor story beautifully executed. Johnson has created a very visually stunning yet ultimately unsatisfying film that fails\\, nay actively rejects\\, to take advantage of anything that was set up before it. The central message (What came before doesn't matter\\, throw it away) seems to be more of a commentary on the director's view of the series itself rather than reflecting on anything that actually takes place within the story itself. The abject dismissal of any of the set ups from the previous film feels almost like an attempt at a retcon of The Force Awakens. Which could be forgiven\\, if he replaced those plot hooks and story elements with anything of substance\\, Johnson\\, however offers nothing new to add to the story\\, instead replacing potential backstory with a nihilistic \\\"doesn't matter anyway\\\". Even the plot itself is muddied with the same nihilism\\, the casino planet trip ends with them finding out that their efforts would have no effect\\, not because they failed\\, but in fact in either event\\, and mostly seemed to be there to allow for some mild virtue signaling about cruelty to animals (and let's not even get started on the fact that they freed the animals\\, but left the child slaves to their fate). With such a talented cast they truly deserved better than this script\\, and so did the fans.","true":true}
