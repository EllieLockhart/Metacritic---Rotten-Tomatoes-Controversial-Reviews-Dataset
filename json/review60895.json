We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This story is a masterpiece BUT NOT FOR JOEL AND ELLIE! the bitter truth about reality\\, I get it! But\\, that doesn't mean that the character we LOVE gets this outcome. Give us the chance to decide our fate whether we want to spare or kill Abby! If you really don't want us to kill her then come to a fruitful conclusion. This game didn't hit me in my feels! it made me sad in a bad way! it tormented me how awful the ending was! Ellie got to spare her and also lost two fingers! What do you mean!!! are you telling me she can't even play the song Joel taught her to play \\\"If I ever were to lose you\\\". Even I tried to play the song without two fingers AND IT FREAKING HURTS to know she won't be able to play it properly! And Dina abandons her. We are left with Ellie living the rest of her life ALONE! Without Joel\\, Dina\\, Jesse\\, and most likely Tommy as well!\r\rAgain\\, It hurts me to say the story is a masterpiece but not for the character Joel and Ellie! I'm disappointed with NaughtyDog. Just at least make things good for Ellie. It is a video game\\, so\\, make the players feel positive about the story! Joel and Ellie didn't deserve the outcome! Everything went sad\\, lonely\\, depressing. And it made me even sad in this Covid-19 situation!\r\rI loved the environment\\, went to every place I could go to explore! I wanted the story to never end and to go where it was going! The game is gorgeous no doubt!\r\rBut man\\, This LGBTQ thing that has been going on in video games! Please STOP FORCING us to believe this movement! No doubt it is a good cause but IT DOESNT GO WELL IN STORYTELLING GAMES! What's next now? TLOU: the legacy of George Floid? Don't include these things in video games! These movements are earned through hardship NOT by forcing the players to believe it!\r\rThis LGBT thing wasn't even the concern! Joel and Ellie needed a better ending! THAT'S IT!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
