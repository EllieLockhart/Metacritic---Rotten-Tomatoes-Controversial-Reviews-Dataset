Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie.  The attempt at comedic relief was unwarranted and did not make the plot any easier to swallow.  It actually made me irritated when watching and started looking around the theater in disbelief.  I felt like it was getting overly political\\, undertones that seemed to actually detracted from what little good there was.  Basically just threw away everything SW worked so hard to build\\, simply for what appears to be a money grab by Disney and the expanding SW universe... which now I think will no longer be as interesting.  Hoping JJ can save face on IX... but the damage that was done here on TLJ is just disappointing.  Sobering.  If they wanted to go a different direction\\, they should have just made a totally different movie without using the star wars name.","true":true}
