Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best of the Star Wars films imo\\, as long as you can watch it without nostalgia and hoping it does all the things previous Star Wars films had done (which many of you were crying about after 7). The most complete characters of the franchise\\, the best look at any villain before\\, cinematically clean and exciting\\, it makes sense of 1\\,2\\,3 (which should make it elite on its own) and gives us a great allegory for where we are in the world today. Anybody complaining about it is just sad they weren't chosen to write\/direct it. ","true":true}
