Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's be honest you don't need to be an expert in movies or Star Wars\\, you don't have to the up to speed with all the Star Wars canon (now considered Legends by the new overlords) to understand and realize that this movie failed to deliver the unique Star Wars experience. Rian Johnson and Ms Kennedy used this platform to bolster their own unique political views that Star Wars never needed\\, because it's a general story of good and evil and the hero's journey. \\nUnfortunately\\, there is no way to repair the damage done\\, Rian Johnson bashed our most beloved character Luke and provided a narrative with so many gaping holes and extremes that make no sense (why didn't Holto share her plans with Poe & the gang?!?).\\nI am afraid there is no one in their circles to repair this chapter of the saga\\, not even JJ Abrams\\, who let's be honest is part of the problem. After all the only thing he did was to just re-hash Episode 4\\, and sprinkle new characters that are utterly 2 Dimensional. And Johnson continued this with his re-hashing of elements from Episode 5 & 6. \\nBut the most offensive aspect I take with this movie is the aftermath of it all\\, the people in charge and who delivered this chapter to us (actors included except Hamill)\\, blame it on the fans that we don't understand and have prejudices. Apologies to Kennedy and her gang in LucasFilm\\, but a bad movie is just that a BAD MOVIE. Accept the reality of your failure and try to do better in the future\\, but the problem is they don't want to. Instead they push bad narratives in the movies and considered themselves Oscar worthy\\, when everyone can see they don't have any love for the Original characters.\\nBy now the disaster that is The Last Jedi only shows that wasting characters\\, bad narratives\\, creating a lead-up to moments just to squander them\\, shows that you do not know how to create a movie\\, and this is precisely what they have done here. \\nI just hope this is just a dark phase\\, and better\\, more creative people will be brought in\\, who actually LOVE Star Wars\\, who will know how to create a narrative\\, 3 Dimensional characters and understand the lore and what Star Wars is. \\nOr shift everything and make a KOTOR movie for the new generation\\, ah but wait it was already thrown in the trash by them","true":true}
