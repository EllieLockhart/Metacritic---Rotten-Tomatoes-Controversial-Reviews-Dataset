Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" film Star Wars fans wanted but it has some very rewarding scenes\\, mostly involving Daisy Ridley and the ageless Mark Hamill.","true":true}
