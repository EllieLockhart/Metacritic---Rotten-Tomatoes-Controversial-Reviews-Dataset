Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning: Spolilers in this review. The end of Star Wars.  Horrible space battle plot holes\\,  The First Order  doesn't have bombers?  Doesn't even follow the Force Awakens story lines.  Why did Luke leave a map with R2 if he didn't want to be found? Plot lines wasting time on uninteresting supporting characters.  Now all I am left with are a bunch of new characters I don't care about.  I have been a fan my whole life and looked past much of the prequel flaws\\, still liked those movies.  This one is the end for me\\, nothing to look forward to.","true":true}
