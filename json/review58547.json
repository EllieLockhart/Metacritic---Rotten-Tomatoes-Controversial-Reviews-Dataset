Having to play Abby\\, who shattered Joel's head while Ellie watched\\, filled me with disgust. However\\, when I continued playing two days later\\, I came to the conclusion that Naughty did an amazing job. They had succeeded in me hating a fictional character in a video game! I felt so sorry for the way Joel had to suffer in his final moments that Abby genuinely disgusted me. Naughty Dog chose not to create an average game about revenge\\, but had the guts to make the players think about difficult emotions and urges and the ways people can choose to act when filled with hatred towards another person. This is truly a worthy successor to the first part and I'm really happy for Ellie to have found such deep live with Dina and JJ. I hope there will eventually be a third part\\, because the end of par two left me heartbroken.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
