Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was extremely disappointed with The Force Awakens.  I'd seen it all before.  It wasn't a sequel or even a new movie.  No\\, it was a rewrite of A New Hope.  I was bored.  It was completely predictable.\\nThe Last Jedi changed that.  It was fresh.  It was exciting.  It had twists and turns.  It brought back the humor.  It was a great movie and I'm glad that Rian Johnson didn't write a fan fiction piece\\, which is what The Force Awakens felt like.","true":true}
