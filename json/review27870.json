Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal. Riann Johnson take the usual Star Wars tropes and flips them on their head. I understand the divisive take on this film but really what Johnson is doing\\, is putting out a statement. This is not what you're expecting in a Star Wars film. The series is no longer what you want it to be\\, it is whatever the force wills it to be. As a long standing Star Wars fan\\, I am thrilled with what this movie has done for the Star Wars Universe. An excellent movie through and through.","true":true}
