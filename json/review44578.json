Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage\\, is not and never will be accepted as Star Wars cannon by true fans. If you are a long time fan and want to actually know what happens after return of the Jedi\\, read the extend universe novels. The authors are brilliant\\, respects and builds on the lore in a good way\\, and is just as epic as we expect a Star Wars movie to be. \\nJJ Abrams was smart enough to borrow form the EU in the force awakens. Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren is a abbreviated version of the EUs Jacen Solo\/Darth Cadeus\\, except there's so much more depth and backstory. Something the new movies miss completely. Plus all the story's are Lucas Film approved. #fuckdisneystarwars","true":true}
