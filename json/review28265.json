Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor overall. The parts with the new characters such as Rey\\, Kylo Ren and Snoke were all gripping and exciting. However\\, Rian Johnson has literally shit all over the 'old' characters and destroyed them. For that\\, he cannot be forgiven. Luke's story line goes against absolutely everything the character stood for in the earlier films. And flying Leia was utterly fucking shocking. That alone dropped the rating of this film by AT LEAST half a star. \\n\\nRian Johnson has butchered this series and destroyed certain characters. All I can say is that I am happy J.J. Abrams is back for episode 9.","true":true}
