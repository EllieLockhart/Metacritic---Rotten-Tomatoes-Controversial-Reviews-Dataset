Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An edgy teen trying to be different by shitting on what other people loves. That is Star Wars: The Last Jedi - an exercise of Rian Johnson's ego. He wants to bring the franchise to a new direction. He wants you to kill the past. By hammering home that message\\, he took everything you knew about Star Wars and just shit on it. Now that wouldn't be all that bad if what he's offering is better. However\\, The Last Jedi is prequels level poorly written. The plot moves along with a ridiculous mcguffin. A new tech in the movie that Rian Johnson himself have created. A technology that can track a ship in hyperdrive\\, but was never explained why can't two or more ships track the same ship at the same time. There is a new character who just wouldn't tell her plan to anybody for no reason at all. There is also a mission of kidnapping someone - they are being chased in space\\, low on fuel\\, and these guys' plan is to kidnap someone from a planet. Yup. Prequel level writing.\\n\\nJohnson's another contribution to the saga are: weaponizing hyperdrive\\, and force ghosts can call upon lightning and burn down a tree. Think about what those  could bring in the future.","true":true}
