Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once again\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to bring back everything that made its predecessor worth seeing. It was worth all the hype it deserves which makes it another one of the best of this year and the only movie with such a score automatically makes this one of the best films of this year in my opinion. What makes this film truly deserves the score are the surprises it gives us. Like literally\\, they are completely unexpected and aren't forced onto the film unlike every other film that were released this year I see as a joke. To tell what it attempts to do is completely difficult to say in a couple of words because they keep changing as the film progresses to its end and I got to say\\, it was worth waiting for .","true":true}
