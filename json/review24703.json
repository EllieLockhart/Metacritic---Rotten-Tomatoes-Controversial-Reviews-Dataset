Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was so bad I almost regret being a Star Wars fan. It's good only visually. Half the movie could've been cut without consequences\\, certain characters are killed off for no reason\\, and the movie has so many plot holes and PiS to the point of having no structure.","true":true}
