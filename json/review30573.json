Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up just to leave these comments.  MASSIVE SPOILERS\\, do not read if you haven't seen the movie.\\n\\nWhat a major disappointment.  I was pretty sure a modern director wouldn't know how to handle Luke Skywalker\\, and in that regard\\, I wasn't disappointed.  When he dies for pretty much no good reason\\, I heard a father next to me say to his kid\\, \\\"That was the one thing I really hoped they wouldn't do\\,\\\" and I couldn't agree more. That father had been\\, like me\\, so pumped up for Luke and cheered whenever he appeared.  But this movie gave us little to cheer about.\\n\\nAs someone who saw Ep 4 back in the 70's when I was very little\\, this movie seemed to have a message targeted directly at me and those like me: the only use for older people is for them to die to make way for younger people.  Gee thanks Disney.  Respectfully\\, I disagree.\\n\\nMishandling Skywalker means they're not just telling a new story here\\, they're also destroying a beloved older one.  And what once felt fun with Episode VII's return to roots now feels like really sloppy custodianship of a huge piece of American culture.\\n\\nBut there's more bad here than just mishandling Luke.  There's the attempts to be \\\"surprising\\\" even if it doesn't make for a good story.  People cheered when it seemed Kylo turned to light\\, then were depressed when that wasn't the case.  People cheered when Luke didn't die fighting Kylo\\, then a minute later you could hear the disappointment when Luke just dies for some lame attempt at an artistic statement.\\n\\nThen there's this new character\\, I forget her name\\, that they paired with Finn.  Terrible acting\\, not a likable character at all\\, and her presence kind of make Finn less serious and interesting.   Speaking of Finn\\, we all heard about how Captain Phasma was supposed to be bad ass\\, but she's beyond pathetic in this movie too.  What a waste.\\n\\nThe special effects felt FAR more like the prequels than Ep 4-7\\, so that pissed on what Abrams had just accomplished with TFA.  Settings weren't nearly as interesting as TFA either; for example not one setting to rival Jakku.\\n\\nThere were some good jokes early on that gave way to really bad humor that was completely out of place.  For example\\, BB8 driving at AT-ST and taking out a squad of stormtroopers.\\n\\nI see 93% of critics think they liked this movie; but they also liked the new Ghostbusters\\, and we all know better.  Glad to see a 56% audience score\\, and I really hope Disney gets really disappointing returns.  I heard they liked this director so much they were giving him his own Star Wars spin off universe and his own trilogy.  Wow\\, what clueless idiots.\\n\\nSo you think you're building a whole new generation of fans by pissing on older fans\\, huh Disney?  Well in the words of Luke Skywalker\\, you failed\\, your highness.","true":true}
