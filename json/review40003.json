Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just awful.\\n\\nHow it can score so highly with critics and viewers is beyond me. Almost from start to finish this film abandons both lore and continuity. It's as simple as that.\\n\\nAnd the 'plot'\\, just woefully poor. It was like watching an over extended episode of Power Rangers meets Star Trek. \\n\\nFini.","true":true}
