Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Overall disappinted\\, i'll go into detail bellow:The ending is the most disappointing part of the game which is riddled with disappointments.The graphics are beyond good\\, this is what next gen should look like.The gameplay is nothing special\\, just like the first game\\, you backstab a bunch of people then shoot the few that are left. The story is full of plotholes \\, Joel trusting a group of armed people he just met giving them his name and following them into the basement of a house located near their settlement\\, not only does it contradict the characters personality (the untrusting joel) but even the world building \\, because throughout the game you see that ALL TRESSPASSERS are killed on sight which is logical in an apocalyptic world but Joel saves a tresspasser for no reason gives her his name knowing his head is wanted for the fireflies incident then follows them into a basement x). The ending is way worse  (ENDING SPOILER WARNING)\\, as Ellie decides that her vengeance is worth leaving everything behind and killing abby \\, but then when she finds abby she let's her go (until now I kinda understand) but then she threatens to kill abby's friend unless she fights her to the death and when she wins the deathmatch she decides to just let her go ?!? This sounds like a kid's story but it's the real ending we got. How many times can you change your mind about something so big in 2min \\, she had MONTHS to forget about the vendetta and still decided to leave Tommy her wife AND KID to kill her\\, only to backpedal at the end so you can make another sequel ? And then she understands that vengeance is meaningless ? How do you understand that vengeance is meaningless when you didn't even get your vengeance ?Oh and they also find the time to show you a trans coming out story turn bad because his mom is part of a cult that doesn't accept trans rights. In an apocalyptic world\\, **** trans rights in the zombie apocalypse. And don't get me started on the media treatment of this game\\, having an uncensored sex scene is fine because she's trans but you censure Devil May Cry 5 because it's too explicit ? xD\u2026 Expand","true":true}
