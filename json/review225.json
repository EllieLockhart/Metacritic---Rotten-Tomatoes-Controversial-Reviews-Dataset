It also gets locked on walls which means doing combat near rounded walls means you lose 60-70% of your vision.\r\rweapons hit a lot of invisible walls and make the character recoil for no reason.\r\rAccurate combat inputs at a high level is a nightmare. The game is enjoyable because you have enough health items and things thrown into it that it can be overlooked. However\\, actually examining the controls leads to a lot of problems\\, many of which are brought out in the climax battles. Inability to properly target enemies\\, slow turning\\, auto target targeting nothing\\, the inability to just turn around like a normal human being can\\, weapons not aiming correctly\\, heat action prompts appearing and not working 80% of the time\\, a 3 second delay on  starting most heat actions after a combat command has already been used\\, and so on. It is the same crappy combat from 10 years ago and with so many other games doing combat better the only saving grace of this game is the niche void it fills.\r\rPros:\rSide stories are enjoyable. Very Yakuza-esque.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
