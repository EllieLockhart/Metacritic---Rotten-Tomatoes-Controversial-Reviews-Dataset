Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This felt more like an Episode of Battlestar Galactica than it did a Star Wars movie. There are multiple points in the movie The force is not used in anyway consistent with the way it was used in the previous movies or even the cartoons. As bad as the prequel trilogy was\\, at least the story felt like it was a Star Wars story\\, this movie doesn't feel like it belongs at all.","true":true}
