Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The whole point of the film is that hero worship\\, and holding people to the impossibly high standard set by legends\\, is a fallacy. We see it again and again throughout the film: with Rose starstruck by the \\\"rebel hero\\\" Finn\\, with Luke's legend eating him alive\\, with Kylo vehemently saying \\\"let the past die.\\\" Even with Snoke\\, who we've only ever assumed was an insurmountable evil on par with only the most powerful of Sith Lords\\, who was felled in an instant. No one measures up to who they're supposed to be - and that's the point.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi also tells you that legacy\\, even in a series\u00a0about\u00a0one family's legacy\\, isn't as important as we might have thought. Rey didn't have to have important parents for her to be someone extraordinary - if that's the case. The kid at the end\\, who clearly has some kind of Force abilities\\, just goes to show that these heroes can be\u00a0anywhere. They can be\u00a0anyone. Who's to say that kid couldn't become the next Luke Skywalker?\\n\\nNot only does all this apply to the characters in the story\\, but tonally for Star Wars as a whole right now. The franchise is going to continue to expand\\, creating new heroes\\, new legends\\, new stories - and holding each subsequent movie to the impossible expectations of the original trilogy is only doing ourselves a disservice as fans. \\\"Let the past die: Kill it if you have to\\\" might as well have been Rian Johnson's mission statement with this film.","true":true}
