Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I expected at all! Which is why I give it 4.5 stars. What a fresh take on the Skywalker saga. TFA was a reboot of ANH... and I loved that too but I walked away feeling as though I\u2019ve already experienced that kind of movie. With TLJ\\, I can assure you\\, it\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen. Really looking forward to Episode IX. As you can see\\, the reviews are split\\, the new direction is not for everyone. But personally\\, I loved it!!!","true":true}
