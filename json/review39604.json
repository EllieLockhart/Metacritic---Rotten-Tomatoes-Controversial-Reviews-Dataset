Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this garbage of a film sucks. we waited so long to see the glory of Luke Skywalker and this is what we get? we waited 2 years to understand snoke and he is killed off in such a lame way\\, without explaining anything. 0 Duels in a star wars movie .... Trash just like its director.","true":true}
