Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually\\, the movie is absolutely gorgeous\\, but unfortunately it feels bloated and re-established characters don't act the way they did before. Do not expect any answers to questions you had from The Force Awakens. Don't get me wrong\\, its fun\\, but its so dense with new mythology that it took me a while to really process it. \\n\\nPros: \\n- Great Cinematography \\n- Luke\/Leia \\n- Great fight scenes\\n\\nCons:\\n- No character payoff\\n- Bloated and too dense\\n- Cool concepts wasted\\n- Longest space chase sequence in history","true":true}
