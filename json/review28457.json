Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty disappointed to see all the negative reviews. I certainly see why people would have issues with this movie\\, but Star Wars has never been about crafting a poetically scripted masterpiece. It is about getting lost in a universe far far away\\, and on that note this movie absolutely delivered. If you want to have a great time at the movie theater\\, get a ticket\\, some popcorn and enjoy the next chapter","true":true}
