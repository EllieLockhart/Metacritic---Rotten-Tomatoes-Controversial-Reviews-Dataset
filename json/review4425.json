{"101487":112773,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"CAUTION: SPOILERS BELOW\\n\\n\\nI honestly thought Disney was having an aneurysm while making this movie. As I watched the movie\\, I dreamed that Disney went to Lucas' House\\, grabbed The Last Jedi\\, went to the bathroom\\, and wiped their butt with it. At least the battles were pretty.\\n\\nStar Wars has always had some cringy scripts and terrible battle strategies but there were some seriously stupid moments. Why did Poe send an entire fleet of bombers when you only need one to blow up a dreadnought. In fact\\, why are the First Order spaceships so freaking weak??? I got used to the fact that a small group of rebels can wipe out droves of first order soldiers\\, but come'on\\, really? At least Rogue One had a half decently good battle.The fact that the First Order could shoot a hole into the Rebel cruiser ship and kill the entire rebel commanding staff in one sweep shows how lazy Disney got with the story line. Regardless\\, that was nothing compared to Leia's Mary Poppins moment and that the entire story line is based on whether the rebels are going to run out of gas. THEY COULD HAVE SENT A FREAKING DISTRESS SIGNAL. Idiots.\\n\\nSo many character backgrounds were destroyed or abandoned. Snoke was this mysterious yet powerful entity in the Star Wars universe and they freaking kill him off like a moron. By the way\\, light sabers are very particular towards the side of the force. The crystals in the light sabers are bridged towards the dark side when they start to \\\"bleed\\\"\\, giving them their red color. That being said\\, only the light side of the force can use light sabers that haven't bled and vice versa. Snoke should not have been able to pick up the blue light saber because the individuals leaning towards the dark side can never use their force on even the weakest light sided sabers. Another character they decided to kill off was Luke\\, which I'm sure the entire Star Wars community is rioting about. Pretty disappointing. Freaking ditches humanity like a coward. They could have done an epic show down between Snoke and Luke while trying to save Rey. ANYTHING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. Instead\\, Luke was portrayed as a wimp. Throughout the Star Wars Sega\\, he's had some serious balls. I don't think one stupid kid turning towards the dark side is going to scare Luke. Randomly appearing with a the blue light saber (which was destroyed minutes ago so they could have used the green light saber) and having a little talk with Kylo Ren was a serious waste of time. Like\\, why the hell didn't Kylo Ren keep his soldiers moving forward while he distracted Luke? Whatever.\\n\\nThe entire interracial romance was fine\\, but they could have at least made it a good subplot. As the movie progressed\\, I started to realize the subplot for Finn was useless. He literally made things worse by doing what he did. By the way\\, they showed off his fight against Captain Phasma as a big thing and they threw her underneath the bus like she was nothing. He was a freaking storm trooper and she was supposed to be some badass\\, yet he quickly beats her. Almost as disappointing as Rey becoming a better Jedi than Kylo Ren in the Force Awakens without any training. The latter is almost as disappointing as Rey becoming a full blown jedi in almost 3 lessons in this movie. Luke spent months training and now\\, Luke is like\\, \\\"oh yeah\\, there is nothing to learn here in more than a few days.\\\"\\n\\nSome moments were funny. Some moments were not supposed to be funny but were funny. Some moments were supposed to be funny but were not funny. By the way\\, why are there only so many First Order and Rebel soldiers? Isn't the universe big enough to have billions\\, potentially trillions of living organisms? Yet there are only 400-or-so rebels? Ugh\\, the pains are real.","true":true}
