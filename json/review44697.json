Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tragically bad film\\, so cheesy and poorly written. Rian Johnson doesn't have clue what he's doing\\, they are churning out avengers style crap. I had to actually look away from the screen at times it was so cringe. Do not waste your money.","true":true}
