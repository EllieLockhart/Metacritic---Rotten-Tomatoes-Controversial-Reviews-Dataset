Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi suffered due to lack of direction as well as the mistreatment of some of the classic charctors but besides these flaws I find it to be very visually enjoyable and love Mark Hamil's performance as luke","true":true}
