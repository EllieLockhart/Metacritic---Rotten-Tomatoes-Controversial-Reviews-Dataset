Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sure all the Star Wars nerds love it\\, but it looked like every other Star Wars movie out there to me. As far as quality; it looks good visually\\, acting is well done\\, directing felt a little shaky at times\\, the actors were trying but looked a bit uncertain as to how they should feel. Considering I've seen them act before without an issue\\, I have to assume it's the director at major fault. Story was well put together\\, not everything has a happy ending and I'm glad to see they used that technique in this film.\\n\\nOverall\\, not too bad at all for a series I have little interest in. I vaguely remember seeing some of the others (I fell asleep through one of them)\\, but I may need to watch this new trilogy as this piqued my interest a little.","true":true}
