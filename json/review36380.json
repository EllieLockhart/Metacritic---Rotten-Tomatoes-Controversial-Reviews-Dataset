Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I've thought about TLJ the more I dislike it. Plot holes\\, bad characterization\\, unbelievable motivations\\, corny\/cheesy humor that doesn't fit\\, a theme at odds with virtually every other story of the main saga\\, and worst of all a plot that has our protagonists virtually in the same place as when the movie starts. \\n\\nI mean\\, if you had to come up with one brief phrase to describe where the heroes are at the start\\, and another at the end of the movie it would be the same phrase. \\n\\nThat's pretty crappy story-telling. \\n\\nAll the problems people complain about the prequels are here in spades. \\n\\nIt can be redeemed only if JJ takes this apparently new direction and smashes it to bits in episode ix. Otherwise this movie essentially makes other movies in the saga worse\/less enjoyable by the choices it makes (for me). \\n\\nAs far as enjoyability\\, this one is now currently just above Phantom. \\n\\nMaybe a second viewing will change my mind. I'll find out at noon today.","true":true}
