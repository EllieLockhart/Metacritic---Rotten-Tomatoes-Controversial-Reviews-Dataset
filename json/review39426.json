Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is visually stunning\\, beautifully acted and genuinely entertaining\\, but that is essentially the only redeeming qualities of it. The plot is lazy\\, uninspiring and too convenient at times. Additionally\\, some character motivations are really off-putting which leads to situations that could have been avoided\\, but were not because well\\, there would be no movie. The humor is the typical Disney\/MCU formula\\, which is often forced and takes you out of the moment. Lastly\\, without spoilers\\, there is no cohesion between this film and TFA. Rian Johnson disregards and crudely removes any ties to anything set up in TFA. Last Jedi is an enjoyable enough film\\, but it has major problems that weighs it down\\, thus making it a disappointing addition to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
