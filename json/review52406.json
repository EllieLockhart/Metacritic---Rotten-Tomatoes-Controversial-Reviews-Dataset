Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great installment in the Star Wars franchise. Not sure where all the haters are coming from. It\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to make a crowd pleasing movie\\, while not butchering anyone\u2019s beloved Star Wars baby\\, and at the same time pleasing all the die hard fans that want it to follow the \u201cStar Wars universe\u201d I thought they did a great job.","true":true}
