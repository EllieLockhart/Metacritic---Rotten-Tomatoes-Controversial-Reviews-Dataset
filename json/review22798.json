Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Load of SJW trash. Because people love having that shoved down their throat while watching their favorite franchise.... But\\, I almost want to give it 5 stars. Because this terrible movie just redpilled MILLIONS of people that otherwise havent even cared about politics. But\\, now that the regressives are worming their way into Star Wars\\, Marvel\\, etc\\, and destroying it from the inside like a disease\\, people are waking up and getting pissed off. Disney is the dark side. Disney is the empire. Just a shame that star wars had to be martyred. Its for the greater good though. Pretty sure legions of pissed off fans are going to march to the voter booth and say EFF YOU to the leftside hahaha.","true":true}
