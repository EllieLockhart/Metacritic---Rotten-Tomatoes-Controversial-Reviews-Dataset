Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not NEARLY as bad as everyone makes it out to be! Are there things I wish were a little different? Well sure - like practically any other movie! But overall it was a very good movie\\, and I enjoyed watching it!","true":true}
