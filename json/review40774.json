Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie absolutely drops the ball on all the set ups of Force Awakens. Wastes our time of the past two years of build up since the last film. What a let down of our expectations. How can this episode 8 be so disjointed from episode 7? Do they not have the main story beats mapped out for this trilogy? Kathleen Kennedy is no Kevin Feige. \\n\\nThe writing of TLJ is horrendous. There is no character development whatsoever.  Every main character is basically the same. Plot holes galore. Simple basic human decency of communication could cut out like 30 minutes of pointless subplot that only serves set up Rian Johnson's trilogy that NO ONE WILL WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME WITH (at least half of the fan base). Thanks for watering down the main franchise for greed of more money KATHLEEN KENNEDY!","true":true}
