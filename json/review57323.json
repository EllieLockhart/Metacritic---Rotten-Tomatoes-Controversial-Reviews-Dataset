Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just TERRIBLE forced comedy\\, wrapped in some sort of Fast and Furious esk plot of nonsensical events. For example\\, you thought Leia could only sense things about those she was close to? Nope\\, she's powerful enough in the force that she can survive being in space\\, and then fly back into the ship with the force. How about this\\, you thought it would be fun seeing the new space battles shown in the trailers? Well actually it's just 10 min of the first battle\\, 15 min of the last battle\\, then everything in between is just a ship being just beyond range of another ship\\, and it's VERY SLOWLY running out of fuel\\, so eventually it will get caught. What great action. Also the CGI Looks like it was extra footage from Attack of the Clones\\, despite The Force Awakens having amazing effects. Also\\, there is not a single lightsaber battle\\, not even one. The closest we get is Luke making a fucking intangible clone of himself then making Kylo swing his saber around at what equates to nothing. Also\\, Luke just kinda flops over and dies at the end. I guess from the stress? How lame\\, that's worse than Padm\u00e9.","true":true}
