Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very dissapointing movie. While the visuals are mostly stunning\\, it doesn't stand on it's own and even less as a sequel to The Force Awakens\\, since most plot points or mysteries from that movie were thrown out or not even mentioned. Basically\\, the plot of this movie goes nowhere significant\\, except two very interesting and significant characters dying in a very underwhelming way. Luke's character is very different from what we remember him to be\\, other characters in the movie make nonsensical choices that don't matter in the end and only serve to confuse or make the audience expect something exciting\\, only to flat out be given something utterly mundane. \\n\\nRose as a new addition to the main characters is also meaningless and actually worsens many of the situations. I would argue that Admiral Holdo (the Resistance's one and only pixie commander) is the same way\\, except she actually did something useful in the end\\, even if it ended up not really mattering much either.\\n\\nRey's character development never happens and she's still as strong as ever without training. Humor is thrown in almost every scene that is supposed to be dramatic\\, thus derailing it\\, with the only successful joke being the scene when Luke finally gives one lesson to Rey and messes with her when she literally reaches out to touch the Force. And finally\\, Phasma has even less of a role and impact in this movie than the last\\, making her character's appearance on par with the nonexistant use of the Porgs in this film.\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie made me leave the theater empty and utterly devoid of any excitement for the next or for Star Wars in that matter. I give only 2 stars - for the visuals and that one actually funny scene in the entire movie with Luke and Rey.","true":true}
