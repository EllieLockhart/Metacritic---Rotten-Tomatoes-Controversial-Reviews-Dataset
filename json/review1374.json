Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big fan of Star Wars for over 17 years I wan't to say that it wasn't worth my time. I really wanted to leave\\, but hoped that maybe the ending will resolve all. Just not enough of movie in those plot holes","true":true}
