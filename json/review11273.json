Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, the thing that made this bad movie worse for me was the Rose character.  I was going to give this movie another full star for some decent parts\\, but this character was so irritating that I didn't.  When I think of the Phantom Menace\\, I think mostly about how annoying Jar Jar was and what a bad actor the young Vader was.  In The Last Jedi\\, we are given both of these things with Rose.  She was a totatlly useless character seemingly only there to deliver lines that will make the audience's eyes roll with how tacky they are.  I sincerely hope that she is not in the next movie or I will not buy tix for it.","true":true}
