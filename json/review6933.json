Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Early audience ratings seem a bit harsh to me. Born in the 70's\\, I grew up on Star Wars and was very pleased with this next installment of the saga. Had some slightly goofy humor at odd times and a few questions were either left unanswered or unsatisfactorily answered but overall\\, I'm looking forward to seeing it again! The force is strong with this one.","true":true}
