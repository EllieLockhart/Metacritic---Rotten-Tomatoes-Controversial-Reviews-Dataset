Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a movie critic and you gave this a great rating\\, just give up now. You know nothing of Star Wars\\, plots or good judgement. You and Michael Bay are cut from the same cloth. If you helped make this movie...you're so much worse...","true":true}
