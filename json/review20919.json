Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed. The ideas are muddled\\, the plot is overly convoluted (and full of holes)\\, and the characters appeared to act randomly without much purpose. The Force Awakens was better. ","true":true}
