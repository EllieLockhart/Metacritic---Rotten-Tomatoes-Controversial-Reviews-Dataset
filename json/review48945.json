Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever. Extremely PC and with tons of narrative problems. Producer Kathleen Kennedy & director Rian Johnson have destroyed the franchise forever. Star Wars is DEAD now.","true":true}
