Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Esta pel\u00edcula tiene cosas buenas y cosas malas\\, las malas opacan a las buenas\\, la rebajan a lo peor desde la amenaza fantasma.... una pena.\\nDemasiados buenos momentos se pierden al estar basados\\, en argumentos forzados y sin sentidos del guion.","true":false}
