Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just like how Mark Hamill's character says\\, 'this is not going to go the way you think'\\, is an understatement. This film took a hard u-turn from the Star Wars Skywalker saga. It feels like Disney only cares about keeping secrets and surprising audiences\\, rather than just making a good story. Rian Johnson introduced character 'powers' that we've never seen in ANY of the Star Wars films\\, making it feel like a super hero movie. There were way too many political agendas in this film--the whole point of the film is too 'escape' reality\\, which it did not. I really wanted to like this film\\, but 24 hours after seeing it\\, I can't really think of any good things besides the effects and cinematography.","true":true}
