Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It breaks the mold and redefines what Star Wars is. Has a little pacing issues and some story arcs that don't go annywhere\\, that said there is no bad performance in this movie\\, each and every single actor did an excellent job and the action in this is some of the best on the franchise. \\nThis is a great entry to the saga\\, you can really hear Rian Johnson's voice in the whole movie\\, and he takes the saga in a whole new direction and establishing the new cast at the center of this trilogy.","true":true}
