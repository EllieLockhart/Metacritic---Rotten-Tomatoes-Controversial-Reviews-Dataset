Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars ever. If your an 8 year old or if you've never read any star wars lore or seen any of the other movies maybe you will like this childish mess but if not you will hate it. They've officially killed the entire franchise and I will never pay to see any more of these \\\"films\\\" ever again. But if you wanna see angry jedi and whiny sith with no character development with hollow boring characters and no direction in there story this is for you. Nothing about this made sense and any involved should be ashamed and never work again. Hell i even liked the second trilogy that everyone hated. Wish I could give this a worse score than zero stars. Don't waste your time they just KILLED STAR WAS.","true":true}
