Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"clearly the writing team between this new trilogy was entirely disjointed and went into this without a good plan\\, aside from basic plot it barely seemed like a follow up to TFA. Characters entirely mistreated and basically an entire waste of time with several pointless subplots.","true":true}
