Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about the movie was the cinematography and visuals. \\n\\nThe plot made no sense\\, the character development from the previous movie got thrown out the window and the character development in this movie was a bit too forced (no pun intended)\\n\\nI didn't even know Finn and rose had \\\"chemistry\\\" or a \\\"romance\\\" until she kissed him at the end of the movie. \\n\\nA big swing and an unfortunate miss from Disney on this one.
