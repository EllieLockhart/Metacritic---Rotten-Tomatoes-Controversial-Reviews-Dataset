Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is bad. To give you an idea i bought a ticket for the greatest showman playing around the same time and snuck into star wars cause mt young son wanted to see the movie and I couldn't stomach financially contributing to this mess of a picture. I hope jj can right this ship","true":true}
