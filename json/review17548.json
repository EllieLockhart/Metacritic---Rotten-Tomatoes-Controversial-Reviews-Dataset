Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up to call out RT's fixed score for Last Jedi!\\nWe already know the critics 90% score was bought. \\nBut now they want us to believe the public gave this pile of poo-doo 49%!\\nIf the last 50 pages RT allows us to view is anything to go by\\, 49% is mathematically impossible! 10% is more like it!","true":true}
