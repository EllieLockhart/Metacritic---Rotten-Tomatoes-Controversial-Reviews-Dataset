Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All development by J. J. was stomped on by Rian Johnson\\, Characters were completely out of character and only developed in a negative way. The burning of the books is NOT the jedi way\\, let alone something Yoda would do. This film is a mockery of the franchise.","true":true}
