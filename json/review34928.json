Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film isn't perfect. There's a few contradictory elements and several key plot points that might frustrate fans\\, but the movie's so good in parts that I can't help but ignore its flaws. It has maybe the three best scenes in all Star Wars\\, from the [spoilers] lightspeed ram to the throne room battle to Luke walking out of the bunker at the end. Add to that well-explored themes of heroism\\, belief\\, failure\\, perseverance\\, and our relationship with past. It has satisfying character arcs\\, spectacular action\\, genuine surprises\\, and a real understanding of what makes a movie good generally and what makes the Star Wars saga so iconic.","true":true}
