Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to process it for a bit after I saw the movie but overall I think it's an amazing film. As a long-time Star Wars fan (I first saw Star Wars in 1977 when I was 2)\\, I really appreciated what they did with The Last Jedi. Although I didn't agree with everything\\, I really liked how the movie keeps throwing twists and turns at you. You have to expect the unexpected. It keeps you on your toes and goes against almost every convention we're used to. It was a fresh take on Star Wars that also included some social commentary as well. It's still the classic battle of good vs. evil but it puts a more complex spin on it. Also\\, it has everyone talking. There's a lot to say about the movie after the fact\\, which I think indicates how good of a move this is. No\\, it's not perfect but it was definitely an enjoyable ride.","true":true}
