Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie at a midnight screening and everyone was excited. The whole theatre had an electric vibe. That soon changed. The movie for one is entirely too long\\, you could shave a whole 45 minutes off this movie and nothing would change. The entirety of the resistance plot is pointless. Then we get to the bad parts. SPOILERS:\\n\\nSnoke dying was the first moment the audience started getting annoyed. This was a huge waste. The character had so much it could do. But nope. Nextly\\, Luke's death actually made my entire audience (myself included) were all booing. The story of Star Wars is the story of Luke Skywalker. There were plenty of other problems\\, the fights were eh at best\\, the new characters were boring\\, and the entire movie just felt too long. I have no excitement for episode 9.","true":true}
