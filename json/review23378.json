Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! The Last Jedi made me fall in love with everything great about Star Wars all over again: the theme of hope\\, of learning what it means to be a hero\\, of the costs of victory. Star Wars films have always been spectacular\\, but the best films were the ones where the action and plot was driven by the characters and had genuine emotional impact. And yes\\, Star Wars - the first film will always just be Star Wars to me - was a pretty dumb and goofy film at times\\, too :)\\nThe Last Jedi is not a perfect film by any means\\, but it's breathlessly daring and refreshingly bold in the questions it asks you as a viewer and as a fan. The Last Jedi has given me hope for the franchise.","true":true}
