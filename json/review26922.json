Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"one of the best ones buy far\\, yes they are removing the old characters\\, but I think this is needed\\, Starwars can not cling to the old ones anymore\\, so this is buy far the best way to go\\, yes there might have been some characters in this movie that maby should have gotten some more love but\\, most of it was good.","true":true}
