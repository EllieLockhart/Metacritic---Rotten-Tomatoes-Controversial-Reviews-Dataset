Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes the Star Wars mythology in a new direction and has the flawed characters that make a saga truly compelling.  Everyone wants their favorite characters to be pure and good\\, but in fact most of the Star Wars Characters have significant flaws and moments of weakness that have led to major events in the story.  \\nObi-Wan \\\"failed\\\" at training Anakin and went into exile.  Later\\, he gave his life to become a more powerful \\\"Force ghost\\\" and advise Luke.\\nLuke was too old to begin his lifetime training as a Jedi and as such didn't have the same foundation as other jedis.  This makes him susceptible to mistakes\\, and more compelling and relateable.  The movie is shot well\\, and the characters are beginning to flesh out well.\\nStill a little kitschy in certain parts that are obvious references to modern politics and society.  Shot well.","true":true}
