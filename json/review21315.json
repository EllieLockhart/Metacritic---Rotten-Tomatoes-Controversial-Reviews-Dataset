Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to a premier of this hot garbage\\, and most of the audience was silent for the best part of the movie. Apart from a few chuckles\\, there was no emotion outburst from the audience. Not something I would expect from people who like Star Wars. And after the film ended\\, there was no cheering\\, no nothing. I could feel the disappointment in the air\\, as the viewers were leaving the cinema. And exactly that sums up this movie. It is just some random guys' (the director R.J. and the screenwriters) attempt to create something different with SW universe\\, but failing miserably. It was so boring\\, the characters we loved (from the original trilogy) were torn down to fillers\\, and the new characters (from TFA) went nowhere. To be honest\\, every story in this film felt unimportant\\, as did most of the characters. To express my feelings about this movie in Master Yoda's words: \\\"An utter disappointment this movie is.\\\"","true":true}
