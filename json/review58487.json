Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A movie that outright disregards and lacks utter respect for the movies preceding it. Rian Johnson said it is difficult to direct a middle movie for a trilogy. What he doesn't say is that this movie is ridden with huge plothole\\, slapstick comedy and romance\\, no character arc payoff. I mean what the fuck. If you could destroy a destroyer fleet\/ship by jumping in hyperspace through it\\, why not destroy death star and Starkiller Base like this? Leia pulls off what could only be a deus ex machina. Luke\\, Kylo and Rey can apparently use Skype through the force.That awkward romance b\/w rose and Finn and that kiss seems so forced and out of place. Just plz don't allow him to direct another spinoff trilogy.","true":true}
