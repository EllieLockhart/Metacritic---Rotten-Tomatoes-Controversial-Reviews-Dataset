Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's clear these filmmakers don't know what to do with their characters or universe to make a compelling story besides just killing someone off. boooooooring. walking dead is weak for the same reason. don't know how to keep the audience's interest? kill someone off. this time\\, unfortunately\\, they killed their own story. bye bye star wars\\, i had hoped you could do better than lucas' shitty prequels\\, but you can't. for some reason\\, only the tv shows seem to get what we want to see. weird.","true":true}
