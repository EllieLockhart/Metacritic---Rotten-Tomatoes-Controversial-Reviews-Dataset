Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Addressing the people who are complaining about several aspects of the film i would just like to explain things to you very slowly.\\n\\nFirstly i have seen a lot of people complaining about Princess Leia's use of the force. We have always known that Princes Leia is force sensetive\\, but opted out of training to be a Jedi to focus on the political needs of the galaxy\\, so the fact she is able to use the force when she needs it most\\, should not be a surprise\\, considering she is as equally gifted as Luke. there are also examples of jedi using the force to survive and move around in space for short amounts of time in the clone wars TV show.\\n\\nSecondly addressing the \\\"death\\\" of Luke Skywalker luke did not die\\, but followed in the footsteps of his former masters by becoming one with the force so that he can better guide Rey in the future.","true":true}
