Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't love EP7\\, but I eventually appreciated it for what it was.  I knew going in that Luke was going to be not what I expected. . .but come on!  Rey's story arc is now completely uninteresting to me.  Was the whole point of this trilogy to destroy the Skywalker story?  There were some great moments but overall I do not like where they took the Skywalker family.","true":true}
