Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lack of character depth and fragmented story left this movie short on its ability to make any meaningful connection.  It wasn't good story telling.  A specific example would be scenes where it was funny where it shouldn't have been and others that were supposed to be funny but weren't.  For example\\, Princess Leia doing a superwoman flight while in the vacuum of space and never having done anything with force abilities in the past or Poe's dumb phone call bit. The former was funny and wasn't meant to be\\, the latter trying to be funny but wasn't.  There are just too many issues with this movie to list here and I was initially excited about the \\\"Jedi must end\\\" trailer.  Thought it was taking us on a different tact.  As such\\, it didn't and really just eliminated any need for Episode 9.","true":true}
