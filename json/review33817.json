Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie with a silly plot\\,story\\, and subtext. All the beloved character were pretty much demeaned so to be replaced with less interesting ones that have no quality story arc. The main character deals with very little flaws and goes  through almost no growth that is meaningful. The movie also does everything it could to undermine and belittle the loyal fans and fan theorists who love to give meaning and purpose to the fantasized world and its characters. Much of this movie seems to be based on some sort of social\/political agenda that leaves the story at the way side. Sad day for art culture. Don't bother\\, just an unintelligent attempt at a money grab","true":true}
