Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked in somewhat apprehensive.  The Force Awakens was decent\\, particularly when compared to the Jar Jar laced prequels\\, but I was disappointed with it's lack of originality (it was clearly a remake\/reboot of the original Star Wars movie).  Rogue 1 on the other hand was a well done heist movie that tied in nicely to the New Hope.  I was worried that The Last Jedi would try the same approach as the Force Awakens\\, and mimic Empire.  In the 37 years since Empire was releases\\, countless original books and comic book story lines\\, you would think there would be some kind of original content to draw from.  I walked out somewhat puzzled\\, there were some funny moments\\, some well constructed sequences\\, but the story?","true":true}
