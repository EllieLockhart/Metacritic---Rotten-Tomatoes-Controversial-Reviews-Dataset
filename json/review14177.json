Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave a 2.5\/5 \\n\\nCause I like it better then SW7. \\nI will say it truely. Rogue One was the best of the 3 so far!\\nI like the serious tone of Rogue One. I really feel like SW now are made for toys selling and mostly kid. No story needed. \\n\\nWhy BB8 was created with a place to put money in him? \\nAnswer: only to sell some bank for kid...\\n\\n*****SPOILER******\\n\\n\\nWhy snoke story is dead.. well they dont want to put effort on it. Luke trolling Ray but not wanted to train her... I was not asking for something in particular with Luke\\, seriously!! But training Ray well\\, I think everyone was waiting after that..  it was like watching a big brother pushing is little sister. A chase that was just plainly stupid for the entire movie...chasing each other at 5miles per hour....\\n\\nBut at least it was not a copy paste of an old one!! The quality for space ship and explosion was there!","true":true}
