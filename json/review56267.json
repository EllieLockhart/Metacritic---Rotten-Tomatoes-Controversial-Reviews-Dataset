Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi might be visually stunning and the return of Luke Skywalker was exciting\\, the movie unfortunately isn't very good in terms of character development or the plot. The Canto Bight sequence was a wasted opportunity and the slow chase was tense at times but was also boring. The character of Luke Skywalekr has also become an almost unlikable character in terms of how much he changed. Luke used to be the hopeful\\, inspiring and positive farm boy turned Jedi-Knight but is now the lightsaber throwing\\, grumpy and at times bad Jedi. The many questions the fans had for The Force awakens were given very underwhelming and bad answers such as Rey's parents being no-one. The extent of Rey's Mary-Sue like abilities has been further amplified in this film making the character quite unlikable. Overall\\, the film looked amazing but the story was just bad. Rian Johnson has let down the Star Wars fandom.","true":true}
