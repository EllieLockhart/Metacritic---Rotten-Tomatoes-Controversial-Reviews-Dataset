Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was never interested in making my opinion on movies public with reviews or voting or whatever stuff\\, but after watching The Last Jedi and as a huge Star Wars Fan who grew up with the original trilogy\\, waiting years for Episode 7 and then again for Episode 8 with all the speculation and expectations going on\\, I have to say I was so disappointed with some parts and twists of the movie.\\n\\nI know that the Last Jedi is not a movie for fans only and I really appreciate some of the scenes like bringing Yoda back\\, but still as a star wars fan the last Jedi built up expectations\\, that could have easily been fulfilled and still push the new characters up in front\\, but it didn't happen. Instead\\, the movie was packed with uninteresting plot fillers like the Cant-Bight scene. And yes\\, it is not an movie for adults only but that really unnecessary slapstick humor during some of the most meaningful scenes not only interrupted\\,  but totally destroyed them. Just remember the  Lea and Luke scene....\\nAgain\\, if you look at the movie not as a Star Wars fan\\, it might deliver most of the time\\, but as a true Fan\\, I was really disappointed.","true":true}
