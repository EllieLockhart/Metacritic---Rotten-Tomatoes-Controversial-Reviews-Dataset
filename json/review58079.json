Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"20+ year SW fan and I've never written a movie review but I feel compelled to do so.... This is an AWFUL addition to the SW canon and a disrespectful slap in the face to lifelong SW fans everywhere...I feel like a piece of my heart has been stolen","true":true}
