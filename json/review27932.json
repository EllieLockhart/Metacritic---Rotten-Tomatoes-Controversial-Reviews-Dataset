Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please ignore everybody giving this film one half of a star. That's just silly. This is a well made movie with its problems\\, but the postives outweigh the negatives. It's funny how people are criticizing the movie because their Snoke theory was wrong or that they didn't get much Luke\\, judging the movie on not getting what they wanted\\, and not how good the movie is.","true":true}
