Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing to say the least. I had high hopes but the plot didn\u0092t really make sense. The way they treated Luke\u0092s character was poor. I don\u0092t mean how they killed him off. The whole drinking milk and casually tossing the lightsaber away. All of that could have been done infinitely better. Rey had effectively zero training beyond getting her Fitbit steps up following him around. So much more could have been done to build her character while helping Luke gain redemption. \\n\\nPo and has call holding skit was just cringe worthy. He is going head to head with a man we are led to believe is effectively second in command and he was reduced to a laughing stock with zero authority. \\n\\nFinn - what was that all about?? A whinge about capitolism\\nAnd then fly back not to save the day?\\n\\nPhasma? Kill off what is an iconic looking character in one fight?? \\n\\nSome excellent suggestions of minor plot tweaks are out there which would have vastly improved the story. \\n\\nThey seemed to want to jam so much In that the story for me lacked cohesion and didn\u0092t really know what it wanted to be. It killed off anyone interesting. Turned leia in to some space walking wizzard. Left me feeling greatly short changed. Visually it was superb. Music score was again brilliant. But the new vision for the franchise really leaves me scratching my head ... after sadly shaking it.","true":true}
