Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie explains exactly who Rey is. It explains why she has her powers despite having no training. It re-mystifies the Force. It expands on what the Force is\\, and argues Luke and Leia did not obtain their powers by  dumb luck of birth alone. Its thoroughly unpredictable.it has one of the greatest lightsaber fights in the series. I expands on Star Wars mythology and metaphysics of how the Force and the Galaxy far far away operates. \\n\\nWhat it does not do is give all payoffs in one episode. (The consequences of the Casino\\, and the importance the Force placed on meeting new characters\\, as well as the ending will obviously occured in the next film.) Pacing is slow on purpose until the last act\\, which can irritate some viewers. You have to pay attention to what people say quickly\\, as well as the symbolism of how the Force is manifesting through characters like avatars\\, especially as to why this is happening at the First Jedi Temple.","true":true}
