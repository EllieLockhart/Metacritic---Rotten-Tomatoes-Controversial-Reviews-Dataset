Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A thrilling instalment to the Saga! It's a bit too long and has some out of place comedy moments\\, but that doesn't spoil what is an excellent episode\\, filled with new ideas\\, action and surprises. Great stuff.","true":true}
