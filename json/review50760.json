Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beat-for-beat retread of various scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. This isn't a movie - it's a series of remakes and homages\\, all with an ending that could have easily been the ending for the entire trilogy.","true":true}
