Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I never leave reviews for anything\\, but I felt compelled to say something about this game because of the ridiculousness surrounding it.\r\rThis game is good. Like very\\, very good. In MY OPINION and in my experience\\, it absolutely outdoes the first game in virtually every way. It was an extremely emotionally charged experience for me\\, I cried several times and found myself questioning every action I was making these characters take. The way the decided to tell the story is brilliant in my opinion. They make you dislike the new character\\, Abby\\, and her friends by making her do something horrible\\, and then through her section of the story and through her gameplay in the latter half of the game\\, they successfully (to me) humanize everyone on her side of things to the point that it made me genuinely feel terrible and conflicted about everything I had just done as Ellie.\r\rThe overwhelming majority of the criticism leveled at this game is complete nonsense. I am not normally the person to tell a fan base that their outrage is unjustified. I was angry at The Last Jedi. I was angry about Game of Thrones turning into a dumpster fire. This isn't that. The game is fine. If you don't like some of the creative decisions they decided to make\\, that's on you.\r\rJoel being murdered and not a central playable character is not an objectively bad creative decision. It's just that you don't like it. Having to play as the woman that killed him is not an objectively bad creative decision\\, you just don't like it. Ellie deciding not to kill Abby at the end of the game is not an objectively bad creative decision\\, you just don't like it.\r\rI can understand why the game going this direction would possibly make you feel some kind of way. But bombing it with 1's and 0's simply because YOU personally didn't like it is stupid and beyond childish.\r\rAnd as for the extremely toxic \\\"fans\\\" and trolls **** on the game because Dina is Jewish\\, the lesbian romance\\, Abby's physique\\, and the fact that there's a young trans character in the game- you are all very simple\\, pathetic and hate filled people and no one needs to take you seriously.\r\rSo in closing\\, it's okay if you didn't like the game's story. It might not be your cup of tea. But personally\\, as a massive fan of the first game\\, I enjoyed every second of it. I think the new characters are wonderful. I think they made huge improvements in gameplay over the first game. The graphics\\, models\\, facial animations (and animations in general)\\, sound design and music are all simply breathtaking.\r\rIt's a shame that there are some people leaving reviews here giving it a 10\/10 that may not actually feel that way about the game in order to try and push out the review bomb. Personally though I think the 9.5 critic score is completely warranted. I enjoyed it that much.\r\rPeace.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
