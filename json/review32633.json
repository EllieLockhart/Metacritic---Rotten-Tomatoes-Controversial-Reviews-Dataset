Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a very interesting movie for many reasons. Let me get the good things out of the way first: The visuals are stunning and they get better with every Star Wars movie. The credits scene was one of the best scenes in my opinion because it reminded me that the movie was over.\\n\\nThe Bad Things:\\n1.Many\\, MANY plot holes\\n2. It felt very slow\\, monotonous\\, and boring at times\\n3. I'm convinced that Disney paid the critics who gave it top reviews\\n4. The movie was just not good\\n5. As one rotten tomatos user said: \\\"It is essentially a 2 hour chase scene\\\"","true":true}
