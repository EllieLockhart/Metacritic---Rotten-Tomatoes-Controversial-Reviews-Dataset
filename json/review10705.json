Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had the worst villain ever\\, Snoke was so hyped up\\, And he dies after 3 scenes\\, And no I don't hate that the main character is a woman i actually really like rey she's Probably my favorite Character In all of Star wars\\, Kylo has Potential but he shouldn't be the main Villian\\, And luke just disappears\\, and the random comedy was also annoying\\, some one should tell Disney not every movie has to have comedy\\, and I didn't care about any of the characters that died\\, Han solo had a perfect death\\, Killed by a family member\\, Killed in front of loved ones\\, the perfect death\\, Tbh this movie had horrible writing\\, JJ Abrams is coming back but the damage is already done\\,","true":true}
