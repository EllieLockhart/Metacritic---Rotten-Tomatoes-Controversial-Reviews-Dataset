Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not without its flaws. There is some uneven tone in the humor initially and a few awkward scenes. Bolstered by a career defining performance from Mark Hamill. Poignant and emotional scenes of our dear Carrie Fisher. Intense performances by both Adam Driver and Dailey Ridley. A soaring and adorable performance for newcomer Kelly Marie Tran. The movie will take time to saturate and is very different from the comforting nostalgia of The Force Awakens. Some of the most exhilarating\\, high-stakes and edge of your seat thrills. Incredible cinematography and visual depth. I cried\\, I gasped\\, I chuckled and I was totally enthralled\\, if not sometimes uneasy. This is not the warm blanket that was the Force Awakens\\, and as much as I loved the prior\\, this takes risks and opens the door to opportunity. ","true":true}
