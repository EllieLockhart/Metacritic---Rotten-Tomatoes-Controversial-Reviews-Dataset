Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lame from beginning to end\\, too many characters\\, you never get to care for any of them\\, way too many cameos (R2D2\\, Chewacca\\, etc)\\, McGuffins flashed before your eyes that are quickly torn down\\, etc. Additionally\\, the movie reuses and overuses tropes like fliying thru a pit from previous episodes.... a total\\, utter\\, boring mess of a movie. Do not watch\\, you would be wasting your time.","true":true}
