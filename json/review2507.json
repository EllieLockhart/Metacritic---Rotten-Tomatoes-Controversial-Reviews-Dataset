Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A visually stunning film that's sadly let down by a uninspiring script and poor directional choices. In a universe such as Star Wars where the realms of imagination are seemingly limitless\\, I found the movie to anything but. It's extremely narrow in it's approach\\, with a setting that only seems to diminish and constrict the scope and overall potential of the franchise. I felt at times as though I was watching a generic TV sci-fi episode. Admittingly a high-budget one. But I can honestly say I've watched Star Trek episodes that had more thought and care put into them\\, than this entire film. Sure there's massive battles\\, both in space and on land\\, but these fail to conjure up the emotion necessary to really impact the audience. Instead they simply serve as CGI cannon-fodder for the eyes. Contrived plot elements\\, underdeveloped characters and an extremely rushed pacing are the main culprits\\, and something that surely Disney themselves were aware of while in production? Perhaps the result of having to release a new movie each year\\, but who knows? The only saving grace for the movie\\, besides the visual eye-candy\\, which let's face it\\, get's old fast\\, is the performances by both Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, who make a bad movie bearable.","true":true}
