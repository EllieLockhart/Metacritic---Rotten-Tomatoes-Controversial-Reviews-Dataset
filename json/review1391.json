Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a crazy Star Wars fan that has seen the original trilogy over 2000 times I will say that I rank The Last Jedi up there with the original trilogy. This takes Star Wars to a place it has never been and the twists and turns were unpredictable. Can't wait till Episode IX.","true":true}
