Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was predictable and not very engaging. The bad guys were super dumb and the good guys were super humanly lucky. Characters were tossed aside and killed off with semi casually. The story had rehashed elements of Empire and a New Hope with rehashed results. The story developed really slowly and made the first half borderline boring. Major plotlines from #7 were left unresolved. With that said\\, the visuals were stunning\\, they managed to bring elements of cute to the movie without drowning us in it (aka Jar Jar or the Ewoks). This movie missed the mark. It feels like Disney ringing the Star Wars cash register rather than making a movie that connects with fans and moves the overall story along.","true":true}
