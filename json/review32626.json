Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a series of questions without answers aka plot holes.  Unlike others primarily debating the content of the plot (which I do believe was lacking) in general this movie is just an example of a huge budget with poor story telling.  The narrative is completely inconsistent at every level as is the aesthetic and style in which it was filmed.  Rian has taken the momentum that Abraham built\\, fumbled and dropped it in the dirt with hokey tropes taken to an unforgivable\\, saccharine maximum.  There are glaring plot points gone awry and entire subplots that are boring\\, silly and lead to know where.  This whole movie is a giant missed opportunity.","true":true}
