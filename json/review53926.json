Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment! Ridiculous! Here's Why:\\n1. Unnecessarily long movie: first 40 minutes are extremely boring and a meaningless waste of time.\\n2. No justice made to Luke with a ridiculous and incoherent script for a character that was absurdly 100% absent from The Force Awakens.\\n3. Snoke (the most incredible\\, amazing\\, convincing and powerful character \\, btw thumbs up for Andy Serkis\\, the real only actor and hero present in this movie) was easily mauled like a moronic\\, powerless animal during this only amazing appearance.\\nSo\\, yes\\, 2 stars: 1 for Snoke and 1 for Yoda\\, who remains the heart and soul of Star Wars even after being just a ghost\\n... and please remove that irritating disrespect called BB8 and any spherical \\\"robot\\\" like him\\, give me break...is that what the best you can do to replace R2-D2? \\nShame on you Disney!!! I wish George Lucas could come back to the rescue of this franchise\\, 'cause by now it seems it is pretty dead...","true":true}
