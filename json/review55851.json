{"101487":163539,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: Like the \\\"passing the torch\\\" feel. Like old Luke and his story. Kinda loved Laura Dern and a particular badass scene with her in it. Kinda like some of the bait and switch that goes on.\\n\\nCons: Some of the jokes\\, while funny and well delivered\\, seem a little out of place. Some aspects of the story feel like they were thrown in there to either give the actors something to do or to artificially continue this \\\"homage\\\" structure that the new movies have taken. \\n\\nOverall: The story continues in a way I can appreciate. Where The Force Awakens used nostalgia to introduce this franchise\\, The Last Jedi uses it as a means of passing the grander epic onto a new generation. Only time will tell if the new generation is worthy. The movie has problems\\, but nothing that really makes me hate it.\\n\\nGrade: B+ (Maybe my 4th favorite Star Wars movie)","true":true}
