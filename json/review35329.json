Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor was definitely more than the usual Star Wars\\, but the audience I saw it with was eating it up. Mark Hamill really impressed me\\, much more gravitas than I was expecting. I was much more satisfied with how he and Leia were handled in this chapter than how Han was handled in the last one. And it was cool seeing so many women in leadership roles in the Rebellion. I also really liked the new Asian girl\\, she was a really fun addition. Overall\\, I would say my favorite of all the SW films after Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back\\, and I will likely see in theaters again before it goes.","true":true}
