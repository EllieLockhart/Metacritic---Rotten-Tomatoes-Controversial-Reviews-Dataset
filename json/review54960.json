Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a decent movie\\, but felt more like a fan playing with his star wars action figures than an epic space opera. There wasn't the spark that existed in the first 6 movies (yes\\, even the much maligned prequels beat this movie). \\n\\nAnd worst of all\\, they turned jedi grand master Luke Skywalker into a grumpy hermit\\, who would rather watch the galaxy burn than try to save it. Absolutely ruined my favorite film hero\\, and now I can never watch the original trilogy again without remembering what hes supposed to become. He probably wouldve done the galaxy a big favor by just dying on the second death star with the emperor\\, then become the man he did.","true":true}
