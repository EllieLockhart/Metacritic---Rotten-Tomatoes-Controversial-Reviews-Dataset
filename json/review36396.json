Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most boring\\, politicized and disrespectful to the fans\\, the universe and the story \\\"part\\\" of Star Wars.  rian johnson and katlen kennedy - F*CK you! You are two narrow-minded\\, ignorant\\, selfish sick f*cks who don't know a single thing about how Star Wars work and about the rich lore! \\nYou are focused on young fans? Bull sh*t! My daughter who was obsessed by Star Wars -yawned during the movie and asked me: \\\"when will it end?\\\"!!! WTF?!!!\\nEp.7 was good\\, but after this worthless crap you call Ep.8 - for me there are NO Star Wars after Ep.6! It ended there! And you can eat as much of your own shit you call Ep8 or 9 or whatsoever - your galaxy has nothing to do with the \\\"Galaxy Far Far Away\\\". \\nFrom Russia with hate.\\n\\nP.S.: to all the real SW fans - I mourn with you!","true":true}
