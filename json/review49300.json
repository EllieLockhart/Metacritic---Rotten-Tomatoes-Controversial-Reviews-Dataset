Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie so far. Rian Johnson should be banned from ever having anything to do with star wars. Boring story\\, pointless sub plots\\, and humor that seems like it was written by a 4 year old with brain damage. Absolute shit","true":true}
