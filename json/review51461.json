Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Acho  que o filme  que precisa se encontrar e decidir o que ele quer ser um continua\u00e7\u00e3o ou ser independente e deixar de ser 2 horas e meia","true":false}
