Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is good but it's way too overrated. 93% certified fresh is not the score this film should have. The whole thing had no structure and they tried to showcase too many characters. The visuals are great but I felt that they didn't convey anything important. It's okay but I enjoyed the prequels more than this movie. As a film this is better than the \\\"Phantom Menace\\\" but the star wars feeling and adventure is striped away from \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" which is disappointing to say the least. This film is also really long\\, it clocks in at 2 hours and 33 minutes. I do have many positives for this film but If I tell you I would spoil it and people will probably destroy me. Almost every character is great and my favorite is Luke. This film is okay but I would suggest watching Jumanji or Murder on the Orient Express instead.","true":true}
