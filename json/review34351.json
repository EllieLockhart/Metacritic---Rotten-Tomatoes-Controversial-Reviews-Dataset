Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The audience score is rigged ( 1\/2 star votes don't count) and the critics' score is ridiculously high\\, but could Rotten Tomatoes change the \\\"critics consensus\\\" at last? The consensus is hardly accurate by any standards:\\n- \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy\\\"\\nNo\\, no it doesn't. It dishonors everything in the saga we've seen this far and denigrates the characters and the lore.\\n- \\\"while adding some surprising twists\\\"\\nSurprising twists? More like unexpected letdowns and unconvincing turns. \\n- \\\"and delivering all the emotion-rich action\\\" \\nMostly it's boring and the action is mediocre at best. Good-looking though\\, but not very interesting or exciting action.\\n- \\\"fans could hope for.\\\"\\nNo. This is a straight out lie. Fans are shocked and enraged of this filth Rian Johnson has delivered. Beloved characters are disgraced and the whole state of the SW universe is a complete mess now. I've been a Star Wars fan since the early '80s\\, and it's painful to see the most greatest scifi-universe to end like this. Change the consensus RT\\, that's the least you can do.","true":true}
