Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a reason critics gave this movie such high scores...it is a really good movie! Audience scores are low because of their inability to let go of what they believe SHOULD happen. More than any other film series\\, there is such a sense of ownership from fans. They truly feel these movies belong to them and they should go exactly how they want. Egos need to be dropped and this movie needs to be enjoyed. I did need to see this movie more than once\\, as there was a lot to take in and process. Once I did that\\, I saw how good it truly is. Action\\, emotion\\, struggle\\, new worlds\\, new characters\\, surprises\\, twists\\, turns\\, etc\\, etc etc. For Star Wars to continue\\, some things have to change. And fans need to accept that. Let go of the past and expectations of what SHOULD be..Watch this movie and future Star Wars movies with an open mind.","true":true}
