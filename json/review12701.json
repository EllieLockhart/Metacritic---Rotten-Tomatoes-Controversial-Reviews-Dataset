Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't shake the fact that this installments major plot line was escaping with minor side arcs that disappointed in their delivery. This really made the title 'The Last Jedi' seem more of click bait than content. It would have been nice if the relationships between characters were more meaningfully developed\\, with in-film timelines that made sense. Seemed a bit slapstick with characters jumping between these subplots. Lastly\\, I was sad to see how the movie made use and sent off the franchises most iconic character -- it should really have been done better.","true":true}
