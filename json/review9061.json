Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of bizarre choices\\, this is easily the worst of the Disney Star Wars movies - despite having overall more substance than The Force Awakens. The trend to undercut dramatic moments with humor is worrying\\, as is the inability of blockbuster movies to tell an effective story in under 2 hours.","true":true}
