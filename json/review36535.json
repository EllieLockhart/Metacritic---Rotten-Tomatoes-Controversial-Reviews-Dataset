Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie feels like two movies bolted together. They have included classic scenes that feel like they were lazily copied and sandwiched those between scenes full of slapstick humour. The tonal shifts are jarring. The story creates lots of questions but doesn't answer any and in fact If you expected a follow up to The Force Awakens with answers and plot development then you will be disappointed. This entire movie is filler and actually ruins all of the plot development in The Force Awakens so nothing really  happens or goes anywhere after two movies.","true":true}
