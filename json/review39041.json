Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things in this movie I liked:\\n- Snoke's guards\\n- Old puppet Yoda\\n- Rey saving the ancient Jedi books\\n- Mark Hamill's performance\\n- The \\\"spaceship splitting another spaceship in half\\\" scene\\n- Set design of the old Rebel Alliance base\\n- R2-D2\\n\\nEverything else is terrible. To the point where I'd be here all day trying to explain what I think is wrong with this movie.","true":true}
