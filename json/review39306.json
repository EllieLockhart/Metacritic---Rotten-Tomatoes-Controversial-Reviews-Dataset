Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film is a good actionmovie\\, BUT not a good StarWars Movie its totaly shitting on the StarWars Franchise and History and i hope Rian Johnson never touches a SW movie again. and i hate to have gender or racism debate in a fucking actionmovie i dont wanna watch that at saturdaynight cinema fack off disney !","true":true}
