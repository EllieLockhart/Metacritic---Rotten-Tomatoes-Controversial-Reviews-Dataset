Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined the adventure and image of Luke Skywalker.  There should have been a much better transition such as training together\\, mentor ship\\, fighting evil together\\, Skywalker blood line revelation\\, hero\u0092s death\\, and passing of torch.  Also\\, the new characters are weak and unappealing\\, no real emotional connection.  Unnatural and forced humor. They should shred this movie and redo it.  Quit trying to make political points.  This caused them to ruin one of the best stories and adventures of all time.","true":true}
