Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am glad I skipped watching this in theaters. I rented it and I was completely disappointed in how they ruined Luke Skywalker's character. Plot holes throughout\\, nonsensical story telling. Many times throughout the film I felt that it was pandering to make a political statement than focusing on the creating a good film.\\n\\nAs someone who love the original Episodes 4-6. Was disappointed in episodes 1-3. Now I lost complete faith in this 7-9 series. Disney and the people they hired destroyed this franchise. Do not bother watching this movie.","true":true}
