{"101487":99873,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After reading all of the negative viewer complaints\\, I had determined that it might be better to wait and catch this movie on DVD or digital download. Curiosity got the better of me though\\, and when the opportunity arose\\, I headed out to the theatre to view The Last Jedi. However\\, I had read the plot synopsis and a hundred or so viewer reviews\\, both good and bad\\, so I went into the showing with no preconceptions or high expectations as to what this movie should or should not be.\\n\\nI must say that I was pleasantly surprised. While The Last Jedi was no Empire Strikes Back\\, it certainly does not deserve to be ranked as low as the Prequel movies. I would say that it is at least as good as The Force Awakens\\, but is a bit more original than that movie. And while Rian Johnson did stretch the boundries of the Star Wars universe\\, I don't think he went so far as to break any basic laws of SW Physics. To those who give this movie low scores and say it is not a true Star Wars movie\\, i'll say that you are not true fans.\\n\\nNow that the movie has been out for ten days\\, it would be pointless for me to put a review here that rehashes the plot. What I will do instead is give my take on some of the \\\"controversial\\\" points that have been brought up by other fans who lack any insight into what has happened in other installments of the franchise.\\n\\n- Complaint: The humor was juvenille and off the mark.\\n\\n- Somewhat Agree. Star Wars has always had a bit of humor to take the edge off of the seriousness - Leia cracking a joke about Vader's leash\\, Han's constant wisecracking\\, Vader making a choke pun or teasing about the Emperor's forgiveness\\, the implication that Obi-Wan might have a drinking problem. But any comic will tell you that timing is everything\\, and the OT and the PT seemed to have it down. While appreciated to break the bleak atmosphere of hopelessness in which The Last Jedi was set\\, the comedic timing was definitely off\\, and some of the jokes were over the top. We get it - life\\, even in times of war\\, is not 100% balls-to-the-wall seriousness. But The Last Jedi had just a bit more humor than what I think should be there.\\n\\n- Complaint: Poe Dameron was a complete dick.\\n\\n- Strongly Agree. For me\\, it started downhill with the Poe character about 90 seconds into the movie\\, when he \\\"tooled\\\" General Hux by making a \\\"your mother\\\" joke while attacking a First Order Dreadnaught (again bad comedic timing). And honestly\\, by five minutes into the movie\\, he should have been in the brig for the rest of the movie\\, as his actions caused a lot of deaths and destruction among Resistance Forces. Oh\\, and there is also that business about insubordination and outright mutiny. But\\, by the end of the movie\\, Leia pretty much handed Poe leadership of the Rebellion\\, which is a necessity since everyone else is dead\\, and of course we know that Leia will either will have to be implied offscreen or written out before Episode IX. In light of these events\\, I hope that  J.J. will write in some \\\"growing up\\\" into Poe for the next movie.\\n\\n- Complaint: Tracking ships through Hyperspace is old news.\\n\\n- Agree. Apparently\\, Rian Johnson did not research this plot point. The earliest ship tracking in the SW-verse happens in Attack of the Clones when Obi-Wan Kenobi put a tracking device on Jango Fetts ship and follwed him to a Separatist hideout. Darth Vader tracked the Falcon to Yavin 4 - it was Leia\\, who seemed incredulous about in this movie\\, who told Han about all those years ago.\\n\\nAs an asides\\, why would you need Hyperspace tracking? Your ship transponder beacon would be like a cell phone signal anyway\\, and as soon as it hit on a satellite or ship anywhere in the galaxy you could just jump to that location and harass them some more.\\n\\n- Complaint: Snoke was a waste  of a character and his end was far to swift.\\n\\n- Disagree. While I would love to see a little more backstory\\, the movie was quite effective in establishing his badassedness\\, and the fact that he was arrogant to the point of distraction\\, which ultimately was his undoing. BUT\\, I do not think this will be the last we see of \\\"Snoke\\\". Let me throw a little more fuel on the fire that Snoke was  reincarnation of previous Sith Lords by saying I loved the fact that while Snoke was torturing Rey\\, the Emperor's Theme song was crescendoing in the background. Nice touch.\\n\\n- Complaint: Luke would never have went to kill Ben Solo after sensing the dark side in the boy.\\n\\n- Disagree. Your father was Darth Vader\\, and Emperor Palpatine may as well have been your Creepy Uncle. Together they killed your mother\\, destroyed the Jedi\\, and fried your poor auntie and uncle who raised you\\, not to mention all the other bad shit they did around the galaxy. Just exactly how would you react to sense those exact same capabilities in your student? Would you just take away his lightsaber\\, kick him out of the Academy\\, and tell him to be a good boy? In my opinion\\, Luke's failure was NOT killing Ren then and there.\\n\\n- Complaint: Leia's Superman moment was \\\"Marvelish\\\" and out of character.\\n\\n- Disagree. I thought this moment was well done and did not at all look out of place or \\\"take me out of the movie\\\". Leia was strong with the Force. The Force connects and binds things\\, as we are told. Being blown into space is not an immediate death\\, and for someone strong with the Force\\, it would not at all be a stretch to pull themselves back to the ship. Now in open space with nowhere to go\\, it would be a different story\\, and if they ever decide to have Jedi flying from planet to planet using the Force alone\\, that would be definite overkill.\\n\\n- Complaint: Jedi connections\\, between Rey and Kylo\\, over vast distances should not happen.\\n\\n- Disagree. This has totally happened before in Star Wars cannon. The Emperor sensed that Vader was in trouble on Mustafar and set out to rescue  him. Ben sensed the explosion of Alderaan. In a ROTJ cut scene\\, Vader tried to entice Luke\\, who was on Tattooine\\, while Vader was near Endor. And it has been implied that Yoda and Ben Kenobi could communicate from Tattooine to Dagogah\\, but did so very seldom for fear that The Emperor could sense it.\\n\\n- Complaint: Yoda showing up \\\"in the flesh\\\" could not happen.\\n\\n- Disagree. In the recent book that has tales from different characters around the time of a New Hope\\, Qui-Gon Jinn appears to Ben Kenobi. Kenobi remarks at how \\\"real\\\" Qui-Gon is\\, to which he tells Ben that he can be as real as he is needed to be. Apparently\\, Jedi who have studied the Living Force can not only become concious Force entities\\, but they can also cross back over in to the temporal realm if need be. It does bring hope that we might see Luke again\\, and maybe even old Obi-Wan could make an appearance.\\n\\nBTW\\, I thought the Yoda puppet was very well done\\, much more faithful to the original than the abomination that was used in The Phantom Menace.\\n\\n- Complaint: The Rose\/Finn\/DJ story arc was wasted time and  an unnecessary contribution to the movie.\\n\\n- Agree: After making Finn a hero\\, you paint him as a deserter\\, team him with a disposable sidekick\\, make an unnecessary trip to Las Vegas\\, and then team them up with another useless character\\, simply to get Finn back into a position to fight Phasma. This entire story arc made the movie drag in the middle\\, and in the end\\, accomplished NOTHING - Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo ended up doing the job for them.\\n\\nI'll also add here that Phasma should not have been brought back for such a small role. I understand that she is the NT's equivalent of Boba Fett\\, but she really did nothing to enhance the story\\, other than to become one of the most unlucky - or inept - characters in the entire Star Wars universe.\\n\\n- Complaint: Luke Skywalker's character was completely disrespected.\\n\\n- Strongly Disagree. One of my favorite movies from yesteryear was \\\"The Sting\\\". Paul Newman played a washed up con-man who is recruited to take down a big time Mafioso for revenge. When approached about the job\\, even though he was once the best at the art of the Con\\, he refuses to go along with the plan\\, preferring the bottle and cheap grifts and telling his future protege that he's got the wrong man.\\n\\nI loved Rian Johnsons take on Luke Skywalker. This Luke wasn't the wide-eyed farm boy\\, or the fully-realized Jedi standing proud before the Emperor. This Luke was one that had seen and done it all. This Luke realized too late that even though he was a Jedi Master\\, that did not make him a good Jedi Teacher. This Luke\\, scarred by his failure\\,  basically told his protege \\\"you've got the wrong guy\\\". And add to that\\, he knew the history of the Jedi\\, about how they failed because of their own arrogance\\, and because of it he believed that the galaxy was better off without them.\\n\\nI don't exactly agree with Luke's passing. I think that the conflict should have been in the flesh\\, with a Kenobi-like result. But\\, it was a powerful\\, full circle ending for the old Master. Unlike Han's death\\, which was put in to accomodate the actor's desires\\, I wont watch the OT movies now and have instant regret when I see Luke in them because I know that his future end will be in keeping with the values of the Jedi Knights.\\n\\nWhat else worked for me in this movie:\\n\\n- The scene in which Snoke chides Kylo Ren as a \\\"boy in a mask\\\" and gives him a shocking  lesson in the power of the Dark Side.\\n\\n- Artoo conversing with Luke\\, and his \\\"cheap trick\\\" to try to convince Luke to join the Resistance.\\n\\n- The entire confrontation between Snoke\\, Rey\\, and Ren.\\n\\n- The moment Kylo Ren gave his final entreaty to Rey to join him. In that moment\\, when he said to let all of the old things die\\, I myself was almost convinced that the First Order should win the war.\\n\\n- The score. It was very familiar. There were snippets from The Force Awakens. From A New Hope\\, the \\\"Tie Fighter Attack\\\". From Return of the Jedi\\, \\\"The Emperors Theme\\\". There were even snippets of music from some of the Prequels dribbled in here and there.\\n\\nWhat did not work:\\n\\n- The movie was overly long\\, and dragged in the middle. I do beleive that the Canto Bight sequence was nothing more than eye candy\\, and it could have been dropped with no ill effects. It was simply a setup to place Finn aboard the Supremacy so he could fight Phasma. \\n\\nAs I said in the beginning\\, this movie deserves better than most of the negative press that it is getting. It is well worth going to see at least once\\, maybe twice to take in all the stuff you didnt get the first time around. I would rank it at a tie with the Force Awakens at #4\\, just below Revenge of the Sith\\, but just above Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
