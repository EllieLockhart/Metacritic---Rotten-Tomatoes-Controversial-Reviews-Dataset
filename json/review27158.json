Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I typically like longer movies\\, but this one was pure torture. It was very confusing\\, full of plot holes and continuously jumped between scenes that made no sense. Pure garbage. Don\u2019t even bother to watch on Netflix. ","true":true}
