Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good scenes but overall very very disappointing. Jumped the shark numerous times\\, it was not about sith vs jedi\\, instead we got space battles and shoot 'em ups. Did not delve into the SW universe\\, just a whole bunch of nothing.","true":true}
