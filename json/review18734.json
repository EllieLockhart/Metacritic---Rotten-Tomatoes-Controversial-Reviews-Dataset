Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a flawed masterpiece\\, only for fans who are looking for a living\\, breathing story rather than something solidified decades ago and cast in bronze. The backlash to this movie is just Dylan going electric all over again. Fear of the new. There are definitely annoying flaws with this movie\\, but they can barely detract from the incredible originality\\, passion and style of what Johnson made here.","true":true}
