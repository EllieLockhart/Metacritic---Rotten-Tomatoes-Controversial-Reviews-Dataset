Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. Takes bold chances and succeeds. Doesn\u2019t just feed us regurgitated nostalgia like The Force Awakens did. Has an actual character-driven story and doesn\u2019t give a flip about existing expectations. Excellent film.","true":true}
