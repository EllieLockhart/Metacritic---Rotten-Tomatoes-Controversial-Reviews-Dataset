Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shockingly disjointed narrative mixed with an at times cringe inducing and half-assed script keep any honest viewer from coming away happy. Considering it's pedigree\\, this picture is a bastard compared even to it's two most recent siblings. Fingers crossed JJ and Co. can manage to make a polished\\, coherent\\, and above all professional sequel.","true":true}
