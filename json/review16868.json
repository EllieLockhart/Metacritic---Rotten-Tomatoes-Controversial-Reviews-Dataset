Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In terms of production value and cinematography\\, it's a good film. But\\, for the record\\, if you can't guarantee these\\, you shouldn't be allowed near a Star Wars film.\\n\\nAs far as plot\\, story and character definition\\, it's utter GARBAGE. Plus\\, it completely craps on Luke Skywalker's legacy.\\n\\nOne last point:\\n\\nLuke\\, Han\\, Leia and all the other characters from the OT\\, gave Star Wars it's power. These new characters\\, especially those introduced in The Last Jedi\\, need the Star Wars logo to matter.","true":true}
