Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was the first Star Wars movie that I couldn't get immersed in. Most of the characters acted like children\\, out of character\\, and their actions made little sense. Awkward humor every minute\\, and the whole movie is based around the First Orders elite star destroyers puttering after a single rebel space bus waiting 18 hours for it to run out of gas. And yet Finn and crybaby Rose can take a small ship on a side quest to a planet light years away and come back to the puttering chase. Absolutely ridiculous logical fallacy. I left the theater very frustrated.","true":true}
