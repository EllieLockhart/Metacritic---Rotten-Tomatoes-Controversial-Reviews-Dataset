Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. Don't listen to the trolls. Excellent follow up to the previous movie and transitioning the Star Wars story to a new audience. Proof that you can give is a more original Star Wars story instead of rehashing old stories\\, which seems to be what these trolls prefer. ","true":true}
