Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing in terms of story line and character development. Even musical score disappointing. Not inspiring or thrilling or meaningful enough. Luke was lame-not the same Luke. Cheap effects such as the flying Leia. Snoke was chopped in two like a marshmallow-pointless to the story. Not even curious where the story goes after this. Star Wars-please get another director-this was very disappointing.","true":true}
