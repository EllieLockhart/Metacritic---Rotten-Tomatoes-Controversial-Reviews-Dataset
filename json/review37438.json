Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are cool moments and it's visually stunning so it's worrh to see just for that. But it's a bit over the place seeming to both directly copy and simultaneously subvert the original trilogy. The imitations largely come off as weaker than the originals and the subversions seem clumsy and lacking in substance beyond an attempt to thwart fan theories. It breaks the things that fans hold dear while throwing around fan service at the same time. Most of what the main characters do in the film is essentially pointless and after a series of anti-climaxes (and one or two nice solid climaxes) we're left with rather flimsy and unimposing antagonists.","true":true}
