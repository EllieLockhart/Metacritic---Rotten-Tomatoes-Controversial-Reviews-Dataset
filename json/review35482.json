Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi felt like it was written to make fun of Star Wars fans. It also somehow exists without telling a story or developing any characters. After Luke Skywalker throws his lightsaber over his shoulder\\, if becomes clear the intention of this movie is to throw away and disrespect everything created by previous Star Wars movies.","true":true}
