Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kylo Ren and Rey were the ONLY good parts of this movie\\, not so much their storyline\\, but their performances. Story-wise all of it was terrible. Filled with potholes\\, and nonsensical. Rose shouldn't even be a character\\, much less still surviving by the end of the movie. In fact\\, the whole Rose and Finn storyline was just a huge waste of time and made the film drag on. If they were going to make Finn a useless character\\, they might as well have killed him off with Rose. I loved his character in TFA but they just threw him away in this movie. Also wtf was that scene with Leia? They made Luke seem like a crazy homeless person and ruined his character as well. There is absolutely no clear and present danger\\, the villains seem dumb and lazy\\, just like the writing. This is definitely the worst movie in the franchise.","true":true}
