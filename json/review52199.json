Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching The Last Jedi\\, the next day I found myself waking up to what seemed to be a horrid dream. I cannot believe that this movie exist she and is even considered a Star Wars movie. The amount of confusion\\, disrespect and unnecessary plot holes that are in this disgusting movie\\, baffles me. This story was completely butchered\\, tortured\\, and shamelessly murdered by failure of a director Rian Johnson. This movie is in no way shape or form deserving of being canon to the Star Wars saga. This was an embarassment and a huge disrespect to the original characters and to the entire Star Wars generation. Luke Skywalker wasn't completely pissed on in this film and thrown away as if he was an unimportant side character. The relationships that were formed in this film made little to no sense. Everything that the Force Awakens was building up to was DEMOLISHED by this poor excuse of a director. I do not blame Disney for this abolishment\\, I blame the haneous Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson for committing this crime and I am disgusted that I payed to witness this horrible film. Rian Johnson is like the child that left an immense mess and leaves it for the adults to clean up (aka J.J Abrams). God speed to Abrams who is left with practically nothing to work with because Star Wars is officially deceased.","true":true}
