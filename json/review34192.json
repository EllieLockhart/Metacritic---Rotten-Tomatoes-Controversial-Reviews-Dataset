Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you Rian\\, for making this not a Star Wars movie but a Star Wars movie. Everyone\u2019s mad that they didn\u2019t get the answers they wanted and that it\u2019s not like the past trilogies. That\u2019s what makes it amazing. ITS A NEW STORY\\, HE SAID ITS NOT GONNA GO THE WAY YOU THINK SO STOP BEING BUTTHURT. You have a movie that portrays animal cruelty\\, slavery\\, weapon trafficking among two sides\\, and war\\, still being a Star Wars movie. It\u2019s a masterpiece. I have faith the IX is only gonna make it better. This is just setting up the truth\\, and that is Kill the past. Star Wars is changed forever. It\u2019s literally the opposite of Empire Strikes Back and that\u2019s why I love it. Rian you\u2019re the goat. You saved this franchise and now get to make a new trilogy. Cant wait. 100\/10 for you. ","true":true}
