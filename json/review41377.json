Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a MUST SEE for Star Wars fans\\, while the approach was different\\, Rian Johnson did an amazing job giving sort of a new life to the series. This movie has call backs to the originals and fresh new character arcs and interesting twists for new and old fans alike. Definitely worth a look.","true":true}
