Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*UPDATING MY PREVIOUS REVIEW*\\n\\nDiehard Star Wars fans...watch it twice. We come from a very differentplace than your average fan. We had the entire collection of Burger King glasses. And we played Star Wars on the monkey bars during recess (I was Leia of course). So your first reaction to this movie will probably be like mine: intense and full of disappointment. Trust me when I tell you- go see it again. You will love it the second time around. I sure did.","true":true}
