Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had some good moments but the storyline was all over the place and way too long. There are a number of problems with the movie that don't hold up and now that they've killed Han and \\\"ghosted\\\" Luke I'm unlikely to watch the next one.","true":true}
