Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial reaction to seeing it was \\\"what the heck did I just watch?\\\" I was pretty disappointed. But after thinking about it for a while and realizing that this is a movie FOR KIDS I began to really enjoy the things that happened. It was FUN and hilarious (in a very human way). Try to curb your expectations of what it should be and take it for what it is. It takes star wars to very new and fun places.","true":true}
