{"101487":175603,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\n\\nI love this film\\, and I'm honestly shocked by how much hate it seems to be getting in parts of the fandom. So\\, here\\, after two viewings so far\\, is my attempt at putting down my thoughts:\\n\\nRey: I really enjoy the fact that she starts the film looking for guidance\\, and then tries to find in all different kinds of places\\, hoping to feel that sense of belonging that Maz promised her. And only when Kylo tries to define her place for her does she understand what the cave was trying to show her: she is her own belonging\\, and she doesn't need some kind of special past to define who she is. Her destiny is her own.\\n\\nKylo: I think that Kylo's big tragedy is that everyone\\, including his own parents\\, always saw him as a Skywalker first\\, and as Ben second. And that Skywalker blood was something potentially dangerous that needed to be kept under control. In his eyes his parents weren't giving him the opportunity to become a Jedi\\, they were sending him away\\, because they couldn't cope. The only one who told him his abilities were a gift and made him feel special was Snoke. So of course Ben\\, feeling betrayed by every one else\\, would willingly drink up all of Snokes words. Until Snoke himself turns on him in the beginning of the film. Somewhere between that moment and the moment when he finally kills Snoke\\, Kylo decides the only way to protect himself from future emotional betrayal is to fight and kill everyone else. I don't know whether or not what he says about Rey's parents is true (but I hope it is)\\, but I think he believes it is\\, and he thinks she must obviously feel as betrayed by the world as he does\\, and that it could be the two of them against the world. While he's shouting at her that she's still holding on\\, in truth he is the one who is unable to let go of the perceived pain of his past.\\n\\nFinn: He starts off still mainly thinking of his and Rey's safety\\, and doesn't really see himself as part of the resistance. It's Rose and DJ who show him that just standing on the sidelines is not an option\\, and that the Resistance is bigger than any one person. But also that heroism is pointless if you don't understand that you're not just fighting against something\\, but for something.\\n\\nRose: It may not be much of a character arch\\, since she mainly teaches Finn a lot of important truths\\, but she starts off seeing herself as 'just' a tech person\\, and gets all nervous around supposed heroes\\, but in the end she is one of those heroes herself\\, and realizes they're all just human along the way.\\n\\nLeia \/ Holdo \/ Poe: Again\\, a nice lesson about heroism\\, leadership and the wisdom to see the difference between the two. While Poe obviously is taught his lesson by Holdo\\, and Leia\\, I like to think that\\, in the end \\, Holdo also takes a page out of his book. And\\, seeing that Poe has learned his lesson\\, when he breaks off the attack on the battering ram\\, there's a lovely 'passing the torch' moment between Leia and him. \\n\\nSnoke: He is too sure of himself\\, and too caught up in thinking about legacy and bloodlines. Just the same as everyone else\\, he only sees Kylo as Darth Vaders heir\\, but not as his own person. And\\, even more foolish: Thinking in bloodlines also causes him to completely overlook Rey. Ultimately he is nothing but a relic of the past\\, a wannabe Palpatine\\, caught up in Empire nostalgia. \\n\\nLuke: At last\\, the big one: Luke almost killed his nephew\\, and lost him to Snoke as a consequence of that. In shame he has been hiding on his island ever since\\, wallowing in bitterness. \\n\\nNow a lot of people are complaining that Luke\\, who believed there was still good in Darth Vader and refused to fight him\\, would not even consider doing anything like this. I (obviously) disagree. Luke fought against the Empire\\, lost friends and companions in that fight\\, and witnessed firsthand the destruction the Empire caused. If he saw Ben causing that kind of pain to the galaxy again (a vision which may very well have been boosted by Snoke\\, trying to isolate Ben from his family)\\, I believe he would at least have had that impulse\\, even if it was just for a short moment. To make matters worse he had no idea how to deal with this failure. Ben and Yoda had never talked to him about their failure with Anakin. In fact\\, they had both dealt with it by running away and hiding in exile\\, and later on telling Luke that Vader had killed Anakin. That failure is something that needs to be faced and processed and passed on is a lesson even Master Yoda apparently only learned in the afterlife. And so\\, without realizing it\\, Luke alone on his island has actually become a wiser man than either of his teachers. And when Rey comes along\\, looking for a teacher\\, and he turns her down\\, but also explains to her why he's turning her down\\, he is actually doing exactly the right thing. He's the first one in this Saga to examine why the Jedi failed\\, and why Sidious could rise. By passing this revelation on to Rey he plants the seed of something new. \\n\\nSo his final sacrifice is to keep that new spark alive\\, to give it a chance to grow. If he'd been a hero and had gone to Crait in person he probably would have been dead within minutes\\, gaining absolutely nothing. Instead he did what needed to be done to protect the light. Saving what he loved\\, not fighting what he hated. And in the process maybe even gently pushing Kylo towards redemption.\\n\\nUltimately this is a film about the past and how we deal with it. Snoke tries to recreate the past\\, and fails. Kylo wants to violently tear the past down\\, and it's pretty much destroying him from the inside. Luke\\, Rey and Yoda demonstrate there's another way to deal with the past. Not to demonise it\\, or to idolise it\\, but to face it\\, strip it of the myths and legends\\, and learn from it to build a better future. This also applies to seeing people for who they are and not idolizing or demonising them. Finn isn't the Resistance Hero Rose thinks he is\\, Luke isn't the Legend people make him out to be\\, and Rey isn't the heir to some Force-Messiah. They're all just people\\, and all of them have flaws and make mistakes. Some people are born stronger with the Force than others\\, but in the end it's actions and decisions that define who a person is\\, not heritage or anything else. \\n\\nAll of that is summarized in that final scene. We don't see Rey\\, or Leia or any other \\\"important\\\" characters\\, just that stable boy\\, growing up pretty much like Anakin did on Tattooine. He's another \\\"Rey from nowhere\\\" and he has just as much potential to shape the future of the galaxy as everyone else.","true":true}
