Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute disgrace and disappointing. A disgrace to Star Wars with some interesting ideas but no proper cohesion. Rose is awful\\, the captain is awful\\, Ackbar deserved better\\, the casino plot was a stupid waste of time\\, and the main lead is a Mary Sue.","true":true}
