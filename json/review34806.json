Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Disney shills have been caught! Look at the 4 and 5 star reviewers profile. They are all creating accounts now and giving other movies ratings (mostly disney movies)\\, with no comments so it looks like they are actually real reviews. If you look at their profiles closely\\, you can see that all the other reviews they have done were created within minutes of each other. It shows the time and date right next to the stars. It is completely official now that disney is corrupting these forums with false reviews. This movie was horrible and disney will be lucky to sell half the tickets with episode 9. This was a desecration of everything star wars. Check out Alex B's profile for example (should be close to my review) all movie reviews were done within 1 to 2 minutes of their star wars review.","true":true}
