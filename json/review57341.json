Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so incredibly disappointing that I signed up here to simply release some frustration. I do not post or opine anywhere else on the internet.  Politically\\, I would consider myself a progressive.  It doesn't bother me that we have a woman as the protagonist in this trilogy. it doesn't bother me that Black\\, Hispanic\\, and Asian actors have prominent leading roles either. The world needs to see and be inspired by this diverse cast.  The cast however\\, was wasted and rendered useless by an incredibly terrible movie.  The rest of the forced social narratives in this movie were egotistical and downright insulting to intelligent people everywhere.  The director basically destroyed the other other 7 movies in the saga just to make his points.  Star Wars has always been about EPIC political\\, spiritual\\, and historical themes.  You used to have to look a lot deeper to gain that understanding of those movies. This movie feels like a Social Justice infomercial and destroys plenty of Star Wars lore\\, mythology\\, and characters just to make those points. They should have hired a female director for this movie. She might have saved the Star Wars characters and mythos.  It surely would have come across better than a male director trying so hard to  impress females.","true":true}
