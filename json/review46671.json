Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weak characters\\, bland acting and disjointed story.  Feels like Johnson wants to just start over and kills any kind of continuity.  This film is no 'Empire Strikes Back' - not even close.  Not sure what the critics see in this film but instead of anticipation for the next one\\, its dread that it will only get worse from here for what once was an all time movie franchise.  Nice job Rian Johnson\\, he didn't destroy the deathstar\\, you destroyed Star Wars itself.","true":true}
