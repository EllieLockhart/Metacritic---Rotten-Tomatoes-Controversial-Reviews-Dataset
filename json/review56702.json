Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think about this movie the more I dislike it. So many holes in the plot it\u2019s surprising this was the final version. Here\u2019s a few: 1. Apparently all space ships have the same maximum speed as the first order just couldn\u2019t catch up to the resistance. What?! This was the entire plot line of the movie basically. How did nobody involved question this? 2. When did droids become pets? So the resistance loses half their personnel but Poe is so excited to see bb8 that he gets down and fondles him? He does know it\u2019s just a robot\\, right? 3. How can Rey become an expert swordsman with absolutely no training? Stupid. 4. The liberal social commentary that was forced down the audiences throat during the casino scene was awful. 5. If you can destroy big first order ships by jumping to light speed\\, why not just have a droid pilot an x-wing through one every time? Even if you see them as pets\\, Laura D would still be alive. That\u2019s just a few. Overall\\, pretty disappointing. I honestly feel like a high schooler could have written a better script.","true":true}
