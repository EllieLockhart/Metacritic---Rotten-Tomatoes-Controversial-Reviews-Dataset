Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"old timer here...i remember life on earth before star wars existed. experienced the world change around me that star wars ushered into the world. spent years of my life in wonder amazed at the leaps and bounds in technology and visual effects each film brought. became interested in archetypes and mythology.\\n\\nI don't quite know what it is about this film\\, but i felt like star wars had finally died and i was watching a a film that was 'weekend at bernies'-ing star wars. I loved brick and looper etc... i don't blame rian j.\\, i blame myself i guess\\, for getting old and curmudgeonly and aging out of the demographic i guess. sigh","true":true}
