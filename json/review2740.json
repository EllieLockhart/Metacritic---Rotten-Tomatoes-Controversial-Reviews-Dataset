Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"awful.  how many ways can i dislike this movie as a huge star wars fan?  men are wimps\\, questions are trashed. no character development.  this movie left me angry and it may be worse than jar-jar  binks.  ugh.  horrible.","true":true}
