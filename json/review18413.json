Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is an average movie\\, but an awful Star wars movie. It doesn't really resemble SW and makes no sense. It was my worst experience in Cinema yet\\, and I saw Resident Evil Final chapter there prior to seeing this\\, so you know it's not very good\\, especially if you're a SW fan.","true":true}
