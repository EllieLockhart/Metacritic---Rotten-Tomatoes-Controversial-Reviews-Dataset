Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While funny and entertaining\\, the main plot points are completely disgarded. Rian Johnson is so focused on it's originality that he completely disregards characters that were built up from The Force Awakens. It is completely disrespectful.","true":true}
