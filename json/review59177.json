Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Reading through all the 0 reviews\\, I have to say\\, people are way too sensative. This game is a masterclass in storytelling through video games. The enviroments are breathtakingly well crafted\\, The motion capture animaiton shines through and the lighting really sets the tone of the game. its clear to see that this game is the trials and tribulations of ellie as a character. A revenge story that has Ellie question her choices and review her loyallity to joel. Using unconventional methods of gameplay to get across that theres not heroes or villans here\\, just a 19 year old girl struggling to understand. Anyone that says the game panders to the LGBT crowd is\\, quite frankly\\, a brain dead moron. I doubt Neil Patrick Harris likes to cave in a german shepards skull with a pickaxe. The only issue i have is that the game kinda plays it self at parts but that adds towards the cinematic experience. I highly reccomend this game for anyone who wants a journey through storytelling in video games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
