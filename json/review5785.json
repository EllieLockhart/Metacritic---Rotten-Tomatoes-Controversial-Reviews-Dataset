Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed doesn't begin to cover it. This is a disgusting blot on one of my favorite movie series of all time. I can't believe Kennedy allowed Johnson to vomit all over such an iconic series\\, she should be ashamed of herself. From the very first minute I thought \\\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\\" which proved to be right on the money. I'm disgusted at the way Luke and Leia's characters are denigrated and abused. Two of the most wonderful roles in movie history\\, they don't have a single worthwhile word or deed in the entire movie. For the first time ever watching a Star Wars movie\\, I was bored and disgusted. I hear JJ Abrams is coming back to do IX and if he manages to resurrect the dignity and excitement of Star Wars\\, I'll consider him one of the great writer\/directors of all time. He's surely got his work cut out for him.","true":true}
