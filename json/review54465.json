Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it! The visuals were absolutely stunning. The plot had many surprises that few would predict. The dialog was what one should expect from the earliest movies. When put in context to the purported purpose of the series\\, this episode fits neatly into the genre or serialized science fiction. The movie has all one might ask of the series. There are huge plot holes and scientific impossibilities\\, as with all other Star Wars movies\\, but for pure escapist fun\\, The Last Jedi was one of the years best.","true":true}
