Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only the worst Star Wars movie so far\\, but perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. It has nothing in common with any other Star Wars film save the names of some of the characters. This is clearly just another Disney movie made to move merchandise and entertain young children who've never seen the original trilogy and don't know what plot or character development are. The visuals and the music of John Williams might make it worth the time if it were 90 minutes long\\, but 2.5 hours would be better spent doing just about anything else. Hundreds of other reviewers have already done so\\, so I won't go into the mockery made of the Jedi and the Force in general\\, the absolute travesty of Luke's portrayal\\, the disregard for basic astrophysics\\, or the pointless political correctness. I'm just thankful that I watched it on a plane in order to kill time\\, and I feel terribly for anyone who spent money to see this awful\\, pointless picture.","true":true}
