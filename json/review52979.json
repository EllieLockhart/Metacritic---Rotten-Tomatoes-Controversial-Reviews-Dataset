Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big star wars fan\\, I can never give a star movies just 1 star but I can understand why many would give just 1 star. This movie has maybe around 4 solid moments and 1 good act which is the first but that is all. When watching the film\\, you can instantly know there is political influence which creates uncomfortable moments. Multiple of our main characters have little to nothing to do in the movie while some characters just introduced have a crazy amount of time but it is not entertaining. The plot of the movie is very messy with at times made me wonder why it was there. The first act of the movie might be the best because of the typical star wars battle that everyone likes to see. Finn\\, Leia\\, and Poe have nothing to do and some moments where emotion is about to be created is instantly taken away by another character. The way they handle Supreme Leader Snoke is horrible but I can see their vision of Kylo Ren. General Hux and Captain Phasma are worthless in this film which is unfortunate because they created fear in The Force Awakens. Overall disappointed in the ending where it feels like potential was just left out. The soundtrack of the film is what gives this an entire star because John Williams is a master.","true":true}
