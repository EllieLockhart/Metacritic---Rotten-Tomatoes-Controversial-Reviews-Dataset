Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a good movie.  Poorly written\\, poorly directed\\, and poorly edited.  A lot could've been improved by cutting out certain characters and scenes that interrupted the flow of the film.  Also the writer didn't seem to understand the main characters in the franchise and that fact was evident in the writing.","true":true}
