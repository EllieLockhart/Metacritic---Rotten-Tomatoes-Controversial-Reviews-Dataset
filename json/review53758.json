Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Got the impression that this was the pilot for a TV serial\\, squandered the wealth and depth of material they had to build on\\, whilst the Force Awakens was a disappointment this movie further contributed to my sense that this is a franchise in terminal decline.  Having been an avid follower of Star Wars for the last 40 years I am wondering if it would be best for me to not see future films for fear of contaminating my fond memories with this   thoughtless tripe.","true":true}
