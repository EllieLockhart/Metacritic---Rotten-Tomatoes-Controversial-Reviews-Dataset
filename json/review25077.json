Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nearly all lifelong Star Wars fans are disappointed after seeing The Last Jedi. The Force Awakens was a near perfect set-up\\, yet they somehow managed to ruin it all. Luke Skywalker plays a stubborn old man who doesn't want to leave the island. If he didn't want to go anywhere\\, why did he leave a map to his location? People are arguing this\\, but it's quite obvious he did. Then he finally leaves the island right! Nope! Wrong again! He cuts himself off from the force\\, but then somehow has the power to force project himself to another planet to fool Kylo Ren. This movie was a huge disappointment.","true":true}
