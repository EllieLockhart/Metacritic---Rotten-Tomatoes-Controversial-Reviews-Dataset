Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was the purpose of this movie other than another Hollywood degenerate agenda? Princess Leia played a great and vital role in the original three episodes. She was the trigger point of New Hope leading up to the destruction of the Empire. So why add a foul stench of feminism this franchise when already Star Wars had vigor leading roles for females?","true":true}
