Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a treat to the ears and visually breathtaking but that's as good as it gets. After TFA I couldn't wait to see where they were taking it. Instead we get taken to Canto Bight... By the time we get here I was struggling to enjoy this ride. I bought the Blu-Ray and tried re-watching this and all I did was fast forward past this scene as it felt jarring and utterly distracting. I also struggle to like other parts of the movie like the drawn out space chase\\, the forced jokes \\\"urgent message to Hux\\\"\\, the hyperspace crash and General Organa's 'space walkabout' etc.\\n\\nAll that aside\\, Luke Skywalker is one of my favourite characters and this movie did nothing for me. It wasn't a fitting finale. The Return of the Jedi was where it was at.\\n\\nI wanted to enjoy this film but right now its ranks as the worst of the saga IMO. Maybe when the next film comes out it may improve some of the context in this film (or retcon)\\, it may get a pass. Until then\\, I can't see myself viewing this again in a long while.","true":true}
