Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i have never in my life left a Star Wars film feeing as disappointed\\, overwhelmed\\, and sickened by what i just witnessed for 2 & 1\/2 hours. Forced unnecessary one-liners and comedy\\, too much reliance on cutesy animals than on a cohesive plot with proper characterization and development. an ending that left much to be desired. Terrible writing. Adam Driver's performance was the only thing worthwhile in this. i've been a lifelong fan and after TLJ\\, i'm not sure i'll ever bother with another Star Wars movie and certainly not one Rian Johnson got his hands on.","true":true}
