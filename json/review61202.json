Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Refined and polished game play\\, gorgeous settings\\, fluid and beautiful character animation - while all not surprising\\, the truly masterful part of this game is the depth\\, darkness\\, and parallels of the main characters.\r\rThe first portion of the game is presented for you to feel angry and vengeful just like Ellie\\, but by the time you finish\\, you realize just how terribly similar both Ellie and Abby are. Their need for revenge costs them not only their mental health\\, but the lives and happiness of their loved ones. This goes hand in hand with establishing the fact that the world isn't all about Joel and Ellie and their actions have huge consequences. By the time the final fight started\\, I just wanted both characters to not hurt one another anymore.\r\rI think my only complaint with this game is the strange pacing for the last few hours. It wasn\u2019t inherently bad. I just thought It was ending and it WASN\u2019T. In hindsight\\, I\u2019m glad it had you press on with Ellie who was just relentless\\, desperate\\, and lost\\, and I don\u2019t know how it could have even been done differently. I probably would have taken a break in the middle had I\u2019d known somehow\\, tho.\r\rOverall\\, this game was amazing. It\u2019s the next day and I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It\u2019s been a long time since a video game has affected me this way. Loved it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
