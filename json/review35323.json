Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor REALLY didn't land for me. A lot of characters doing things and making decisions that are inconsistent with their persona\\, or just don't make sense. The Leia \\\"force\\\" scene was terrible\\, uncalled for\\, and just a bad decision carrie fischer pased away and that would have been a great send-off but they messed it up. Luke's death was the most unsatisfying ending in film history and had no payoff. Finn's romance with the resistance chic seemed forced\\, un-earned\\, and fake.","true":true}
