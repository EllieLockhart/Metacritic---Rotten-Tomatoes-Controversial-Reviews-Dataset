Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You wanna know why this movie works? It works because it subverts all of your expectations and goes in directions you don't think it *should* go\\, all so it can bring you right back to what makes \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, and indeed myths and legends of all stripes\\, so powerful and important to our civilization. Full of surprises\\, it takes apart what you *think* is important\\, and shows you why it matters to *not* think it's important. Not only a rip-roaring adventure film\\, but a deep rumination on why we tell these stories in the first place -- and what 'legendary' means. \\n\\nIf you don't get what I'm saying\\, think about that last scene. Right there\\, that bit says it all.","true":true}
