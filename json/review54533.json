Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Imagine A New Hope as a standalone film. That's 'all' there is to Star Wars. \\nImpossible to do now\\, but that's how it was for 3 years when it came out.\\n\\nNow imagine watching Empire for the first time. It changes everything. \\nProbably in ways most people didn't expect. I'm sure many were not happy \\nabout it at the time. As a 9yo child I remember being annoyed (after Jedi) \\nthat Vader was even a human being.\\n\\nThis kind of change is what The Last Jedi has just done to Star Wars! \\n\\nSome hate the changes so much they just come out and just slate it as a \\nbad movie\\, picking at anything and everything. Ignoring the plan fact it is \\narguably the best 'Directed' film in the series. \\n\\nIt went in a direction that was unexpected\\, and unwanted for many\\, though \\nmost would not be able to provide a better alternative that isn't just another \\nretread of a past film. Comparisons to past films being something that \\nnew Star Wars will always have to endure. I'm not even sure how I feel \\nabout many of the directions this film took (on first viewing)\\, but in time I \\nthink this will come to be seen as one of the best Star Wars films there is.","true":true}
