{"101487":195558,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say about the Last Jedi?  How about bad?  Seems like a simple word\\, but the movie is bad.  It's not a bad Star Wars movie\\, it's just a bad movie\\, period!  Before I mention what was bad\\, and there was a lot of bad\\, let me mention the good.  Good effects. Good editing and sound. It better be\\, though\\, since it is a Star Wars movie. What was bad?(SPOILERS!!!!!)Most of the film.  Bad characters(many wasted and unnecessary). Bad character development(very little if at all) Bad plot(most of the characters did things that made no sense for their character. Also side quest\/sub plot accomplished nothing and was a waste of time.). Bad writing(timeline confusing\\, story basically Empire Strikes back\\, with a little Return of the Jedi\\, just in a different order). Bad directing(we have to show Luke fishing\\, milking sea cows and walking around the island?  That's important?). Bad exposition(too much talking and explaining.  Movies are visual). Bad jokes(jokes were forced and not funny. Most of them made me cringe)\\n\\nI saw the movie twice.  I disliked it the first time\\, but thought I was too critical of it\\, so I saw it a second time\\, since I was doing an internet review.  The second time made me really hate it. Overall a very\\, very bad movie. Of all the Star Wars movies and shows out there\\, I would rate it slightly above the Star Wars Christmas Special.  That at least had Boba Fett in it!  Last Jedi has good effects and space scenes\\, but nothing else worth mentioning.","true":true}
