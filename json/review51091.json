Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely exciting film\\, but be prepared for a lot of nostalgic expectations to be broken! The film is clearly about breaking from the past\\, and it was a difficult transition\\, even though I still liked it. The character and plotlines are all complicated in a really satisfying way\\, driving home their better and worse qualities. More difficult-to-swallow themes about war are also brought up. Plus\\, it's all visually gorgeous\\, per usual. My only critique is that there is some humor that is shoehorned into otherwise tense scenes\\, something I feel every Disney film has tried doing since the success of the drier\\, more sarcastic Guardians of the Galaxy. The Porgs are adorable\\, by the way.","true":true}
