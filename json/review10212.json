Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, I don't see what everyone is whining about. Should be rated at about 75-85%\\, not 50%. Definitely better than phantom menace\\, clone wars and revenge of the sith.\\n\\nThere are too many whiners on this site. Too many star wars geeks who need to get a life.","true":true}
