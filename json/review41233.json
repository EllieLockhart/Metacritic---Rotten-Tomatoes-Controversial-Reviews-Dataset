Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is 30 minutes too long\\, becomes tedious near the end\\, some of its subplots are boring and\/or silly and replicates elements in the original film trilogy in a rather unimaginetive fashion. The movie has little to offer to non-fans\\, fans on the other hand will probably love it or hate it (the latter being more probable).","true":true}
