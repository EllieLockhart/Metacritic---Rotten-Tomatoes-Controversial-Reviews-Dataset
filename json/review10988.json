Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen the Last Jedi two times now\\, I am still stuck with that one question .... \\nAll Star Wars movies had shift and drift with regard to their style and target audience.  A New Hope was intended for 'young people'\\, the Empire Strikes Back was aimed at adults . Return of the Jedi introduced the Ewoks to appeal to childeren. Phantom Menace was at best a childerens movie and not until Revenge of the Sith we got back to something that was unmistakingly Star Wars. However\\, all movies had one thing in common\\, they were faithfull to the original backstory\\, characters and respected their loyal audience.  \\nWith the Force Awakens all possibilities were open\\, but in the end the movie just copied many elements from of A New Hope\\, undoubtedly to not alienate the Star Wars audiences just yet. Nevertheless\\, the movie did setup a few interesting characters and storylines\\, and gave hope that it was all carefully building up to a well prepared finale in Star Wars 9 .  \\nFrom this perpective Rogue One is very interesting. The bold new approach and style of this movie was a $200 million dollar gamble. It proved it was possible to create fresh\\, new\\, modernised Star Wars movies that appeal to Star Wars \u00e1nd new audiences alike. For s\u00fare TLJ would follow this path and style development \\, emphasized by the trailers that clearly showed us just what we wanted to see.\\nAnd that leaves you with the question: Why? Why go through all this trouble and preparation\\,  just to bring us The Last Jedi that is a complete breach of style compared to any of the movies.\\nAt no point you have the feeling you are watching a Star Wars movie. No dark sinister plot\\, misplaced humor in stead. The Canto Bight scene was clearly aimed at only children in an otherwise non-children movie. It breaks-off pretty much all story lines and characters (old and new)\\, and seems not to build up to anything. \\nWas there a reason for this cold bucket of water ? Did we do something wrong ? With all the money and talent available\\, could the writers not have come up with a creative story that would respectfully phase-out the old standards and introduce exciting\\, new ones ?  A movie that is somewhat in-line with the rest ? Probably not .....\\nThe last jedi initially did well at the box offices\\, due to clever marketing and the rumours it created\\, but it than started to drop. At this point it is even marginally outperformed by Rogue One on daily revenues and will for sure not match the succes of TFA. It leaves you wondering how all this will affect the next movies ...","true":true}
