Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To start of with\\, this movie is very entertaining.  The space battles\\, lightsaber action\\, and new force abilities\\, bring an enjoyable movie watching experience.  There is a scene in the movie that made me cringe (it was that bad).  But after that misstep\\, you are brought back into the story.  The acting was good all across the board.  Some stand outs would have to be Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo.  Whenever they are on the screen\\, you're sucked in\\, and can't wait to see what happens.  That being said\\, you WILL have to go in with an open mind.  Luke skywalker said it best\\, \\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\".  All the theorys you have are probably all wrong.","true":true}
