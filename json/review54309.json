Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One great film! Quality performances by Hamill and Driver! Brilliant action\\, stunning cinematography\\, fun comedic bits to lighten the tone at times\\, music score weaved and  timed perfectly with the film! Many fanboys angry the movie didn't appeal to their 'head canon' as it took the series in an new and interesting direction!","true":true}
