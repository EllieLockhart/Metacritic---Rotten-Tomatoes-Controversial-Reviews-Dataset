Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whoa! What a race with feelings and action! One of my favorite star wars movies. Rian Johnson\u00b4s directing is awesome\\, story is awesome\\, its orginal. \\nI dont understand all the hates. Its new fresh way to told story from galaxy far far away....\\nP.S: Luke is fucking god of force.","true":true}
