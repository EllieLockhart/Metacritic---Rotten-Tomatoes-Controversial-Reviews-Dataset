Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reaks of trying to hard. Tries to be funny\\, tries to be serious\\, tries to be whimsical. Fails each time. Luke and Leia are under utilised. The plot is benign. The Star Trek references are terrible. Rey was like a different person from the Force Awakens. More make up and less real.  There is no story flow\\, no character flow. At least George Lucas's horribly scripted prequels made sense in the Star Wars realm. This does not and actually makes me feel worse about the Force Awakens.","true":true}
