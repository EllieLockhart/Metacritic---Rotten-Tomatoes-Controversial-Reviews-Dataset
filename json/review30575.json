{"101487":166982,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up to add a review. Never felt compelled to before but just wanted to add my voice to some of the 'OTT' reviews I've read\\, particularly from professional critics.  Probably for the first time\\, the consensus of critic reviews has not mirrored my own experience of a movie.  I'm not sure whether there's some hidden agenda for this but it is very interesting nonetheless.  I've heard rumours about Disney cutting out reviewers who slate their movies\\, even if done from a constructive criticism perspective.  Anyway\\, as I write\\, the Tomatometer is 93% but the audience score is 56%.  That's quite a big disconnect that is unusual in itself.\\nSo\\, to the movie.  Disney is clearly aiming this at a young audience and once can't help but think that some of the additions (Porgs I'm looking at you) were added to cash in on the young crowd.  Fair enough\\, I don't mind if the movie itself is a good one but all things considered it is not in my opinion.  Yes\\, Mark Hamill's performance was very good and the special effects\\, sound and visual scope of the movie were excellent.  But some many things jar.\\n1)\tWhy build up Snoke in the last movie and then kill him off without any warning\\, or indeed\\, any backstory whatsoever?   Rian Johnson seems intent on wiping out a lot of the previous movie (as well as the old characters) to bring in new characters and stories.  I understand this\\, but why wait until the end of the 2nd movie (in this trilogy) to do that?\\n2)\tSince when has Leia shown any inclination to able to force float 'Superman style' through open space?  AFAIK\\, she has never received any Jedi training or any interest in it.  I understand that she needs to have a big send-off but it was dumb.\\n3)\tSo\\, the bulky First Order Star Destroyers were slower at sub light speed than the Alliance capital ships.  Ok\\, got it.  But what's to stop other Star Destroyers warping ahead to the rebel base to cut them off.  Or warping all around the rebel fleet to enclose them in?  I mean they've got loads of these ships right?  The old Imperial Navy had thousands of Star Destroyers.  Whilst the New Order probably can't match that\\, surely they've got more than 5-7\\, which is all I could count.\\n4)\tIf Kylo 'Ben Solo' Ren is so powerful with the force\\, surely he'd be able to tell the difference between a force projection and the real thing?  Surely he would have sensed that Luke was light years away on Ahch-To instead of right there in front of him?  And surely the New Order can come up with something a bit better than that silly cannon that needs to be dragged everywhere by the looks of it.  Or plug the glaring weaknesses that has affected their capital ships since ANH.  That is\\, one small fighter can completely disable a Star Destroyer's inner defences and make it totally vulnerable to being blown to smithereens.\\nI'm going to stop there as there are load of things that make no sense but I can't be bothered listing them all.  Suffice to say that the movie was deeply disappointing from a plot and story viewpoint and that I'm not sure I will trust a high Tomatometer score in quite the same way I used to.","true":true}
