Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would say I liked The Last Jedi (TLJ) better than The Force Awakens (TFA)\\, but then I realised it is actually more like saying I disliked TLJ less than TFA. As usual some plot lines still maintain the Original Trilogy mirroring. But director Rian Johnson is really doing a lot his own things here and taking bold and controversial turns\\, even to disregarding JJ Abrams' take with TFA which I already had bones to pick. I really don't know where they are taking this sequel trilogy as there doesn't seem to be any story arc or road map ahead. Well at least I really enjoyed the opening battle sequence\\, that felt like Star Wars.","true":true}
