{"101487":123021,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"God this movie was a hot mess and painful\\, so very very painful. I am not going to pick apart the nearly countless plot holes of the longest race in space\\, because everyone else is already doing that and much better than I ever could. I also am not going to talk politics because that also is being covered and I dont care. What I do care about was Star Wars and what this movie could have been\\, but the truth be told\\, this was one of the worst\\, most illogical movies I have ever seen. I would not have thought it was possible to make a Star Wars movie this incoherent in terms of the franchise history and so poorly written that every problem in the movie the charters encounter is deux machina and every solution basically the same.\\n\\nLike many I saw the originals in the theater but I was not expecting or wanting to \\\"return to my childhood\\\" and now am just a bitter old man. To be honest Mark was never the greatest actor (aside from his amazing voice-over which is outstanding) he was b grade a best and Carrie and Harrison were really not all that great either. BUT that is part of what made Star Wars work because we the viewer\\, us average Jane's and Joe's could relate to them and they really worked well together and the movies were fun and we loved them.\\n\\nStar Wars was the ultimate underdog series\\, a naive nobody farm boy who turns out to be someone\\, a dashing rogue and a intelligent diplomat fighting a revolution all thrown together and somehow finding a way to work together and for each of them to fulfill their goals and character arcs. Most importantly these characters who had so little in common with each other worked together with amazing synergy - the viewers could relate\\, one way or another to the people they were seeing on the screen. I could not relate to anyone in TLJ they all seemed to be created and given rolls closer to Saved By The Bell stereotypes\\, (if you think about it you will see how closely many of the charters match -- Zach\/Po\\, Screech\/Finn... you get the idea).\\n\\nSomehow the 2.5 hour long TLJ made a galaxy far far away seem to be so so small. I know a lot of people have focused on how the casino act could have been tossed and made the film shorter and better as it served no purpose other than to give Finn something to do\\, and yes that is 100% true\\, it was the worst and most meaningless part of the film\\, but it was also the only part of the film that made you think there actually was a huge living galactic civilization of planets\\, people and crazy creatures. If it wasn't for the casino planet\\, all we saw of the galaxy were a couple uninhabited planets\\, a handful of rebel ships and bunch of bad guys in space. This ended up being smallest scope and least \\\"Star Wars\\\" setting film ever made and frankly utterly devoid anything we the viewers should care about protecting. In fact the only part of the galaxy we really see that has any life is populated by \\\"evil arms dealers\\\" ...\\n\\nThe First Order would never have taken over the galaxy. They are so incompetent that it actually hurts to think about how badly they were written and portrayed. The fact the great chase even happened\\, that Po lived past the opening scene\\, that their countless Tie fighters are only deployed after the rebels have struck or only in enough numbers to allow them to be defeated drove me nuts. \\\"Sir we have our fighter squadrons standing by\\, we can have total air superiority over the planet with 1000 Tie Fighters within minutes... hmm I think sending 6 should be more than enough don't you? Its not like the Millennium Falcon is going to show up and lead them away so they can crash into the walls of some underground chambers\\\".\\n\\nObviously the First Order have the greatest scientific minds in the universe\\, creating hyperspace trackers\\, weapons and armor that can match or beat lightsabers\\, shrinking the death star weapon to be small enough they can deploy it on the battlefield to knockout the installation doors\\, (yes they said this in the film) etc but the actual leaders\/troops running their fleet and army are so stupid\\, so inept\\, so badly written by someone who obviously had no idea of military tactics\\, training or war or doesn't care to present a enemy with any intelligence or desire to \\\"win a battle\\\". So if they can shrink the deathstar weapon down to be used on planet fortifications... why arnt there death star rays on each of the countless star destroyers that could have blasted the rebels apart at the beginning? oh because they did not need them then it would have ruined the rest of the movie we had planned!\\n\\nAnd as far a Kylo and Huxxy boy... these two are going to run a galaxy? Kylo is going to be able to deal with diplomats\\, trade negotiations\\, making sure R&D continues\\, the military grows and controls systems\\, managing thousands and thousands of planets\\, countless trillions of people\\, etc?? His ONLY MOTIVATION has been to kill daddy\\, kill Luke\\, kill Rey when she wont be his friend\\, and smash stuff when it doesn't go as planned. He is the new Supreme Leader.. give me a break\\, he makes Kim Jung Un look like Teddy Roosevelt.\\n\\nI really liked Rey in The Force Awakens (Mary Sue or not) and felt she had the right potential for a hero in Star Wars... Finn and Po might have worked out\\, but we will never know. The movies have not kept them together long enough for US to believe they really matter or to even care about them. They are almost never together\\, so you have 3 protagonists\\, all doing their thing\\, with their own supposed reasons and not put together so we the viewers can care about them in any meaningful way\\, and make their relationships with each other believable... rather always kept apart. Instead they tell us they care about each other. Ultimately this is one of this films biggest flaws is that they tell us everything we need to know. They explain everything and wrap it up with a pretty bow and we do not need to think about anything\\, (but if we do...oh the pain it causes our brains trying to wrap around this idiocy).\\n\\nAt the end of the movie they kept telling us about the spark that will start the revolution.... so a dozen rebels (all that's left from thousands? tens of thousands?) on a junker of a space ship\\, are going to spread the word about how the First Order kicked their asses\\, destroyed all their ships\\, killed them almost to a man\/woman but then \\\"Luke Skywalker\\\" showed up and... and... and really did not do anything. He did not kill anyone\\, he did not destroy anything... yeah he stalled the bad guys\\, but only because it was written for them needing to be stalled... so Luke showed up and now he is gone and so now what? What was the point? THAT IS THE SPARK that will get people to stand up against the First Order? Not the last movie when they destroyed the Starkiller Base... when they actually did something... no that did not mean crap to the galaxy's inhabitants... its the dozen idiots escaping salt world that will be the spark. Give me a break!\\n\\nWhy should we care for any of the characters? Why should we care if the resistance wins or not? Do we even know what\/who they are even really fighting for? At this point I don't care anymore.","true":true}
