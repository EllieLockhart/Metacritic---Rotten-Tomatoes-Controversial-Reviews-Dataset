Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes. worst star wars I've seen. Ill leave it to the many other reviews to talk more about everything wrong with it. It's just impossible to get past Rey being an invincible Jedi automatically with 0 training. ","true":true}
