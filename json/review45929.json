Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually Amazing\\, but that doesnt make up for the absolute destruction of the story and horrible characters.  I understand you have to kill off the old guard\\, but to turn all their characters into losers and then give them loser deaths is insulting to the fanbase.  There were so many other problems with the movie\\, I can't even scratch the surface here.  Worst SW film ever\\, that includes Phantom Menace.","true":true}
