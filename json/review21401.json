Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could un-watch to keep my childhood alive. Lukes story arc is an insult to fans of the original trilogy. Mark Hamill's strong performance is the only bright spark in this plot hole laden disasterpiece.","true":true}
