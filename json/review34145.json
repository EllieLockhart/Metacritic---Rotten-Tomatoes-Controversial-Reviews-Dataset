Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks for all the bad reviews! It lowered my expectations and I really enjoyed it. Funny how quickly people forget all of the weird things from previous movies. Remember how weird it was that Lea and Luke had a romantic thing? How about Jar Jar\\, ewoks\\, and other stupid cute things from past movies. Whiny Anakin as a kid and a teenager. Fans act like these things are new\\, but these things have been there since the beginning. I had fun and there were some great scenes.","true":true}
