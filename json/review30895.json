Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social Justice ruins yet another Star Wars movie. Absolutely ridiculous 2 dimensional characters with no depth. Tries too hard to tick all the politically correct identity boxes.. Obnoxious female leaders\\, weak pathetic emotionally unstable and submissive males\\, clownish white men\\, token minorities. Disconnected plots. Only positive\\, the effects were good so there's something.","true":true}
