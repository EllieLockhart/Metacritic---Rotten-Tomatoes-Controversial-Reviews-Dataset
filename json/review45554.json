Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. No good questions answered\\, horrific hole-filled plot and one of the worst scripts I've ever heard put to a screenplay. Disney and the team behind this should be ashamed. Very little to enjoy in this film.","true":true}
