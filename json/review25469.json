Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No respectable critic can watch this movie with its bad characterization\\, uneven pace\\, uninspired plot\\, tone-deaf jokes\\, and supposed \\\"twists\\\" (that are only twists because nobody expected such bad writing) and even think this movie is passable. Copied from another reviewer\\, because this puts it better than I ever could: \\\"People that love the mindless spectacle will like it. People that ask for coherent storytelling will not.\\\"","true":true}
