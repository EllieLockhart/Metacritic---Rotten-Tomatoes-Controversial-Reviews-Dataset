Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an excellent film and everything a Star Wars movie should be in the post-Lucas era. If we can't get a sequel trilogy made by the man himself\\, then this is the next best thing. It's fresh\\, inventive\\, and not as beholden to tradition as TFA was. Its theme of inclusivity that anyone and everyone is connected by the Force is a timely and comforting message for our times. And every single \\\"questionable\\\" plot decision can be defended as useful for essential character development!","true":true}
