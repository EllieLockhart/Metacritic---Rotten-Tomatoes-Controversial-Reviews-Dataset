Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part 2 is a brutal\\, beautiful\\, often gut-wrenching look into the world of revenge and pain. The story presented is one that ask the player to think deeper about the violent acts most video games have play out with little meaning and consequence.

However\\, the experience doesn\u2019t ask thatThe Last of Us Part 2 is a brutal\\, beautiful\\, often gut-wrenching look into the world of revenge and pain. The story presented is one that ask the player to think deeper about the violent acts most video games have play out with little meaning and consequence. There are narrative choices within this game that will undoubtedly ruffle some feathers. However\\, the experience doesn\u2019t ask that you sympathize with every character along the way as much as it ask you to understand the meaning behind their actions. Our protagonist\\, Ellie is someone who isn\u2019t without flaws and shortcomings but is a great representation for all the characters in this game in that they\u2019re people trying to survive in a world that despite being unbelievable is portrayed in a very real light. She\u2019s not one note but rather complex and thought out. The same can be said for most of the characters within the game. The story and it\u2019s themes are without question one of (if not the) most daring ever put to the screen.    The gameplay is responsive\\, visceral\\, quick and plays out with some of the most intensely satisfying action set pieces seen within the video game sphere. Some have said it is repetitive and to that I can only say that during my personal play through I found each encounter was filled with an array of options\\, tactics\\, and ideas I couldn\u2019t wait to integrate. The gameplay won\u2019t let you slack as the enemies are some of the most impressive ever seen; they communicate\\, are lethal\\, and the player has to think quickly to make it out of every battle.    The graphics are unprecedented. The time spent capturing scenes\\, sets\\, atmospheres\\, etc. was plentiful and always worth it. There were more than a few times in which I simply had to stop to take it all in. I will always remember the first time I played though this game because It marks a true change in what I thought was possible graphically.    All that being said\\, I write this as someone who idealistically doesn\u2019t agree with every creative decision and character along the way. But from an objective standpoint the overall experience offered by The Last of Us Part 2 is one that without question is a brilliant\\, masterclass in video game design. At the end of the day\\, this Is a game that is breaking new grounds on every front: story\\, characters\\, gameplay\\, graphics\\, etc. I advise anyone and everyone to give it a try if able\\, regardless of any pre conceived notions or leaks. The Last of Us Part 2 is nothing short of a true masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
