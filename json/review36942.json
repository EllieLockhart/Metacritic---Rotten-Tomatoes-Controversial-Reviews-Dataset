Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was honestly fantastic. Plenty of action that fans love and a lot of questions answered. There are some characters that die that honestly needed to because of the movies direction into newer characters and a new storyline. There were some questions that were left unanswered\\, but what's a star wars film without cliffhangers?","true":true}
