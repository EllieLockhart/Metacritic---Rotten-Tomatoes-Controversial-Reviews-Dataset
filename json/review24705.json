Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was overall exciting... i am a huge skywalker fab like everyone else but it is time to move on to a new group.. only scene i didnt like was the superman one lol but what are you gonna do.","true":true}
