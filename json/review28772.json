Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly the best Star Wars film to date. The themes explored and the entire style of this film are fantastic. It feels very human and has a lovely balance between humor and serious tones. It takes Star Wars in completely new directions\\, which is incredibly bold\\, but very welcomed. This brings hope for the future of the franchise.","true":true}
