Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. What a disappointing mess. I've never left a review here on RT before\\, but I felt the need to\\, because I think the 90% critic rating is completely ridiculous. I stayed spoiler free\\, going into TLJ. And having seen nothing but the glowing critic reviews\\, I had high hopes. After watching it\\, I was left wondering if I saw the same movie they saw. Plot holes alone\\, wreck this film. Character development is either non existent\\, or so far off base that it removes you from the experience. Things that were set up from TFA were abandoned with no explanation. There are lots of honest YouTube reviews out there\\, that break down everything that went wrong with this film\\, so I'll avoid posting spoilers here. But it makes me sad to see something that I've loved since I was a child\\, turned into this. Hopefully with JJ Abrams coming back to helm the next installment\\, it can be turned around. But unfortunately\\, the damage is done. I'm giving this movie one star\\, because it was visually pretty stunning. That's about all it had going for it\\, though.","true":true}
