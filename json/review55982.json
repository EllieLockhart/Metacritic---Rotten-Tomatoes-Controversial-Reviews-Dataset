Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly\\, It's Not Worth Buying or Renting...\\nThe Last Jedi is a movie you'll want to wait and watch for free on TV or at a friend's house. It's not even worth buying from the $5 bin. I saw it twice in the theaters\\, and there are plenty of valid reasons why this movie is hovering around 3 stars - far too many to explain here. In short\\, the story is full of major inconsistencies\\, contradictions\\, and irrationalities in comparison to not only the previous Star Wars trilogies\\, but to The Force Awakens and to itself. These kinds of problems can be found in any film (including all previous Star Wars films)\\, but The Last Jedi is filled to the brim with them. Yes\\, the cinematography is beautiful\\, the special effects are amazing\\, the sound and music are great\\, and the acting is well-performed\\, but all of that cannot make up for the poorly-written story\\, which is where this movie falls flat on its face. The script really needed to go through some major revisions before being given the green light to be filmed. It's a shame that a lot of money and a lot of people's talents went into making such a poorly-written script. Save your money and watch it for free to see for yourself.","true":true}
