Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was entertaining and interesting. I liked what they did with Luke and even though it may not be similar to him in the original trilogy\\, I thought it still made sense seeing as he's on an island by himself for years.\\n\\n[SPOILERS AHEAD]\\n\\nI also liked that Rey and Snoke weren't tied to the original trilogy. They can make new characters in a new set of movies. Rey doesn't have to be the daughter of Luke or Leia to be cool.","true":true}
