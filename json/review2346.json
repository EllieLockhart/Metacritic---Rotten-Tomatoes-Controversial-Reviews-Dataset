Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Attempting to prove your audience's expectations wrong at every possible point of the movie doesn't make for a smart film. All the progress from the first movie was thrown in the garbage\\, and I really feel bad for the poor sucker who has to direct the sequel to this.","true":true}
