Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WISH IT WAS BETTER!#\\nI was very excited to see this (who wasn't\/isn't) and while there were bits of this that were the best of Star Wars\\, there was so so so so many forced\\, clunky\\, lazy\\, virtually breaking the 3rd wall with the knowing humor schtick gags that it was almost totally ruined for me. A shame\\, such a shame. Let's hope there's time to re-think Rian Johnson taking the helm for a raft more installments- Go see it\\, do but best to go in with low expectations.","true":true}
