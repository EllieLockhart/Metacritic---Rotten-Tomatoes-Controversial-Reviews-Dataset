Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Just terrible. Ruins all the setups from its prequel\\, and takes a big\\, reeking dump all over the legacy of the original trilogy- and most notably\\, Luke Skywalker. Although not entirely Rian Johnson's fault due to the ludicrously vague plan set by Disney\\, I believe he should have rejected the offer of directing the film\\, and let JJ Abrams continue on his admittedly decent The Force Awakens.","true":true}
