Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is extremely enjoyable.  The sets and sequences are jaw-dropping.  The humor is sprinkled in\\, more so than any other Star Wars movie.  The Last Jedi introduces new\\, fresh plotlines and still honors past movies.  It's a new direction for Star Wars\\, that needs to be embraced.  The action scenes are well choreographed and led to many OOs and AAHHs in the theater.  This really complemented the slightly weaker Force Awakens.  I cannot wait until the next one.","true":true}
