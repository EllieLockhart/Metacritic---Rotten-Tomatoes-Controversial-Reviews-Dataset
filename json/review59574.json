The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"When I finished this game\\, I didn\u2019t like it. I felt like they really went with a messy story on this one. That was until I sat back and let it marinate. The more and more I thought of it\\, the more I realized why Neil and company had made this game so polarizing. The same reason why Ellie couldn\u2019t let go of her want for revenge\\, we couldn\u2019t let go of the hurt we experienced when Joel died.When I finished this game\\, I didn\u2019t like it.

The same reason why Ellie couldn\u2019t let go of her want for revenge\\, we couldn\u2019t let go of the hurt we experienced when Joel died. Sure we feel hatred for Abby\\, that was exactly the point. But if you are willing to unconditionally love the game for what it is and not what you wanted it to be\\, you can totally enjoy and understand a game. Troy Baker made this point about the game in an interview and it really opened my eyes on why this really is a masterpiece. Not everyone is willing to believe that\\, in fact I had some struggles with it too but it all depends on how long you want to let go of what could\u2019ve been and not what is. At the end of the day\\, this game is what it is and I\u2019m sure everyone who\u2019s played it from start to finish would agree that when it shines\\, it **** shines. Once you go back to the first game and realize how different and yet how similar a game it is to it\u2019s sequel\\, you notice that Naughty Dog was never planning to do anything like it again. Sequels need to do something new and the fact that it\u2019s getting hate\\, means that it\u2019s really doing it\u2019s job\\, other than the fact that the leaks made some people stubborn. Ultimately\\, I now understand why critics say this is a masterpiece\\, even though the word has been overused. Take your time with it because it is the game of the year\\, no question\\, and it will be a polarizing release in Naughty Dog\u2019s catalog for years to come. Don\u2019t listen to those who tell you how you should feel about the game. **** them. Play it for yourself and feel about it what you will. Peace.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
