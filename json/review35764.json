Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is everything the Star Wars saga needed. The need of showing a moral conflict between the light and itself\\, of showing a conflicted Luke Skywalker who loses faith on the Jedi\\, was evident since Episode 1. Star Wars finally broke the predictable moral line and crossed it completely. It is what Star Wars needed.","true":true}
