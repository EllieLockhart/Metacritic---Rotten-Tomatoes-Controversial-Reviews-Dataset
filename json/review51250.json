Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely perfect sequel to Force Awakens and a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise! Good job Mr Rian Johnson\\, what an amazing movie. I truly do not understand all the hate\\, the movie had a perfect balance of new\\, original material and plot lines\\, and nostalgic callbacks. The characters are all wonderful\\, have fantastic arcs\\, and Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher deliver the best performances of their careers. There are some truly breathtaking scenes in this movie and it it's full of suspense and pure Star Wars fun. Full of twists and turns\\, this movie is quite the experience from the second the crawl starts. Best one since Empire for sure. I can't say this enough\\, GO SEE IT!!!","true":true}
