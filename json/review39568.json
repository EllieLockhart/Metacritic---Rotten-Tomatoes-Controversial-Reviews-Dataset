Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was ok. I would not consider it a waste of my time to watch it\\, but it is not a great movie. Weak story at best and the hero's growth from zero to hero took massive leaps. One minute\\, nobody\\, next minute jedi master.  Come on!!!!","true":true}
