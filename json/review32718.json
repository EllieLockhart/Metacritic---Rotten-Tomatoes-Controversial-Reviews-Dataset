Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars : The Last Jedi\\n\\nGiven what they had to work with (the greatest and most popular franchise in history\\, plus the Star Wars characters and universe)... The Last Jedi is the worst movie ever made.  This story\\, theme\\, events and characters in this movie are massively incoherent\\, inconsistent\\, contradictory and disrespectful compared to episodes 1\\, 2\\, 3\\, 4\\, 5\\, 6.  Just horrible.  Don't waste your money on this piece of SJW garbage.  On a scale of 0 to 10\\, this movie deserves -10 (that's minus ten).","true":true}
