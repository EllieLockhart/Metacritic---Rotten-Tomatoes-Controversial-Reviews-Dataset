Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cool looking movie\\, watched it twice already as I couldn't decide how I felt after the first time. Kylo Ren was my favorite character coming out of this movie\\, most interesting anyway. But overall\\, it should have been called \\\"The Battle of Crait: A Star Wars Story\\\" and been an interlude between episode 7 and 8. Nothing happened. Kind of a waste of an episode\\, disappointed now that we only have one left.","true":true}
