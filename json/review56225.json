Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi boldly goes where no other... wait\\, that's not the right series\\, is it?\\n\\nSeriously\\, though\\, TLJ breaks new and exciting ground for Star Wars.  While many complained that The Force Awakens was just a repeat of many plot beats of A New Hope\\, this film thrusts the fanbase far out of its comfort zone into a galaxy far far away that feels familiar yet still fresh.  \\n\\nIn fact\\, The Last Jedi subverts audience expectation almost like it's going out of style.  When\\, in the trailer\\, Luke quoted \\\"This is not going to go how you think\\\"\\, many fans had rightly speculated that it also may have been a meta commentary on fan expectation in this film.  \\n\\nHamill delivers what may be his best performance as Luke Skywalker\\, and Carrie Fischer does an incredible job in what is sadly her final Hollywood performance as General Leia Organa.  \\n\\nThe film is funny when it means to be\\, heartbreaking when it needs to be\\, and persistently intense.  \\n\\nOh\\, and the porgs are great- funny\\, cute\\, and far from overdone.  Honestly\\, as a former skeptic of them\\, I could've even user some more porg.","true":true}
