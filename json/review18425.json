Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a unique Star Wars film going in a totally unexpected direction but truly superb. One section in the middle was strange and seemed out of place but it\u2019s forgiven as the rest of the film is visually stunning and beautifully written. The lack of a simple plot and treating the audience as adults is a breath of fresh air \ud83d\ude00","true":true}
