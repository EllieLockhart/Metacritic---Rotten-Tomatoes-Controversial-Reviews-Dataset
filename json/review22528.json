Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start out by saying this movie is built upon the idea that the film itself should subvert any expectations an audience member may have towards a star wars film. Truthfully\\, there is nothing inherently bad about poking a stick at your own identity. The problem is when all that poking doesn't give rise to a clear change of direction or new identity.\\nThis film challenges audience expectations without forming a new basis of identity. As a matter of fact\\, this film deals in the middle ground between dark and light. Never committing to take that cinematic leap towards either side.\\nAs an audience member you are left scrambling to understand why the film happened in the first place.\\nI am genuinely unsure as to whether or not this film has any redeeming quality beyond its own self sacrifice. \\nEpisode 8 needed to give me reasons to care. I mean that in the vaguest sense because in typical JJ Abrams fashion\\, TFA left plenty of loose ends and developmental holes that needed filling.\\nThose ends needed to be tied. This film instead lit them all on fire and watched them burn .. but seemingly not for the audiences sake. \\nEven as a stand alone movie\\, TLJ was terrible. \\nThere is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about how shockingly weak this movie was.\\nWorst SW film of all time .. and its by a long shot. Which is an achievement unto itself ... I suppose","true":true}
