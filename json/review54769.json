{"101487":140202,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-31","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It destroys SW. It's an inconsistent movie\\, Finn saying hyperspace is not possible\\, and 2 minutes later knows all the details of it. The chase is absurd and boring\\, The First Order shouldn't have any problems sending more fleets just in front of them to cath them\\, also\\, they don't have faster ships? any civilian ship can outrun the first order if they don't have that tracker thingy? A dumb thing also\\, in the OT there's tracking. It's stupid that they only send 4 fighters to fight the Rebel\/Resistance(they keep changing the name in the movie)\\, they don't have more fighters in their 20 cruisers? Even in the OT we saw more fighters. Luke character is destroyed. Every plot opened in TFA is eliminated in the most absurd ways...The new SJW admiral behaves like and idiot\\, not telling anyone the plan for no reason\\, even when a mutiny takes place(you take Poe and tell him\\, he's no damm spy\\, he just destroyed Starkiller Base you moron\\, also\\, if there's a spy\\, the plan wouldn't work anyway). They treat Poe like a reckless idiot\\, but he actually makes all the good calls\\, he's demoted for destroying a ship that would've kill them all. They make Husk a joke(where are military leaders like Tarkin?)\\, all the movie is full with stupid jokes in the worst possible timing\\, every serious situation has a stupid joke to ruin it. Rey is more a Mary Sue than ever\\, using force powers like nothing\\, defeating Luke\\, fighting elite guards after one day training\\, by herself\\, against a rock....Also\\, the worst fight in all the movies\\, no reason for it(what are the guards doing attacking Kylo? Is not their new boss?)\\, full of mistakes\\, guards flipping and exposing their backs to the enemy\\, guards aiming to the air or the weapons instead of attacking the exposed heads of Kylo and Rey\\, weapons than dissapear\\, no force powers being used....A joke\\, and it's the best part of the movie\\, sadly. Canto Bight just a waste of time\\, the plot about selling weapons is also absurd\\, it doesn't make much sense that the Rebels and the First Order got different weapons from the same buyer\\, also\\, makes more sense that they create their own weapons\\, specially the First Order\\, they have the most advanced weaponary in the galaxy\\, that should come from their own I+D\\, no from buyers. Does the buyers sell Death Stars also? TFO can create Death Stars and not fighters? There's nothing to save in this movie but the visuals and acting of some characters\\, not worth spending more money on SW ever again\\, or at least until they say this movie never happened and make something coherent at least\\, I'm not even asking for good anymore.","true":true}
