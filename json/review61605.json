Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I\u2019ll start with the positive then proceed with the negative.\r\rPositives-\r\rThe graphics are excellent. I would slow down my gameplay just to take in the scenery.\r\rNegatives-\r\rThe game play is repetitive with very few new enemy challenges.\r\rThis game was delayed and still had bugs where people would spawn often right beside me.\r\rThe characters you play don\u2019t develop. They are mostly angry\\, bitter\\, and thoughtless\\, but for a few moments of humanity.\r\rYou have no options to make decisions which makes it feel like your forced do things not in Ellie\u2019s character. I would sit there and not press the button the game was indicating I press. Its the first time playing a game I thought\\, this is miserable. Unfortunately\\, it\u2019s just a downward spiral for her character.\r\rAbby is an unlikeable angry person who cheats with a guy who\u2019s girlfriend is pregnant. He\u2019s an unlikeable POS too. Their whole group is unlikeable. Being forced to play her character was not fun. I rushed through her sections of the game which unfortunately is a huge part of the game. She does one good thing and I guess we are supposed to feel like she has been redeemed. Nope. Also her father is a unethical doctor who didn\u2019t inform his patient he was going to kill her before being he put under anesthesia. Abby is an angry sociopath and her deceitful father got killed because of his own horrible decisions. Joel prevented Ellie\u2019s murder.\r\rIt was apparent early on revenge will take more than it gives. But that is the core of the story and repeatedly reinforced ad nauseam. This drives the plot to nowhere. Nothing was gained by the experience. We literally end with less family\\, less digits\\, less purpose than when we began which I understand is the point but what a disappointing experience. Its like GOT or the SW trilogy. When your ending is bad it ruins everything that comes before. I replayed the first game twice. This game has no replay value.\r\rWe get the point. Revenge is bad.\r\rRed Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent game because the characters have story arcs. They change and develop and realize life doesn\u2019t have to be misery. This game begins with misery\\, with some misery  in the middle\\, a blip of hope\\, then a strong miserable ending.\r\rIn summation. Excellent job and creating a graphically beautiful game. Boo for releasing a game with bugs still in it even after a delay. It\u2019s misery and depression with amazing graphics.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
