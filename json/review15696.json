Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I'm a die-hard SW fan. Was born in 77 have grown up with the movies my whole life. I don't think I've loved a SW film this much since ESB. It's not a perfect film\\, but then again neither was Empire. But I love how they twisted expectations- sometimes the hero's fail\\, sometimes the wild and crazy plan doesn't succeed. Set backs and hardships and the heart to overcome them is a huge part of SW. So is failure! LOL. People are made that Luke \\\"failed\\\" temple destroyed\\, Ben evil\\, etc. But look at Obi-wan and Yoda\\, they \\\"failed\\\" as well. I love how human this new Trilogy makes the original trilogy characters. It's like the original trilogy is the myth that we've been told about these people and now we're getting to see the reality- and reality is messy but more beautiful for it's complexities.","true":true}
