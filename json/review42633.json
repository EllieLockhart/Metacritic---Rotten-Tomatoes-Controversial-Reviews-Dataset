Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  Forced Humor that wasn't funny\\, way too much effort on special effects and CGI. This movie is definitely just a cash crop. After the Force Awakens I had high hopes for this movie as I really enjoyed it. This movie was such a let down and makes me not want to see any future star wars movies from Disney.","true":true}
