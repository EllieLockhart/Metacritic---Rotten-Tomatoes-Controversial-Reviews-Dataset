Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so they build Snoke up and dead! Luke didn't do shit\\, and we wanted to see a Luke vs Snoke\\, nope! Kylo killed him by a trick! Do we get a Snoke backstory? Nope. The First order chasing the Resistance\\, Hey let's not send 100 ships to kill the last of resistance\\, let's wait for them to run out of fuel. Come on now really tie fighters can't fly from battle ships. Did they not watch originals.\\nThis was awful! They wasted Snoke they built him up and then nothing. The casino scene had no point\\, the writing and pacing was awful. So why is Luke wearing a Jedi outfit when Rey shows up and then doesn't care about the Jedi! They wasted Luke and Snoke and the story was awful . I'm so disappointed. That's my take!","true":true}
