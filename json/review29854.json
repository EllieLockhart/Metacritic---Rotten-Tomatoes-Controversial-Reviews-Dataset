Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RJ elevates Star Wars and doesn't rely on nostalgia to do so. A stellar performance from the whole cast\\, and a story line that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Fantastic.","true":true}
