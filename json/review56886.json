Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was so much inconstancy in this film that I'm more than convinced that either no one actually read the script and took it seriously except Mark Hamill or that there were a lot of yes men that said it was fine. Characters pretty much abandon their own personalities between films and even during this one. Rey pretty much learns nothing since she already has every skillset though at least she gets a slight cut this time around. Kylo Ren is the only character to stay the same which is a slight positive given everything else in the film and is by far the most interesting of the newcomers with Finn a close 2nd (though this movie sets him back a bit).\\n\\nCertain mechanics introduced now make everyone question why they weren't used before. Story-lines\/events lead to nothing\\, lots of elements pulled from Episode 5 for that nostalgia factor even if it makes no sense (the Salt Troopers)\\, the list goes on.\\n\\nHonestly\\, if you're really a fan of this series and are able to give it fair criticism like everything else then the many flaws with this film should be very obvious to you. It's fine to like it but it so no where near a good film compared to the ones before it. I wouldn't be surprised if this gets retconned somehow with Episode 9.\\n\\nIf you're able to turn off your brain for the next couple of hours then this is a good B movie","true":true}
