Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"91%? Clearly voted for by blinkered Star Wars devotees who will accept any old contrived tosh as a work of genius. I lasted one hour five minutes\\, before succumbing to boredom in the form of a lovely nap. It was yet another prosaic space battle that did it. The Last Jedi (bloody hell\\, I hope so) is not quite as dreadful as Rogue One; I managed all the way through that one though\\, mainly because of the unintentional humour and that Felicity Jones was pleasant to look at. Not even the delightful Daisy Ridley could keep me alive during this. In space there is a vacuum; there was also one in my mind during this. Everything looks familiar in these Star Wars movies. If a Star Wars movie was a vinyl record\\, you could be blindfolded and drop the needle on all the major plot points and battles.","true":true}
