Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot!\\n\\nThis movie feels like a joke parody of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens\\, which was criticized for being a rehash of the original Star Wars.  This movie feels like it is making fun of The Force Awakens by also blatantly copying visuals and plot threads from the original trilogy...except this time they just reverse the result of each storyline...it gets so predictable when you have a \\\"GOTCHA!\\\" moment every 10 minutes.\\n\\nWhat kind of business decision is this?  They took an adventure fantasy franchise aimed at people of all ages and cultures....and turned it into slow space chase scene...like Mad Max Fury Road or Speed but this time in space at 1 mile per hour.....and on top of that lecture the audience about social issues...in an adventure blockbuster that is supposed to entertain people of all ages from all walks of life??  Lucasfilm what were you thinking?  Disney you gotta micromanage Lucasfilm more now because it's clear that Kathleen Kennedy isn't doing her job properly.\\n\\nDid Disney even watch over the production of this film?  Did anyone?  How the script got green lit is baffling.\\n\\nWhat do I like about the movie?  ..................Mark Hamill's performance is really good.....it's visually stunning (which is partly why the plot holes go unnoticed by many people)..........I can't think of anything else.\\n\\nThe job of act 2 in a trilogy is to set up a hook for people to anticipate act 3.....this movie did nothing...nothing to set up the 3rd and final movie of this trilogy.","true":true}
