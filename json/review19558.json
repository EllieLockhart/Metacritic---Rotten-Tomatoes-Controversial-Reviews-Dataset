Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It takes a huge dump on established characters\\, their developments and achievements. They don't understand what the force does or is and just use it to advance the plot. Rey doesn't get an explanation for why she is a mary sue but instead gets above and beyond mary sue status\\, the entry should be renamed MaRey Sue. The First Order is an AI opponent on a video game set on very easy. They apparently are a bunch of bots waiting for the order to do basic stuff. Terrible movie\\, and the 93% critic rating is because Disney has money\\, not because the movie is any good.","true":true}
