Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Just horrible. Rey was somehow able to fight off Snoke's imperial guards\\, a force you'd expect to be extremely highly trained and kill Snoke without him noticing. This is despite her only having\\, what\\, about a week of training at the most? And don't even get me started on the Holdo maneuver.\\n\\nUgh. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay to see the movie. Well\\, besides my time. 2 1\/2 hours wasted.","true":true}
