Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi did not feel like a Star Wars movie. There was way too much humor in areas that did not need to be funny. It felt like watching another marvel movie cause of this. There was no cool or epic lightsaber duel. The movie cut around to so many different planets way to fast. It felt like the whole casino planet wasn't even necessary after the outcome of the rebel fleet. Yoda looked worse than he did in the original trilogy. Snoke was killed off without any further information on who he actually is or where he came from. I feel like there was no point to Finn and Rose's character. Phasma died too easily again. Luke was portrayed as an old hermit. Leia's display of force powers could have been done way better. It felt like a slap in the face to the previous trilogies watching this movie. UGH.","true":true}
