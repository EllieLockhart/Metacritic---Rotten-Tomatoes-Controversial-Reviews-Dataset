Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"serious WTF moments from start to finish.... threw away the lightsaber\\, really.  Luke has grew old\\, and lost his balls; the hero from the original movies was totally destroyed in this installment.  Yoda's ghost was the copy of Lion King scene with Simba & Mufasa\\, very child play.  As Snork claimed he can \\\"read Ren's mind and control it\\\"\\, he was shafted.  It was so easy\\, why it took this long for Ren to kill him.  I understand they had to make some love story out of the trilogy\\, Rey and Ren were not the likely match\\, a bit hard to swallow that one.  Overall\\, not the worst\\, but very close.","true":true}
