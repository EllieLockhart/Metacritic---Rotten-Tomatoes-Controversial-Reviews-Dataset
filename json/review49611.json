Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow that was bad. Hard to live up to the legacy but that didn't even try to fit in with the continuity of the other movies and such an awful ending. After that one\\, what is the point? Every new movie is going to keep changing everything set by the last movie; no mysteries will be answered; and clearly scrapping the bottom with plotting.","true":true}
