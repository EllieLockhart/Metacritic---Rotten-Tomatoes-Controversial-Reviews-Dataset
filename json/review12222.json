Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am glad some viewers appreciate this movie. And I understand and respect the opinion and reasoning of those who do. However\\, to me\\, this is a very disappointing movie. I'm not opposed to the addition of new characters or the departure of old ones\\, but I strongly oppose (what\\, in my opinion\\, is) a departure from the heritage and spirit of the franchise. With such a wealth of financial resources and existing source material at the disposal of the studio\\, there is simply no excuse for a choppy\\, poorly plotted film that ventures so far from previous installments.\\n\\nP. S. When did it become okay to have swearing (\\\"damn\\,\\\" \\\"bastard\\,\\\" etc.) in a Star Wars movie? One of the biggest appeals of this franchise used to be its kid- and family-friendliness.","true":true}
