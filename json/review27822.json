Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally I loved it in most ways but did find the Canto Bight sub-plot tedious and dumb. Otherwise I found it to be the best Star Wars movie since Empire (Which isn't saying much considering the competition)","true":true}
