Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went with high expectations\\, that was a mistake. There were good parts and concepts and good acting by everyone. Somehow this movie still fails.\\nNothing about Force Awakens matters\\, lots of plot holes and about 40 mins of this movie DRAGGGGGGGGGS. Its not a good movie on it's own and a terrible sequel and installment in the franchise. I can go on for hours about all the problem with just the story let alone the controversial choices. It wasn't as bad as attack of the clones but.....It was pretty disappointing on many levels. People that think the negativity has to do with fan boys being butthurt... I think you need to have some really rose colored glasses to like this movie Too many problems to get a 93%. .I made an account just to give this a low score. I think Disney must be paying\/influencing critics because there is no way this movie stands the scrutiny that starwars movies undergo over time. BAD MOVE","true":true}
