Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a Star Wars fan\\, but by no means a super fan. I enjoyed the film\\, and effects were great but I\u2019d say as a fan of the story I was left disappointed. They definitely didn\u2019t deliver what true fans wanted when it comes to Luke\\, leia and rey (her back story) and even phasma\\, I was also both shocked and disappointed with the story of snoke. Watch it and you\u2019ll see what I mean! On the positive side there were some great surprises that I really enjoyed. Roll on starwars episode 9. Hopefully jj can give the true fans more of what they crave. ","true":true}
