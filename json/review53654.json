{"101487":121653,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For anyone who hasn't seen Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, I won't drop spoilers here. I will only give my opinion and two cents. Here goes: I hated it. I don't understand Disney. You pay $4 billion dollars for Lucasfilm and decide to take a huge dump all over everything that George Lucas created and built? You expect fans to pay money to see crappy movies with poor storytelling and awful plots and throwaway characters? Why? I am going to take a swipe at the writers and the directors. As much as fans gave Lucas grief over the prequels\\, they are head and shoulders better than any of the Disney offerings. The prequels would have been so much better with better directors\\, not Lucas directing\\, in addition to writing the scripts (even though he did direct Episode IV\\, as that was the first one made and he didn't know if he would get another shot at making a movie he wanted to make and he ended up getting other directors for Episodes V and VI. The prequels felt like Star Wars\\, they had the magic\\, the \\\"it\\\" that made you believe each part belonged to the entire saga. Episodes VII and VIII...not so much\\, if at all. I liked Rogue One\\, thought it was decent\\, as it filled in and gave back story to how the Death Star plans were stolen and the power struggle within the Empire. VII\/The Force Awakens was a rehash of Episode IV\/A New Hope and it was OK\\, bordering on bad. But this new one\\, VIII\/The Last Jedi\\, was just bad. Lucas had treatments\\, if not early scripts\\, for what he envisioned for Episodes VII\/VIII\/IX\\, but Disney\/Kathleen Kennedy said nope\\, we're going in a different direction (straight down the toilet). Even Mark Hamill\\, who plays Luke Skywalker\\, had his thoughts: \\\"What I wish is that they had been more accepting of his [George Lucas'] guidance and advice. Because he had an outline for VII\\, VIII\\, and IX. And it is vastly different to what they have done.\\\" Maybe I'm in the minority\\, but the plot\\, the pacing\\, the storytelling\\, they just aren't there. Maybe I'm spoiled to how great movies used to be\\, like the Original Trilogy\\, Indiana Jones (sans The Crystal Skull\\, that was a stinker)\\, Back to the Future and other great\\, original movies from the 80s. The crap that gets released now is either poorly written or a recycle of older\\, better movies. For me\\, the Star Wars saga ended with Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. It was a great ending to a great series of films. I guess I'm getting jaded and cynical as I've gotten older\\, but there is no originality\\, no creativity\\, just a bunch of hacks given the keys to a once mighty kingdom and they are destroying the legacy and the memories many of us grew up with and cherish.","true":true}
