Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rating: B+\\n\\n\\\"All in all\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Terrific performances from the cast\\, but a flawlessly powerful display from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren steals the spotlight. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping\\, a few left me underwhelmed. The main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jaw-dropping\\, epic action sequences and excellent character-development scenes. Nevertheless\\, it departs from JJ's visual storytelling\\, delivering a more exposition-heavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down\\, largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving Finn and Rose. In the end\\, it still belongs to my top half of the saga\\, fighting for the 4th spot with Return Of The Jedi and Rogue One.\\\"","true":true}
