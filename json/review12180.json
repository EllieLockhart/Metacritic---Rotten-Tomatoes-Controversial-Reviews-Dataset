Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a published author. I have studied character creation and plot for twenty-plus years. The character arc for Luke Skywalker is horrific. Completely destroyed the character for me. Rian Johnson used Luke Skywalker as his toilet paper and flushed him down the toilet!!! \\n\\nPlease understand how painful that is to say! I LOVE STAR WARS! But\\, so many things in this movie is a disastrous mistake on many levels! I have never disliked a Star Wars movie in my life... until I saw The Last Jedi! \\n\\nPeople today do not need realistic heroes\\, falling and not getting up from failure. We see enough of that in the news! What we need are heroes who fall\\, get up and make a difference. Not heroes who hide and lose the part of themselves that makes them strong and a hero in the first place. The movie has wonderful cinematography\\, some great action scenes. But\\, I give it 1 1\/2 stars because I am just furious at Rian Johnson for thinking what he did to Luke in this film was at all acceptable! Rian ruined one of my all-time favorite heroes in all of human history!","true":true}
