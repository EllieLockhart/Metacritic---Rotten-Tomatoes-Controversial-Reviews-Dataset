Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To the crybaby fanboys using the golden age fallacy to redeem their childhoods\\, kindly stfu. This is the 8th installment of a 40 year old series\\, not the fucking sequel. It's obviously hard to keep it fresh. To refute some of the garbage critiques I've been seeing: 1.\\\"They have to Explain snoke\\\". wtf? Why? Palpatine wasn't explained until 22 years after star wars\\, in the worst trilogy. 2. \\\"Too much humor.\\\" Not even close\\, this is star wars.. not 2001 space odyssey. 3. \\\"Kylo Ren is too evil\\\"\\, makes him interesting\\, why is he so evil. 4. \\\"Luke should've battled with a light saber and not been conflicted\\\". No\\, and No. It was badass to see him manipulate the force in new ways\\, also his character needed a flaw\\, he's always been melodramatic . fit well. 5. \\\"film too liberal\\, peta\\, etc\\\". Yes hollywood is liberal\\, get over it. Arts have always been progressive. 6. \\\"Rey's parents should be Skywalkers\\\". Wtf? No. So only the Habsburgs can master the force? no. the original point of star wars is the hero's journey\\, coming up from nothing. \\n\\nIf you're too much of a curmudgeon to enjoy a fun movie\\, stay home.","true":true}
