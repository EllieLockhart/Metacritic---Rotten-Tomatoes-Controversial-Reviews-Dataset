Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie\\, although I must admit that there are some plot holes and scenes that  were not entirely necessary. In my opinion\\, most people don't like it because it was not like the script they wrote in their head and had emphasis on choosing your own path and rising out of nothing. I liked the fact that a new concept was brought to the galaxy\\, and hopefully it will be more enjoyed later on\\, as was Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
