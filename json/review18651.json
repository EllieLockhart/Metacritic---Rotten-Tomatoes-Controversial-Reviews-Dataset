Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i totally loved this movie\\, it was massively different from all the others which is why i liked it\\, there was so much to the story\\, also it was our last movie with carrie fisher\\, which made it more special\\, I can't see why people wouldn't like it\\, but i think other people live in the past\\, star wars has to grow and change i mean it's set like 40 years after the first movie\\, think of 40 years ago in our world? we didn't have mobile phones in the 70's we didn't have computers or anything\\, so of course it's going to change\\, If you look at the the phantom menice the tech on that shows they ain't as advanced as the new hope\\, now it's 40 more years ahead when the force awakens begins\\, people need to stop thinking back in time and appreciate the movie for what it is now. i loved it and i can't wait to see it again once it comes out on DVD\\, so did my partner\\, this last movie should be interesting that's for sure\\, let's hope solo a star wars story is good\\, because that rouge one was awful\\, with bad acting\\, how people could favour that over these last two i can't understand that\\, I would recommend the last jedi\\, i suggest people go watch it.","true":true}
