Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its another Star Wars movie. Nothing really of anything new that you haven't seen already. Its way too long. Many established characters go back and forth way too many times. Im not a huge Star War fan\\, but this was highly disappointing. Editing and directing seemed a bit skewed.","true":true}
