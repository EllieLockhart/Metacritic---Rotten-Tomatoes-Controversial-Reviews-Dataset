Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with a lot of these reviews that the plot lines are just everywhere. Just lacks direction and are difficult to follow. The new characters are weak. One thing that I think is being missed is that there just isn't a good bad guy. I can't believe the critics rated as high as they did. ","true":true}
