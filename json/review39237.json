Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film fails the second film in a TRILOGY to expand on what came before and provide a reason to be excited for the final act. Johnson gave RIDICULOUS amounts of screen time to characters we have no investment in. returning characters like finn do not SIGNIFICANTLY contribute to the plot. j.j abrams provided many potential plot points which were shut down in order to subvert expectations. The movie has many flaws\\, but the most severe flaw is that there is no hook for the next film. there is no good villain and no IMMEDIATE task which must be addressed. The next movie could take place 2 minutes after the end of the last jedi or 20 years after the events of the last jedi. there is nothing to keep me invested in the story\\, so i don't care what comes next.","true":true}
