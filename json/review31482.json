Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some Star Wars fans need to set their expectations to a reasonable level for future movie releases. The Last Jedi was a fantastic movie. The new trilogy is going in a different direction than the previous trilogies and it needs to so fresh stories can be told. It is unfortunate that Carrie Fisher didn\u2019t get her time to shine because she was taken from us too soon. ","true":true}
