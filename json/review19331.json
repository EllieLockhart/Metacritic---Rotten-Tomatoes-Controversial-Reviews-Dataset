Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's obvious Rian Johnson ignored what JJ Abrams set up and botched this movie. So many problems and lack of creativity. I am an avid Star Wars fan since I was a kid (I'm 41) but I hate this movie. Luke deserves better. We deserve better.","true":true}
