Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect\\, but Johnson takes the reigns on the second entry of the new Star Wars trilogy and fulfills so much. His story is the most clear and original and every character gets great arcs.\\n\\nMost importantly this entry into the franchise has some of the best fight scenes ever to grace the screens in the Star Wars Cinematic Universe. It gives fans everything a Star Wars movie should have including new planets\\, new and interesting characters\\, and delightful direction. \\n\\nDespite what others may say about this film it is simply the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back and that's period.","true":true}
