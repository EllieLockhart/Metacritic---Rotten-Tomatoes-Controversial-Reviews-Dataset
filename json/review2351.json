Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ATTENTION PLEASE: Disney's damage control shills in action!\\n\\nSince the Last Jedi's release for digital download\\, Disney's shills are inundating Rottentomatoes and other critic review sites with OBVIOUSLY FAKE positive reviews of this abomination of a movie.\\nIf you browse through the last 5 or 6 weeks\\, you will only see 1 positive review every 10-15 negative ones.\\nNow\\, all of a sudden\\, tens of positive reviews are flooding the site.\\n\\nTHIS IS DAMAGE CONTROL !!!
