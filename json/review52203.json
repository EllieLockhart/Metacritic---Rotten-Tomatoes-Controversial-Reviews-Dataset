{"101487":100099,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-01","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this film\\, I only know one truth. It is time for Star Wars to end. The Force Awakens itself attracted little attention from me\\, seeming like the film was only intended to set the scene to continue the films and profit a bit more rather than add anything new. I expected much better from The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe plot was supposed to thicken in this film. Instead\\, there is no real plot development. Apart from some major characters killed off unnecessarily and with little struggle\\, the film does not seem to leave the story in any different place than it was at the beginning and fails to generate much interest in what might happen next. There were surprises\\, but they were really just anti-climaxes\\, something we don't normally expect of Star Wars. I found them comical to a large extent\\, but I really don't care what happens next or think much about what I just saw. That is much different from the way most of the previous films left me feeling.\\n\\nI give this film a low rating because I feel Star Wars must end. It is becoming strained fanfiction based on awkward attempts to connect random new characters like Rey with old characters like Yoda (his ghost apparently approve of her and is a fan). Those strained references are like the stretched\\, warped reviews this film has received by people desperate (or perhaps bribed) to publicly praise Disney's cash cow.","true":true}
