Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was born a month before Star Wars came out in 1977.  I literally have no concept of life without it.  Every birthday and Christmas present until I was 8 or 10 pretty much consisted of Kenner figures and vehicles.  My blanket became Hoth and my back yard served double duty as both Endor and Dagobah.  I'm sure Rian Johnson was like the rest of us and spent hours dreaming up new adventures for our heroes after Return of the Jedi.  And even though I never imagined this story\\, it was just perfect.  Easily my favorite Star Wars film after Empire.  My only regret is that we couldn't have had an extra trilogy  of films set somewhere halfway between Jedi and TFA.   But Luke really completed his hero's journey in Jedi.  These films are squarely about the next generation and I'm loving every minute.","true":true}
