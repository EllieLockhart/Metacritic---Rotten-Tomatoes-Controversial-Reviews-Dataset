Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes galore. Can tell this was written with no regard for what came before. Instead of progressing characters many regress (ie. luke). TFA was good in comparison for all its flaws and lack of innovation. Rehashed ideas are better then nonsensical ones. Some brilliant looking scenes but cant make up for the hollow feeling the writing leaves you with. Seems it was made for children\/millenials rather then SW fans. Lucus should be allowed to fix their mistakes in final draft so the cannon and worldbuilding doesnt suffer like this in future films. Their best asset and they ignore his input.  ","true":true}
