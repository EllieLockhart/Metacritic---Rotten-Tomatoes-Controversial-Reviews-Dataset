Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie to say the least. The Last Jedi has an intoxicating number of Bathos jokes that ruin characters such as Hux. This movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to benefit from nostalgia or a new Star Wars style\\, therefore it ended up killing off the nostalgic elements in preparation for the new. This absolutely did not feel like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
