Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My Humble Theories....\\n\\nWell.... Where to begin - the 'fan'atical hatred for this episode\\, the questionable 4\/5 star reviews\\, plot holes\\, lack of character development \/ arcs \/ jarring behaviour\\, coincidences\\, running time etc\\, etc\\, ETC \\nSo much to choose from. it would seem.\\n\\nA life long fan of the Original Trilogy (yes\\, afraid I'm one of those \\\"I was there at the beginning\\, you don't know how good it was!\\\" *Spaced Ref*)\\, which I freely admit have some questionable moments\\, but seemingly not so many. \\nI've decided rather than regurgitate those much discussed elements to offer some theories as to the thinking behind these decisions.\\n\\nFirstly I believe a 'new direction' was needed\\, many people complained The Force Awakens was a retread of Episode IV or a Star Wars Greatest Hits compilation\\, but The Last Jedi seems to have had no end of the same accusations as well\\, some of the people - some of the time.\\n\\nDefying Expectations - As we now live in an interconnected world\\, where for the last 2 years virtually every conceivable idea has been debated over endlessly by 'The Fandom Menace'. It must be increasingly difficult for Writers & Directors to make a film (especially a Star Wars film) that entertains\\, surprises and meets expectations. So perhaps being an almost impossible task\\, Rian Johnson decided to defy expectations\\, just look at his CV and style of filmmaking.\\n\\nMythology Verses Reality \/ Child verses Adult POV - while we'd prefer more logic and believability\\, these are after all fantasy films\\, so a suspension of disbelieve is required\\, which is easier for a 10 year old than\\, say a *cough* 40+ year old. Note-obviously I don't know the age spectrum of the disgruntled fans\\, so this is all theoretical.\\nAs the characters have to face some hard truths\\, so too do the adult audience - heroes are not always immortal\\, people do change over time\\, not necessarily for the better and they do make mistakes which inevitably have repercussions.\\nPossibly Rian and Disney are trying to tell the old guard (people who were kids at the time of the Original Trilogy) it's time to move on....\\nThese films are for children\\, that shouldn't mean OT fans are not considered as important by the corporation\\, but they are probably thinking of the long game.\\nShow Business is a money making endeavour primarily and it's doubtful Disney bought Star Wars because they were interested in furthering the storyline\\, completing the original character arcs or building the mythology.\\n\\nThe fact is this franchise has a built in audience spanning 40 years with an unquenchable curiosity\\, stratospheric expectations and an overwhelming desire to be entertained.\\n\\nAnd I imagine shall continue for A Long Time To Go\\, In A Galaxy Far\\, Far Away....","true":true}
