Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an undervalued and underappreciated gem in the Star Wars saga. It's very clear from audience reviews that many people aren't very good at allowing their beloved franchise to go in the direction that its creators want\\, instead clinging to their own ideas of what Star Wars is\\, creating impossible expectations that can never bet met and an outcry which as we saw from The Rise of Skywalker\\, leads to stagnation and the directors not trying anything new. Giving us lacklustre and hollow movies.\\n\\nMake no mistake about it. The Last Jedi is a fantastic movie. Both as a Star Wars movie and as an individual piece of science fiction. One just needs to allow the story to unfold and let the events on screen  unfold before their eyes and leave their expectations and predetermined notions of what Star Wars is at the door.","true":true}
