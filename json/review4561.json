{"101487":113364,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly critics are being paid here...\\n\\nThis movie is an absolute plot hole-ridden disaster. While the Force Awakens may not have been perfect\\, it set up the characters that we're supposed to be built upon in this trilogy. Rian Johnson effectively dodges trying to build anything on these characters and basically recreates them how he sees fit.\\n\\n**SPOILERS**\\n\\nHere's just some of the MASSIVE problems in this film:\\n\\n1. Snoke - Want to know more about Snoke? Who he is? Where he comes from? How he became so powerful with the Force? How is he tied to the Emperor and the Sith? How did he come to meet and seduce Ben\/Kylo? Well\\, forget it\\, he's dead with no explanation.\\n\\n2. The Space Chase - The entire movie revolves around the slowest space chase in history. Why doesn't the FIRST ORDER just send literally one of the Star Destroyers into a .000001 sec lightspace jump ahead of the Resistance to cut them off? Chase over.\\n\\n3. The \\\"Vegas\\\" Planet Sub-Plot - This entire segment of the movie with Finn and new Jar-Jaresque character\\, Rose\\, could've been entirely cut out of the movie and it wouldn't have changed a single thing. This whole section was used as a political soap-box to discuss animal rights\\, war profiteering\\, and hating the rich.\\n\\n4. Rey the Jedi Master - She basically trains herself in a matter of weeks as Luke is too grumpy and sad to really do much tutoring. She becomes so insanely strong with the Force in such a short time that's it laughable.\\n\\n5. Luke; Poor\\, poor\\, Luke - I see why Mark Hamill bashed the movie and the direction they went in interviews. What they did to the character of Luke is a downright travesty. He sulks around for almost the entire movie just to \\\"Force Project\\\" himself in the last part of the movie to \\\"face\\\" Kylo Ren\\, setting it up that he's so powerful he can do that and will live to face him in the final movie. But\\, this entire point is wasted as\\, \\\"for reasons we cannot understand\\, he dies\\\" (almost broken heart Padme style from Revenge of the Sith\\, which went over so well with the fans).\\n\\nWhat they SHOULD have done if the intent was to kill Luke\\, is to have him show up\\, be the badass Jedi Master we've all been waiting to see for 30 years\\, and Force-crush the walker army\\, and sacrifices himself to Kylo Obi-Wan style\\, still becoming one with the Force in the end to help Rey down the road.\\n\\n6. The Vacuum of Space... Or not - Several times in this movie they completely ignore how space works. From pretending there is resistance to traveling in the void of space in a ship\\, to several characters being without a mask in open space like it's just not there.\\n\\nWasted Characters - Finn takes a back seat in this with a horrid sub-plot as I said before\\, but that's not all\\, Maz show's back up in one of the most forced \\\"cameo's\\\" ever seen. Blue-Glowie Yoda was neat\\, but also felt forced in.\\n\\n7. The Jokes On Us - Right from the start\\, Rian makes a choice to throw in some of the lamest\\, slap-stick humor we've seen in a Star Wars movie. Hux essentially plays a Troll's game of 'Telephone' with Poe leading into a \\\"Your Mom\\\" joke (yep\\, really) that immediately had me shaking my head saying\\, \\\"What the hell is happening...?\\\"\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie was a MASSIVE disappointment and a huge waste of potential for so many cool characters introduced to us in the Force Awakens. Just a mess all-around and I fear for what will happen now that Rian has his own trilogy coming...","true":true}
