Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it start to finish. A step up from episode 7 which lacked originality. This stays loyal to the franchise while expanding the storyline and finally explaining the force. I don't understand all the negative reviews. It's like they saw a different movie or just want to be nitpicky. Enjoy the movie for what it is\\, not what you think it should be. See it on the big screen.","true":true}
