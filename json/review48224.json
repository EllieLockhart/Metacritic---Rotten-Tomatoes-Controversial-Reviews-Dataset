{"101487":196935,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who says that studios can't buy reviews!? 46% audience vs. 91% critics... hmm. If the critic review is honest then I can only think that they were blinded by the visuals because everything else here is so deeply flawed. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson share equal blame for this terrible movie but both have instead decided to blame the fans.\\n\\nA lot of positive reviews for a bad Star Wars film will always tend towards the \\\"just enjoy the movie for what it is\\\" but this argument does not hold water for the second act in a trilogy and part of an ongoing saga - it has to be held in context with the others. Regardless\\, the fundamental problems in TLJ come down to basic story-telling and poor decisions by the development team\\, the problems are wide ranging but the largest failures stem from a clear decision that plot momentum and 'themes' take precedence over character\\, story or logic. What is more painful however is that it is so ridiculously tone deaf throughout\\, attempting to shove humor into what should be sombre or tense moments. We learn nothing new or more compelling about the characters that Disney-Lucasfilm is so desperately trying to paint as heroes whilst what remains of the older beloved characters - thrown in clearly for fan service - are so tragically wasted leaving the passing movie-goer confused and the Star Wars fans completely despondent.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead....\\n\\nFan favorites like Akbar\\, Luke\\, and Chewbacca (demoted once again to a taxi driver) are sidetracked for characters with no personality or likability - admiral Holdo I'm looking at you! And the problems seem to stem not from the actors but from the writing of these characters. Fisher\\, Hamill\\, Gleeson\\, amd Isaac all make reasonable work of what they have but it is just badly composed dialog. \\nHoldo is a prime example\\, she is simply not believable as a strong leader and commander of the republic like Leia\\, she is needlessly snarky\\, belittling to her fleet commander\\, unlikable\\, untrusting and untrustworthy to her compatriots. The interaction between Poe and Holdo on Poe's recklessness - despite the bombers doing exactly what they were supposed to do ( and badly designed for ) is ridiculous and serves only to create a false conflict with one of the few characters that has actually proven himself in the sequels. Surely she's a double agent?. No? Just an very very bad admiral? Oh. The eventual end of this irritating character does not stand as any 'heroic sacrifice' but a welcome relief to be rid of her. The interchange between these characters stinks of Kennedy's recent input into the series.\\n\\nIt feels as though the director has made a conscious decision to cast aside all of the plot threads that were left by the prequel - which\\, whilst being far from perfect left numerous interesting options to explore....\\n- Who is the all-powerful Supreme Leader Snoke? ... It doesn't matter\\n- Finn's horrific back injury from Kylo in TFA? ... nothing to see here \\n- Who are Rey's parents and why is she so powerful? ... She's nobody\\, and she is just amazing at everything. Live with it. \\n- The appearance of Luke's lightsaber\\, \\\"a good story\\, for another time\\\"... apparently not this time.\\n- How will the First Order wrestle power from the New Republic? ... Title-crawl says it is so.\\n- Why was Luke on that planet and what's with the hidden map? ... he's just a grumpy old sod who likes his privacy now because... reasons.\\n- Why has Ben gone over to the dark side and what is his relationship to Snoke? Where are the knights of Ren? How will Snoke \\\"complete his training\\\"? ...Well\\, those are just silly questions! \\n\\nIf the writer-director Rian Johnson had explored any one of these threads we might have had a more compelling story than this wreck. Instead we get the worlds slowest car chase as the movie skips between scenes that should be packed with tension and emotion and chops them up so catastrophically that the audience cannot feel anything for or with these people. Taking just one example\\, at the moment that Luke hears that Han is dead Rian Johnson decides to cut to another scene! Why !? This is a character that the audience cares about and has invested 3 films and decades of Star Wars canon learning that his best friend and ally is dead at the hands of his pupil. Such a bad decision in terms of storytelling and engaging your audience\\, and indicative of the entire film. \\n\\nThere is very little sentiment here for the audience to become engaged in\\, no logical progression of cause and effect and no respect for the physics laid down in the rest of the universe. They are all sacrificed for the sake of plot movement and as a consequence grate against all of the other movies. \\n\\nThe problem that I and many other people have with this movie is that the universe is already built\\, this is a sequel to the original trilogy and the audience expects that the rules of that universe are to be followed. Why the ships and weapons and lightspeed operate in a certain way has already been established\\, this movie pulls the rug from all of them and subsequently undermine the physics set up in the universe....\\n- Turboblasters on a dreadnought cannot destroy a fighter because it's too small\\, erm  when has that ever been an issue\\, and why then are the even smaller tie fighters in danger from the cannons on the Raddus !?\\n- Bombers despite 30 years of development are less developed than the old Y-wings\\, don't have shields and have to be directly above the target\\, for some reason \\n- A single fighter can take out a dreadnought by jumping into light-speed!? eh? why was this not done with the Death Star(s) !?\\, I'm sure you could find volunteers\\, or auto-pilot a ship to do this on every occasion you are confronted with a star destroyer !!?\\n- Star destroyers can't catch the rebels at sub-light speed\\, all of their various sizes of cruisers are in-fact exactly matching in speed...\\, but nor can they or jump ahead of them\\, or send their disposable fighters\\, or call for backup to cut them off\\, or any one of the countless other solutions to a problem that exists entirely for this awful plot.\\n- Everyone has the force and nobody's special. Definitely not the Jedi.\\n- The force allows you to survive (and fly !! ) in space (i giggled on the mary poppins scene but heard people laughing out loud in the cinema\\, and don't think about how the rebels are opening the airlocked door either). \\n- force ghosts can now create physical lightning... seriously\\, what ?!\\n\\nThe most jarring for me is the depiction of Luke\\, although Mark Hamill is doing his best with a bad script it is clear that he like many of us felt this a complete 180 of Luke Skywalker's fundamental personality - a man that would never give up\\, that saw the good in everyone\\, that stood for hope and building something better is completely missing in whatever Rian Johnson thinks this character is. I would say that probably the only moment in the movie that actually hits tonally is a poignant moment where Luke sits in the Falcon in a moment of reflection without saying a word Hamill provides a glimpse of what could have been.\\n\\nThe thousands of comments left by reviewers concerning Rey's Mary Sue (seemingly perfect fictional character usually but not always female #feminism) analogy continue to be valid. Crack pilot and engineer? check. Fluent in Wookie in no time flat ? Check. Swim like a fish despite growing up on a desert planet? Pah simple! Master swordsmanship by standing up against the Elite Praetorian Guard and Luke friking Skywalker? why this is easy for her; she is Super-Jesus ! Even in this movie during her supposed training nothing is earned or struggled for\\, and as a result she again comes of as completely un-relatable hero who is never in any real danger. \\n\\nWith the death of Luke and Snoke Rey is now seemingly the most powerful force user in the galaxy and she has earned none of it! The audience might accept this if she had some powerful force-sensitive family\\, but nope\\, we're told that genealogy means nothing in the new Star Wars\\, and apparently hard work and graft is just for old people.\\n\\nThere is a painfully drawn-out\\, conveniently set-up and ultimately pointless excursion to Canto-bite for Finn and a non-character Rose whereupon Rian Johnson will heavy hand the concept that people that profit from war=bad and our gallant moral compasses will chance upon a codebreaker before trashing the place in what is surely a prequel to lots of cleanup work and whipping of the human slaves that work there; then we are told that it's all worth it when they release the animals 10 minutes away from the stables and we conveniently (and thankfully) fly out with the codebreaker. This pointless aside renders any re-watching of this film a skip-start-skip affair and appears to be simply a mechanism to get finn onto a star destroyer to have a logic-defying showdown with Phasma (bb8 somehow saves the day in an at-st and they escape... i don't know how that happens). \\n\\nI wonder whether such a heavy handed political message as canto-bite that is so hugely off-point from the main story would have been so easily overlooked by critics in another movie.? \\n\\nThe villains are wasted even further in this film through slapdash writing\\, how can we be expected to take the First Order seriously when there are no competent leaders? From the first scene where Hux is being \\\"tooled\\\"\\, it is such as mis-step in tone as from that stage on there is no threat\\, no real menace to be overcome. They're fools\\, and to win you just have to be less foolish than the First Order. Phasma\\, Snoke and Hux all had potential to be great villains but they were entirely stupified and wasted in this film\\, there is no sense of danger from any of these morons once Snoke is dead. The Tarkin-esque foil to Ren we may have been hoping for never comes and instead he is reduced to a buffoon baddie bit part. Adam Driver plays a believable Kylo Ren but there are no competent commanders on either side and subsequently any victories by the resistance are shallower as a result\\, Was there any doubt in anyone's mind that finn would be victorious once Phasma didn't kill them like any competent commander would 'because she wanted it to hurt'. .. sigh! Don't put characters in those situations unless you plan to back it up Rian !!! \\n\\nFurthermore\\, not only is it extremely poorly written new material. It steals openly and badly from other star wars under the guise of something new. The hermit teacher\\, the Emperors throne room\\, the red guards\\, the walkers attacking the base\\, the lando-like betrayal to the empire\\, Rey's conversations to Kylo are lifted from lukes with Vader and many more besides... only far far worse than the original.\\n\\nI will concede that visually this is a very good looking movie however it is a sad state of affairs that I would argue that prequels are actually superior to TLJ in countless ways from basic story telling\\, character development\\, set-up\/reward and feeling like we are continuing a saga - think of how many new and exciting things were introduced in the prequels\\, Lucas took painstaking detail into all of it\\, sure some miss-fires but was world building in all of them and you felt like like he cared about the universe walking away from each of them with something positive\\, not feeling cheated. This movie however fails in all of those aspects\\, it does not world build in it's plagiarism\\, it is aggressively commercial and does not stand up as a solid movie on it's own. \\nDespite the sluggishness of the prequels the politics set the story and the universe - we understood why the emperor rose to power and why Anakin stood with him. Here in TLJ nothing is earned and the director simply gets the pieces on the board as he wants them. Somehow the First Order is now as powerful as the Empire and the New Republic are now the rebels. There is no explanation to any of this\\, we just have to accept it and the story (or rather the plot) bumbles along bouncing off whatever obstacles are placed in its way until the showdown on (not) Hoth (no\\, its definitely not\\, they tell us\\,.. it's salt. Genius!) whereupon we all cringe at the most monumentally stupid \\\"save the thing you love\\\" moment (how did rose not kill finn by crashing into him !?)\\, Fin magically survives this however and makes it back to the base despite being right in-front of the walkers\\, Luke's assassination at the hands of the movie is completed and Rey of course saves the day without too many problems at all for her. \\n\\nSo\\, the circle is complete ahead of it's time. Our heroes are dead\\, the main antagonist  is dead and where do we go from here? Does anyone care? I won't be so dramatic as to say that this movie has killed Star Wars for Star Wars fans\\, Disney of course has dozens of stories in the pipeline but as far as I can see this trilogy is now a lost cause. The excitement\\, anticipation and HOPE is simply not present at the end of TLJ\\, it leaves you frustrated and cold and does not entice you to watch more nor wonder what will become of these characters - we simply don't care about them because of the choices made in the script. Do I care to watch the obvious Rey & Finn love story unfold when there has been no chemistry between them thusfar? or see Kylo Ren battle with his inner daemons through the occasional tantrum? Another pointless cameo by Maz Kanata? Rose was dragged back to the base\\, surely we want to see that she's still alive? Not really\\, no. \\n\\nAll in all it's just an infuriating affair\\, with mis-judged placement of humour\\, painfully obvious personal ideologies and very boring\\, very lazy and very bad writing at every stage by Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy... and well\\, 91% it most certainly is not.\\n\\noh\\, and porgs.","true":true}
