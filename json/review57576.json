Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This whole movie just makes no sense. \\nIf I were to write a proper review\\, it would be longer than the length of a PHD dissertation to dissect this movie into everything that is wrong with it\\,  But here are some of the major points.\\nLuke Skywalker(You know\\, THE MAN THAT MADE STAR WARS) contradicts the entirety of what his character originally represents\\, Hope. Rian Johnson hates strong male characters\\, so lets turn Luke into a regressed old man who secluded himself from the galaxy BUT gave the galaxy a map of where to find him if they needed help. WTF?\\n\\nRose Tico is worst than Jar Jar Binks. She is by far one of the most useless and worst written characters I have ever seen. She contributes literally nothing to the movie and if she was removed\\, the movie wouldn't change at all. Yet half of the movie has an Arc with HER. The romance between her & Finn..... The worst romance plot I have ever seen.\\n\\nAdmiral Anti-men feminist Holdo\\, or whatever is the worst military commander ever shown on screen. A NORMAL officer would inform their subordinates of their plans for survival to instill hope in the crew\\, BUT SCREW THAT. LETS CAUSE A MUTINY BECAUSE THERE'S LITERALLY NO PLAN. <-- Half of the movie.\\n\\nRey is the most perfect character in the entire cinema universe. She has no faults and is perfect at everything she does. She beats Luke after sparring with a ROCK. She is on par with Kylo\\, despite literally 2 lessons with Luke\\, and sparring with a ROCK. She beats all of those elite red guard guys after 2 lessons and a ROCK. She mastered the Force\\, literally out of nowhere. Just declare her grand master already\\, what the hell are you waiting for Kathleen Kennedy?!\\n\\nBut hey\\, the VFX looked cool.","true":true}
