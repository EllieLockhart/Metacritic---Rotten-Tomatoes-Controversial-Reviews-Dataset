Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2nd worst movie of the franchise (worst is Episode I with that idiot Jar Jar Binks).\\n\\nThis movie lacked heart and soul something even Episodes II and III managed to find.\\n\\nThis movie did not pay homage to the Skywalker family and \\\"SPOILER ALERT\\\"\\n\\n\\nLuke deserved a better ending. HAMILL deserved a better ending.\\n\\nPithy\\, pedestrian\\, left me wanting my $$$ and time spent watching the drivel back.","true":true}
