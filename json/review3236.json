Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful movie\\, beautiful scenery\\, not half bad acting and it was nice to see a solid mix of puppet\\, animatronics\\, and cgi... but the writing\\, execution\\, and pacing was so atrocious that the bad outweighs the good. Rian is a good director\\, but please don't let him write anything else in the saga\\, his story telling sucks.","true":true}
