Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took everything that was being set up in episode 7 and threw it away. A lot attempts of humor were out of place and made no sense. From the opening scene\\, the First order should have just blasted Poe instead of the comedy bit. Luke tossing the lightsaber. I could go on. There was no character development too many new characters that weren't needed\\, instead we went on missions that didn't matter. The movie was not only terrible as a stand alone but terrible as part of a series.","true":true}
