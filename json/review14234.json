Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give one star for all the amazing production. The rest i hate it\\, I cant sense any of Jedi emotional going in here. The lightsaber scene sucks\\, it supposed to feel like someone swinging it must have some form of martial art\\, in this movie it feel like normal people swing the stick around with no style. \\n\\nI hate all the obvious drama happening in this movie\\, i dont feel any chemical. I hate how they trying to make Snoke scene look too convincing that hes dead for sure (even if most critics know something is going on)\\, so my point would be\\, if u just make it a little bit more obvious\\, i think fans would be more interesting in the why than feeling WTF is going on here. But thats how they going with it\\, they want ppl to feel WTF. So this is what you get.","true":true}
