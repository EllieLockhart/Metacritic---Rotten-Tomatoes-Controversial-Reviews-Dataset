The graphics are simply stunning\\, the lighting effects\\, body movements and facial expressions are some of the best on PS4. I'm a huge fan of survival horror and I really hope that Until Dawn sets the bar high for the rest of next gen survival horror games. I'm sure some will not like the interactive movie format but if you love horror movies and\/or horror games you have must pick up this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
