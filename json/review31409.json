Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the answers to the questions you had in The Force Awakens will be answered in a way you won't like the rest will be just thrown away and as not important after telling spending an entire film telling you they were. The main conflict is a 2.5 hr slow chase scene that should have been resolved in 20 minutes. Character choices were at times strange and served as a way to extend the film than anything meaningful. There are great moments but most of them are sabatoged immediately after leaving you wondering why they did them at all. There will be times where you feel as if someone snuck deleted scenes from the prequel trilogy in the second act of film with the amount of CG. Overall it's a disappointing movie with moments of awe but left lacking in substance that takes the excitement from wanting to see the last movie in the trilliogy. ","true":true}
