Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Astonishing visuals\\, great special effects\\, decent acting from Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley. The movie had some nice moments like the binary sunset scene\\, yoda's appearance and SOME of the lines of dialogue were on point. Rest of it? Utter garbage (the plot is boring and filled with plotholes). Overrall\\, it didnt felt like Star Wars. The prequels were  better in comparison (at least those had the star wars feel). Not going to watch episode IX since the whole new trilogy is now a mess\\, also\\, i think that the soundstrack was very uninspired \\, specially when you compare it to john williams previous work for the prequels and OT. \\n\\nDont care about any future Disney Star Wars releases. These movies are insulting.","true":true}
