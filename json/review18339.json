Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this Star Wars was going to be the Grandaddy of them all... boy was it a let down. If your a star wars fan\\, I'd still waste money on seeing it simply because it's freaking star wars. However\\, if your a casual fan of the saga\\, wait till Blu-ray","true":true}
