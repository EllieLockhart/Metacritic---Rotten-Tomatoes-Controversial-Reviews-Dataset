Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie stands alone in the trilogy. The force awakens was created to introduce us to the new plot and left the ending open to lead us into something great. Rian Johnson essentially threw out everything that the first movie did\\, created pointless side stories that eventually meant nothing\\, created characters that made no sense and at the end of the movie they did nothing to further the story and killed off everything that left us hanging in the first movie. In a nut shell\\, it is a go no where movie that explains nothing\\, does not further the plot\\, and just throws in a bunch of action scenes with no climax. It jumps around a lot and does not explain anything and makes no plot setup for the next movie. Disney would be better off re-writing the entire movie in a way that actually makes sense. Not only is it a bad Star Wars movie\\, it just a poorly written go nowhere movie full of sarcasm in a serious universe. Bottom line\\, if it didn't have the Star Wars name it would have went down in the books as a complete failure.","true":true}
