Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- Felt like a marvel movie \\n- everything you had questions about in the first movie doesnt get answer or is just stupid why set up things in first one to ignore it in second one\\n- sjw casino scene was terrible\\n- apparently rian started writing this movie before even seeing the first one\\n- good movie ...maybe? but if you came for star wars youll probably be disappointed \\nwasnt star wars ...if they made the force awaken like this one id proabbly except it more but the direction from force awaken is so different from this one. dont care about 9 at all atm done buying books","true":true}
