Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"why? why? why? star wars does memes and cheeky nandos. some really great bits. some utter dog eggs. \\\"holding....still holding....\\\" Poe talks to the The First Order call center? weird. a \\\"ye mam\\\" joke? come on lads. I hated Brick too so hating this made sense I guess.\\ni get a 42 year old lifetime fan of star wars 4 to 6 is not Disneys key audience here so more the fool me for caring I guess?","true":true}
