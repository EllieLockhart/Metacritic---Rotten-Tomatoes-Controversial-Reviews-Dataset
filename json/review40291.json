Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't the worst movie by any means but a stand needs to be made. The actors looked like the tried but clearly you had actors not particularly happy with the writing\\, directors and executives obviously wanting different things and a story that is just convoluted and pointless. Clearly trying to tap into the marvel market by pushing out movies as quick as they can they've lost the magic that made star wars great. The worst thing is not only does this alienate the old school neck beards but it isn't even particularly fun for kids like the phantom menace was. A real mess and Disney needs to radically rethink and perhaps halt production until they get everyone moving in the same direction to make a cohesive movie","true":true}
