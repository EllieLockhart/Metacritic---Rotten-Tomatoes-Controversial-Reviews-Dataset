Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They ruined Luke's character - he just wasn't Luke - period.  Mark Hamill told them they were wrong and they should have listened.  Rey was our best new character from the series and they've cheapened her story by leaving out any possible opportunity for character development in this movie.  Instead they introduce Rose\\, the new Jar-Jar Binks\\, to take a trip back to prequel-land in Vegas and waste a half hour of another great new character's time.  Meanwhile some lady from the Hunger Games is wasting the other half of the movie in a low-speed\\, super boring and pointless chase scene.  JJ Abrams set this guy up so perfectly to make an awesome movie - so many cool new characters\\, interesting mysteries to be answered.  All of that was either glossed over\\, left completely unaddressed\\, or resolved in some lame jokey way.  In an interview with this director in Rolling Stone\\, he said when he got the job someone gave him a model Millenium Falcon.  The first thing he did was threw it across the room to see if it would fly.  Of course\\, it broke.  That's this movie.","true":true}
