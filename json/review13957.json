{"101487":132548,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't think too deeply about the plot\\, characterizations\\, and all the foundation laid down in the previous 8 Star Wars movies and cartoons\\, then you could ay this it is an enjoyable roller coaster ride and 5 stars.\\n\\nHowever if you are a critically thinking Star Wars fan\\, then you may well be aware of the following issues and why 3 or even 2 stars is a generous rating due to continuity problems and sloppy writing. {Spoilers ahead}.\\n\\n1. If the First Order is sizeable enough to do mop up operations across the galaxy as said in the opening crawl\\, they lacked a second fleet to basically intercept and pincer move a weak resistance fleet. \\n\\n2. In TFA they introduced force powers that could freeze a laser beam in mid air while slso engaging in force choking and other force acts. Yet\\, Leia could not freeze the shot going to the bridge thereby saving Ackbar and the rest and Snoke could not bend the blade of the saber before suffering a mortal wound. \\n\\n3. Why is the Last Jedi more concerned\\, in terms of movie run time\\, with finding a code breaker to end this slow speed chase than\\, oh I don't know...explaining force sensitivity and being a Jedi with more than one line \\\"Jedi's don't own the force\\\"? \\n\\n4. Where is the Knights of Ren in this movie\\, even in the flashbacks of the destruction of the Jedi Temple\\, since they were supposedly there according to TFA? I had to look up after the movie just to make sure the Praetorian Guard was not the Knights of Ren in better outfits. \\n\\n5. I expected Luke or Yoda to at least explain the existence of Snoke or at least make reference to the Sith rule of two being another bit of hubris or lies the Jedi bought into. Considering the simultaneous existence of Maul\\, Dooku\\, and Grevious\\, as well as Vader\\, the Inquisitors\\, and Spider Maul\\,  as well as the era with Snoke\\, Kylo\\, and the rest of the Knights of Ren\\, the rule of two for Sith is not even a suggestion for Lucas\\, never mind Disney.\\n\\n6. If Darth Maul could survive being chopped in half according to Star Wars canon\\, a) why was Kylo not aware of that?  b) how weak is Snoke that a Sith apprentice could survive what a master could not?\\n\\n7. If Luke was so convinced he could turn his father back to the light after the death of millions at his hand\\, why was he so convinced of his inability to turn a dark leaning apprentice back to the light\\, who did nothing really bad at that point\\, but instead need to murder him by light saber rather than force choking in his sleep or focusing on turning him back\\, like he did with his more powerful Daddy? Is it an old Jedi adage that you can't turn back your own fallen apprentice that's at play here?\\n\\n8. If Luke was going to help the resistance\/Rebels\\, why didn't he hitch a ride in the Falcon and do his force projection at closer less straining range\\, so it might not kill him?\\n\\n9. Why would the rebels engineer a base with no known back door and why couldn't Leia or Kylo sense it but Luke and the crystal foxes could?\\n\\n10.  If Hordo was such a good general\\, why not take one of the first cruisers and smash it into the First Order fleet at light speed and preserve the the rest of your fleet?\\n\\n11. Unless Rose is the last Jedi\\, why was more run time devoted to her plot than IDK than Luke or Rey\\, since either of them technically may be considered the last Jedi?\\n\\nThis just points to some sloppy ass writing and poor continuity checks. If Disney still has Riann Johnson write the next trilogy\\, I will be skipping those if they are poorly plotted as this film.","true":true}
