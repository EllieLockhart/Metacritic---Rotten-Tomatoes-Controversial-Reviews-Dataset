Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So this is odd\\, the critics love it\\, but many of the the \u201cfans\u201d hate it\\, with all the vitriol that only a social media trolling campaign can generate. Personally\\, as a rabid devourer of all things sci-fi for the last 40 years\\, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Brilliant classic SW\\, reborn and reimagined. Don\u2019t believe the nonsense about it being worse than the soul-sapping phantom menace - the two are not in any way comparable. Compelling\\, engaging\\, surprising and a whole lot of fun.","true":true}
