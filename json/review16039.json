Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I mainly watch these for the light saber fight scenes...this lacked those scenes. One of plot lines seemed almost pointless as well\\, like if we took it out no one would have been able to tell the difference. As for the overall story\\, I struggled to sit through this one","true":true}
