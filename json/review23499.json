Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie\\, thought it was a great story-line keeping to a successful formula for Star Wars of the good side not always being as victorious as you would hope\\, but enough to make progress against the evil.","true":true}
