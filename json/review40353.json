Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably my favorite Star Wars film yet. One of Rian Johnson's strengths here is he was able to elevate the characters of the film to a whole new level. He analyzes everyone's faults\\, and has the characters grow. Many films do this\\, obviously\\, but what makes this film special is that it subverts practically every theory that has come about the characters. You will be surprised. Kylo Ren and Luke in particular were my favorites of this film\\, and I think Rian Johnson elevated them to levels I did not expect they could be.\\n\\nThe film definitely has faults\\, however\\, particularly a subplot of the film that took place in a rather boring location. Despite all that\\, I don't think the film deserves the hate it has gotten\\, nor the proclamations of how it \\\"ruined Star Wars.\\\" 4.5\/5 for me.","true":true}
