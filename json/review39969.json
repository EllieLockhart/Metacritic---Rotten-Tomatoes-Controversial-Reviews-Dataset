Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is hands down the best Star Wars movie yet - and if you\\, like me\\, was a little disappointed with The Force Awakens' lack of originality and creative spark\\, well\\, Rian Johnson has made a movie that never seems to run out of surprises.","true":true}
