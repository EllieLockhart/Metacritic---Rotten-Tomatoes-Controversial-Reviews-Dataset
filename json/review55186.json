Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish it didn't but I think this movie kinda sucks.\\nI LOVED episode VII\\, it's my tied favourite with IV. But this one I'd rank pretty close to Phantom Menace. Porg things looked dumb and besides the scene with Chewie by the campfire they felt like they were shoved in for cheap laughs. There was a bunch of jokes that belonged in an Adam Sandler movie. Scenes just didn't make sense like the stupid waste of five minute mirror stuff. The whole \\\"Good VS Light & Balance\\\" theme was WAAY less elegant than what JJ did with it. In fact it seemed like wherever VII was subtle or nuanced this film was like wham\\, look at this. Look at the 2 Yoda scenes for instance. It frustrates the crap outta me that I've written all of this and can keep going.\\n\\nPositives are that the first 5 minutes were badass and puppet Yoda looked fantastic.\\n\\nMy main gripe is that Luke just didn't feel or act like Luke.","true":true}
