Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A single opinion filled with spoiler. The treatment of Luke's character left me flat and quite frankly pretty miserable. Narrative of the movie is spent building up the return of Luke after his failure with his Nephew. To a degree he does return\\, to the point it even looks like the character will perform powerful feats show in books and comics\\, in particular Dark Empire. The nerdgasm as you could call it was about to be off the charts. Instead of an awesome display of what Luke's often thought of capabilities\\, he is written delivering a hoodwink. Not only on the villain but the audience also. This is made even more unsatisfying by the fact he just dies because he's tired afterwards.\\nA huge disappointment after building up so much good will.","true":true}
