We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is filled with moments that are supposedly meant to be bold and smart but in my opinion are just cheap\\, unearned and lazily written. Joel is nothing but a lamb sacrifice for a plot that\u2019s been overused in entertainment media: revenge. His death\\, in my opinion was not at all emotional (not in a good way at least)\\, it was just shocking for the sake of shock value. In the first game\\, not even 20 minutes into it\\, you were already crying when Sarah died like she was your own daughter when you didn\u2019t even know who she was 10-20 minutes before. Unfortunately that masterful writing skill does not exist in this game as Joel\u2019s death does nothing but anger you at how poorly handled his death scene was.   Clearly not understanding what made the first game great\\, naughty dog introduces a new character (abby) to replace joel. Right off the bat replacing either joel or ellie In a story that revolves around them and is successful because of them is already near impossible. So bringing a new character that mutilates the main character of the first game isn\u2019t great way to get us invested into abby. Of course naughty dog tried real hard to get you to see abby\u2019s perspective yet\\, in my honest opinion\\, did not succeed.   To top it off do not expect Joel\u2019s death to pay off in this game as LITERALLY every character involved in his death was either killed in a quick time event or cutscene EXCEPT for abby\\, because ellie\\, after murdering everybody\\, finally decided it was not worth it anymore\u2026 Expand","true":true}
