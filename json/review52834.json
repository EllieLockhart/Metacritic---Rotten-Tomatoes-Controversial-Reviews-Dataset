Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of plot holes.  Doesn't honor Star Wars canon.  Don't like how Luke was portrayed.  Finn and Rose end up being worthless characters.  Rey's background is a huge disappointment.  What Luke does in the end he should have done in person and it would have had more meaning..  Superman Leia is a stretch.  The first order chasing the rebels for more than half the movie was lazy writing.  The movie is full of political correctness with the portrayal of income inequality\\, females are stronger\\, smarter and more endearing than the dumb men.  I liked the Yoda cameo except where Yoda burns down the Jedi temple tree which is like Disney's way of flipping the bird to old cannon and making way of Disney's way of doing things.  I liked all of Chewbacca's scenes and the Millenium Falcon is awesome as usual.","true":true}
