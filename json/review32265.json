Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fan here. Luke acted way out of character. Traumatic events change people\\, but it felt like the writers just built a brand new jedi master who is not Luke Skywalker. Unacceptable. So much potential was wasted and nothing made since. Whole subplots were useless and new characters were unreasonable and had little to no impact on the movie. Tons of potential\\, nothing delivered. Leia is apparently God now. Humor was ridiculous and the movie felt like it was fully branded and directed by Disney. It felt like The Avengers with ridiculous writing. I am very disappointed. Wait to rent the movie if you have to see it.\\n\\nFor the first time in my life (quite litteraly as I grew up watching Star Wars) I am not a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
