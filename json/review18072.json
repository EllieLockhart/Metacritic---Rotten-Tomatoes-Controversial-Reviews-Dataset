Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It honestly feels like Rian Johnson (the director) and the team of writers simply didn't watch or didn't care about Star War TFA.\\n50% of the jokes fell flat\\, plot points that were set up in the previous movie were thrown out the window or completely butchered. A Subplot that was a complete waste of time. And other \\\"spoilery\\\" problems that I won't mention.\\nBut hey at least the visuals were great.","true":true}
