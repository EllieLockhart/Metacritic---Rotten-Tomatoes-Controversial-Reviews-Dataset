Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adam Driver was excellent. Three to four of the scenes were great\\, or excellent. But most of the movie's narrative was hollow and inconsistent. There were long periods where I was bored. I didn't care about the characters\\, or what happened to them. The narrative didn't get me to emotionally invest in them. I didn't really care if they got what they wanted or needed. It's the first StarWars movie I've ever seen where afterward\\, I thought\\, \\\"That was okay\\, but I'm not sure I would watch it again.\\\" The movie could have been a very awesome 30-45 minute short.","true":true}
