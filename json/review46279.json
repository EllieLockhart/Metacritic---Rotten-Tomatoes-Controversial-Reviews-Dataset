Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was an enjoyable movie.  There was some deviation from the written non screen canon but I can live with that.  Some ends that did not seem loose were prematurely tied up.  Thought some of the characters that were lost had a lot of story left in them.","true":true}
