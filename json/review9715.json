Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good soundtrack and effects\\, some of the acting was great\\, some was exceptionally bad. Plot was so full of holes it was laughable by the end. Pacing was terrible\\, there was a small irrelevant bad movie cut into an okay (ignoring gaping holes in a plot that makes no sense) movie. Also any question you wanted answered by this movie either wasn't addressed at all\\, or was answered with \\\"it doesn't matter\\\". All the build up of questions and characters just to brush them off. Might be the most flawed plot of an \\\"A\\\" list movie ever\\, definitely of the thousands I've ever seen.","true":true}
