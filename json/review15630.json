Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the original Star Wars Trilogy and liked The Force Awakens as well.  However\\, The Last Jedi was the absolute worst movie of the Star Wars franchise\\, and that is saying quite a bit considering you have Episode One with Jar Binks to compete with it.  No spoilers\\, but this movie ruins my childhood with horrible plot holes and poor character development.  The visual effects are great but everything else about the movie is terrible.  Shame on you Lucasfilm\\, you better hope JJ Abrams can pull a rabbit out of his hat to save the trilogy when he wraps it up with next film.  Save your money and don't see this film in theaters.  Rent it went it comes out just to see how truly far the Star Wars series has fallen.","true":true}
