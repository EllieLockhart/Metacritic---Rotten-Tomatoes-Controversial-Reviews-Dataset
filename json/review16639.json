Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly disappointing and disheartening. Was hoping to simply watch a movie about star wars to find that had been hijacked to push Disney's political agendas. Movie ruins everything established by previous films\\, especially most beloved characters. Luke sucks now because he is a guy. Po sucks now and is stupid because he is a guy. Finn sucks and needs a woman to babysit him because he is a guy. The only characters who don't suck are the women\\, who have to put the men in place because men are all stupid and should just let all the women be in charge. This is not star wars and its not a good movie. Critics couldn't stop patting movie on the back for being so politically correct even though the storytelling was logically stupid. Why? Because writing a good script wasn't on the priority list. There were Plot holes big enough to fit the death star through and half of the film went down a rabbit trail to tell us capitalism and animal abuse are bad. Ok cool\\, wait isn't this star wars? Used to think the prequels were bad but this is a vomit fest","true":true}
