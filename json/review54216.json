Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you came out of the Force Awakens with high hopes and happy then stop there and don't watch you will be filled with disappointment.  The Last Jedi rips away pieces of the original trilogy\\, and puts them together in a comedic mess.  If you're expecting to see a traditional or risk taking Star Wars look away\\, this is yet another \\\"Star Wars Story\\\".  You will not see a frightening and strong evil.  You will not see Jedi battles.  You will see many characters do stupid things.  You will see many pointless and meaningless events.  You will not hear the magical explanation of the force that Ben Kenobi gave us when he explained the force in Episode IV.  You will find the cold\\, calculating Imperial leaders are no more. They have all been replaced with the weak New Order\\, a laughing stock.  No longer do we have a cold crisp Tarken\\, or the table of sinister looking military leaders.  Instead we have Hux\\, a man that has less tactical knowledge than a 10 year old kid that plays video games.  Sadly it does not stop there\\, it gets worse for the next 2 hours and 15 minutes.","true":true}
