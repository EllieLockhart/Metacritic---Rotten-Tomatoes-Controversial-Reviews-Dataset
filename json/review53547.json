Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone saying this is \\\"SW for Millennials\\\" or \\\"SW for girls\\\" or \\\"SW for people of color\\\" STOP saying that!\\nI'm a girl... I'm Asian... I'm a Millennial... and I HATED this garbage! \\n\\nIf Disney really expected this would attract people like me\\, their marketing ppl are delusional. In fact\\, Rose and the woman with purple hair were the characters I least connected with and Porgs are a dumb CGI commercial for toys.\\n \\nSuch a shame because at the end TFA I really wanted to know what happens next to Rey\\, Finn\\, Kylo\\, etc.\\nNow i've seen it\\, I don't care anymore. Episode IX? I just... don't... care.","true":true}
