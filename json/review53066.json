Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A special effects extravaganza that desperatly tries to sever ties with it\u00b4s legacy and alienate it\u00b4s fanbase\\, trading enthusiasm for self-deprecating insincerity and pandering to topical sensitivities. A waste of an otherwise stellar cast\\,who did the best they could with the given script.","true":true}
