Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke suffers from Major Depressive Disorder and the whole movie is about his psycho therapy rather than anything else then he ends up committing a weird act of suicide. This the weirdest twist to a generational saga. Whoever came up with this should be dragged out of his office and crucified. He messed up a whole generation whom Luke symbolized something far greater than Star Wars.\\n\\nIt is Luke Skywalker god damn it. \\n\\nYou need to watch it to understand how one person can mess up a generation.","true":true}
