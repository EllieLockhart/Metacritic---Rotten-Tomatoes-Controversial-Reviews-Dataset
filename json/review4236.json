Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst so called Star Wars ever.. Cant even think of a single good thing about.. dont believe the hype Disney destroyed another once great series.. lol even Luke (mark hamill) said the movie was made just for money and was trash lol. NOT worth getting paid 10 dollars for your time watching it.","true":true}
