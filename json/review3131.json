Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Baffled by the critic reviews. \\n\\nPlot was terrible\\, killed off any interesting plot points and introduced nothing\\, killed off the villain with no payoff\\, logically inconsistent\\, poor comedic delivery from many actors (except Finn).  Killed one of the all time greatest characters - on an Island\\, alone\\, for no apparent reason. What an absolute tragedy of cinema for Like Skywalker to be given that send off.\\n\\nThe fact the Adam Driver is a great actor is the sole positive in the movie.","true":true}
