Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was definitely disappointed by this film. I didn't despise it but there was a glaring hole in this film that I can't believe Rian Johnson thought he could get away with. Why was there no lightsaber duel in this movie? It's trademark to have an epic battle around the climax of the film and it set up a final showdown perfectly and it failed. Adam Driver was excellent\\, Daisy and Mark were good and there was enough going on for 2 and a half hours to keep me interested but the lack of lightsaber duels were definitely disappointing ","true":true}
