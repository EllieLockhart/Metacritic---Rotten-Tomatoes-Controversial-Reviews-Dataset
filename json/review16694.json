Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never really had an excitement for this latest Star Wars movie after the disappointing result of the Prequels and the ok results of The Force Awakens but I just couldn't believe all the things they established that they didn't follow through with!! What were the writers and producers thinking? Clearly they need people in charge at Disney who know how to tell a story.","true":true}
