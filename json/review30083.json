Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad attempt at a Star Wars movie.  The first 20 minutes are pretty good and then it falls off the rails.  Bad humor\\, a weak story and useless plots filled with holes cause you to leave the theatre with tons of questions.  There were a few things that worked but the whole movie fell short of any expectations.","true":true}
