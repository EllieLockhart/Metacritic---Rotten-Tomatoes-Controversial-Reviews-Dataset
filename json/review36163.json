Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was easily the worst SW film ever made. I have invested a lot in the Star Wars franchise over the years. Kathleen Kennedy needs to be fired for putting her personal agenda over simple good storytelling and filmmaking. Rian Johnson should stick to TV serials like Breaking Bad instead of being her Yes man. I would put this crap right up there with the other Rotten Tomatoes anointed superflop\\, Ghostbusters (2016). Most of the serious plot holes and lack of story development in this film have been revealed by other real reviewers like me. Don't believe the multitude of positive bots and SJW's attempting to salvage the rating here. Real Star Wars fans and reasonable people hate The Last Jedi. There is a reason why most of the positive ratings on here are only a few sentences long. They are not real people and obviously not real Star Wars fans. I have watched The Last Jedi three times now hoping to see something to look forward to in the next one but the crap in the movie just smells worse. FIRE KATHLEEN KENNEDY NOW!!!","true":true}
