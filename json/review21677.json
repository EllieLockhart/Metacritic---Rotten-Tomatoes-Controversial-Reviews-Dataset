Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just all around bad. 15 minute chase scene stretched out into 2 1\/2 hours. No character development\\, no logic (bombs do not \\\"drop\\\" in zero gravity\\\" and space fuel?? etc..) and a total disregard for The Force Awakens\\, and the mysteries that movie introduced. Constant humor\\, and the way they handled Luke\\, and the Force\\, I mean they have introduced Force powers that would have come in real handy in the last 7 movies\\, why now? It's like this guy never seen Star Wars.","true":true}
