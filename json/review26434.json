Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now available on Netflix ... but I could not get through it again. The massive plot holes: gravity bombs in space; a 'space chase' in which smaller ships can come and go for casino trips. \\nThe 'resistance' was basically eliminated - down to 30 or so people with no leadership. \\nExtremely disappointing. It felt like a hit job on the franchise.","true":true}
