Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel Star Wars has always been a franchise of mostly subpar movies (with a few exceptions)\\, with most of what I enjoy about it coming from video games\\, books\\, and things outside the movies. Few of the movies have ever risen above \\\"decent\\,\\\" in my opinion\\, and my expectation for any Star Wars movie is simply for it to be enjoyable\\, and not irredeemably terrible. That is an extremely low standard.\\nThe Last Jedi\\, however\\, is irredeemably terrible. It suffers from an asinine and nonsensical plot\\, shamelessly tossing away any (potentially) interesting plot points established by the previous movie and introducing nothing new that makes me curious to see what will happen in Episode IX. The newer characters suffer from a complete lack of development\\, and old characters are simply included in order to pretend that this movie actually has anything to do with the other Star Wars films. It does not. Without spoiling everything\\, it tarnishes the reputation of old characters in a nonsensical manner\\, it fails to build up new characters\\, it inserts cheesy quips and one-liners in ways that kill the mood of any more serious scenes\\, it is ridden with plot holes\\, and its fight scenes are uninteresting at best and cringy at worst. The Last Jedi has absolutely no redeeming or salvageable qualities because it was written poorly from start to finish\\, and it sets up Epsiode IX to be an even bigger disaster unless IX retcons everything\\, because there is nothing of interest left in the franchise after this waste of a film.","true":true}
