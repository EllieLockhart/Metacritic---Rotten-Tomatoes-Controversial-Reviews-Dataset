Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely incredible movie. Don\u2019t know why everybody seems to be displeased with it. Disney is doing wonderful with the Star Wars franchise. I have watched and been of every Star Wars movie to date with the original trilogy being my favorite by far. I feel like this movie gave exactly what the franchise needed: a refreshing start. In the Force Awakens there was a lot of suspense left hanging for the viewers. So many people speculated what would happen that I came into this movie expecting it to be predictable. It was the polar opposite. I can\u2019t tell you one thing that I predicted correctly about this movie and that\u2019s what I love about it. 10\/10\\, will be paying to see it again.","true":true}
