Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok. Here's my take on it:\\nI almost fell asleep a few times. While Rogue 1 had the benefit of being a self contained story\\, this was just not a good film. The cinematography was even bad. The \\\"kiddy\\\" elements made a return. \\nRay is still a Mary Sue. Kylo is still Darth Emo. And Luke was out of character\\, almost like a creepy old child molester at points. And he could have been so badass. Oh and the Antifa anti capitalism SJW politics was great additions to star wars too. The \\\"your mom\\\" joke though. Top notch writing there!!\\nI really wanted to like it but I'm not going to lie\\, the movie Lost me after less than 20 minutes.\\nStar Wars as we know it is dead. Now we live in a universe where no woman can do wrong\\, can succeed without ever facing any adversity\\, and men are stupid or evil\\, just like the terrorists... I mean \\\"Resistance\\\"... I won't be seeing it again. And I'm not gonna shit on people who like the film\\, but the saga for me is getting more and more unrelatable as each movie goes on.","true":true}
