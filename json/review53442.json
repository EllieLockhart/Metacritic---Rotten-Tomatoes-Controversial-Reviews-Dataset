Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney must be paying critics for reviews. Seriously an awful movie. Graphics are amazing and the score is phenomenal but that's the only good thing about it. It was almost like watching a parody movie about star wars featuring original star wars actors. They wanted to make the empire strikes back equivalent\\, but with zero stakes in the game while trying to make it seem grander\\, you knew nothing to happen to the good guys. They keep making the first order weapons bigger and seemingly stronger but the resistance literally only needs one ship to take out the biggest baddest ships the first order has. The writing was lazy and jokes fall flat. When something funny actually happened I was too annoyed to laugh because of some stupid thing happening right before it. If you appreciate the George Lucas cannon you probably won't like this film. If you're looking for entertainment\\, it might be your thing but unlike the force awakens this movie felt like a mess. It's ironic because the whole message of the movie is destroying the past while constantly bring up everything from previous films. Go watch and form your own opinion. This is the Phantom menace of the Disney sagas.","true":true}
