Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forgetting the conspiracy nonsense about strong female characters and why fans hate it\\, this just isn't a good movie. The miss judged comedy makes a mockery of villains\\, something Star Wars never has\\, and huge sections of the film are completely superfluous. The last act feels tagged on in order to have an 'Empire' scene (but it's salt\\, not Ice\\, so no copying?!) and the film should have ended after the one good bit - the battle with the crimson guard chaps. Added to this we have; gravity and bombing in spade\\, the slowest chase in movie history\\, a movie about fuel\\, not telling the plan\\, pointless quests with pointless characters\\, weaponising lightspeed?! And Luke is wasted and belittled. And I thought 'The Force Awakens' was bad.........","true":true}
