Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What's left to say that hasn't been said? This is\\, by far\\, the worst major studio production I've ever seen in a theater. There are hundreds of hours of analysis out there detailing everything wrong with this film\\, but I think they all miss the point: if you were to make a film with the intention of giving a massive middle finger to all fans of the franchise\\, the very people who made it a monumental success for 40 years\\, you simply couldn't do a better job than this film. From that standpoint\\, it's a masterpiece. As a film\\, it's a complete travesty.","true":true}
