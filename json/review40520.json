Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the second film\\, not the final film. It bears no responsibility to explain the secrets laid out in the first. I wouldn't be surprised to learn more about Snoke in the next episode\\, and I also wouldn't be surprised if Kylo lies about Rey's origins - it's not like he had much motivation to tell the truth. This was a great film and it is irresponsible of fans to punish it for not servicing their every need. I'll definitely be seeing it again!","true":true}
