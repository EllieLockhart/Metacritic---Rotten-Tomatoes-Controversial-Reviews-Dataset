Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Within a few moments of the film starting I felt like I was watching a SNL spoof. The entire movie felt like it was written and directed by someone who \\\"LOVES\\\" The Phantom Menace but just could not live up to making it as \\\"good.\\\"  Just stop Disney\\, this kind of tripe is ruining everything and anything left to love about this story.  TLJ is a shoddy story full of meaningless plot and scenes\\, culminating into a epic disappointment. I'd expect better story from a high school creative writing club.","true":true}
