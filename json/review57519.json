Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a masterpiece of a Star Wars movie. I enjoyed the plot and character development Rian Johnson demonstrated on the screen. The jokes of the movie were a moving point to me. In the beginning\\, Poe makes various remarks toward General Hux\\, possibly even calling him General Hugs\\, which I thoroughly laughed at for ten minutes. Then\\, he made a \\\"your mom\\\" joke\\, which I appreciated the Star Wars franchise adding in. Poe is a good character in the galaxy\\, adding sass and leadership\\, as well as a growing itch to learn and gain more power. Basically\\, Poe is 11\/10. This movie also had other jokes\\, having Kylo smack Hux on the Floor with the force choke\\, making me spit my drink out in the seat in front of me. Kylo hates Hux and I stand for it. In another part\\, Kylo smacks his helmet against the wall\\, illustrating his growing frustration\\, which made me quake because it was so powerful in his transition to being a power on his own\\, no weird obsession with Darth Vader. I rate Kylo Ren\\, the awkward angry emo boy an 11\/10 but an 11\/10 notch below Poe\\, who is a snack. The ending\\, where Luke says \\\"see you around kid\\,\\\" was awesome\\, a clear nod to Han Solo always calling Luke \\\"kid.\\\" I liked this as it just pissed off his anger fueled nephew even more\\, which I liked. Basically\\, I've never seen Luke act sassier to anyone\\, which rocked! Sassy Luke is my favorite Luke. The Last Jedi was full of ups and downs in my emotions\\, making me sit in the Edge of my seat. The jokes were hilarious\\, and to all you haters\\, they were good\\, I might even say\\, great! He funniest Star Wars by far. I forgot to post about the part where Poe asked if he could jump in an x wing and  blow up something\\, that was after Leia told him not to\\, CLASSIC! Again\\, Poe was awesome. Anyway\\, The Last Jedi haters can suck it up and deal with the fact that this movie rocks my socks.","true":true}
