Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never experienced a Star Wars movie like this. I didn't sleep last night\\, and it's because of this movie. Because of the thoughts that Rian Johnson put in my head\\, the themes that he is playing with\\, the choices of these characters\\, the way Luke Skywalker went out\\, the introduction of a new mythology and the expansion of mythology on force powers\\, etc... There's so much more going on\\, that was so haunting to me. I was talking to some people next to me about the prequels like they didn't surprise me like this\\, that they were just a treason to me. Well\\, I'm in again\\, having fun with the story. I got so chocked up and so emotional because I thought the journey of Luke Skywalker from New Hope to the Last Jedi is so perfect\\, it's one of the most perfect representation of a character\\, and done well with my childhood hero. This movie has affected me\\, it's wonderful\\, and I'm so glad it exists.\\nMy favourite part of this is that we're now predicting things for the future that\\, if you had asked me what were my predictions for Episode IX before having seen Episode VIII\\, these are things that I did not think we would be discussing the same exact way and\\, really\\, that just leads me to wanting to like just pat Rian Johnson on the back because yes\\, you take risks and some don't pay out and some of these things might not land with certain movie goers out there\\, but when they do pay off\\, they pay off so well and it's so nice to be surprised by such a long-standing franchise. If this movie proves anything\\, it's that you just don't need Episode IX\\, you need a whole other trilogy to explain all the other stuff\\, if not more. So\\, one of the coolest thing about Last Jedi to me is how it justifies the ever growing franchise in so many different ways because there's so many rich little details to explore.","true":true}
