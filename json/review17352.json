Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw ANH 4 times as a 8 year old in the cinema. I agree with the Machete list for SW1-6 and even enjoy Crap Sci-Fi films like Independence day for the shits and giggles. But something went terribly wrong here. Its like a chocolate cake with nice presentation and icing\\, but biting into it it is just coffee grounds inside. I walked out of the cinema liking it\\, but on thinking it through\\, I realised how deliberate this was as a break away movie even though wrapping itself up in the clothing of a Star Wars Series movie. Unfortunately\\, you cant be both.\\nIf they made this movie as an Anthology trilogy\\, then all good. The writers and directors can go different directions. But by virtue of the basis of this trilogy fitting into the Skywalker arc\\, it  needed to key into the lore of the series. Constraints are not bad things guys...they can actually make things more challenging and enriching. The fact those constraints were ignored certainly opens the move up to deserving the backlash it is creating.\\nI like others have seen the claims of BOT reviews not representing the true state of the fanbase and am posting this to show we arent all bots..\\nAs an illustration of the many issues with the movie and NOT utilising the Rich lore that could have been incorporated and actually ENHANCED the story\\, even my 12 year old son was able to point out that a very simple plot device to stop the Raddus Hyperspacing away could have been the Introduction of Interdictor Star Destroyers. These are lore starships from the Xwing and Tie fighter games that have gravity well generators that prevent star ships from going to hyperspace. Just this simple addition and a lot of angst could have been avoided.\\nThis is one of many examples of where the writers were just plain lazy and made up shit to suit the plot instead of integrating canon (we all know now why Disney wiped Canon).\\nUltimately\\, Disney have torn down the importance of having something to look up to or aspire to because you all have that power to what you want to be. The problem is\\, that without these figures its harder to benchmark what to become or avoid. That is pat of the human experience.\\nFinally\\, Luke Skywalker. Others have discussed how ridiculous his fall is compared with his achievements. When I talk about role models\\, his portrayal in this movie does nothing to give hope that anyone can be strong enough to take adversity. Going by this portrayal\\, you could expect Ray to turn up in 9 and say 'Peace not war' and just head to Tatooine and become a moisture farmer...or noone respond to the Resistance's call to help. This is the danger of the example Rian Johnson made of Luke and the reason why the series has no hope going forward because it does not set any examples of resilience and strenght. Makes me really sad to say that\\, but it is true.\\nGreat stand alone Sci-Fi movie or Anthology\\, but not a Star Wars Episode movie in the values that it puts forward as examples to others. Sorry.","true":true}
