Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Graphics: 10\/10\rSound: 10\/10\rGame World: 10\/10\rPerformances: 10\/10\rGameplay: 7\/10\rStory: 2\/10\r\rBeing a story driven game\\, TLOU2 is one of the biggest disappointments of the current console generation. It's not that I don't agree with certain story decision. They just executed it poorly. NONE of the characters live up to the quality of the first game. The plot is manipulative\\, way too overcrowded with subplots and unnecessary love triangles. While exploring the game world and discovering all the tiny secrets is fun\\, I hated to see how the story unfolded.\r\rSome details to explain why I really didn't like the story:\r\rAbby: I get what they were going for. And I'm not mad because she kills Joel. But making me hate her for 15 hours and then make me play this character did not help. Maybe they should have made her playable earlier into the story so I can understand everything BEFORE things happen. Playing her that late into the game didn't make me care about her. I hated this character and after finishing the game I still do. Furthermore\\, this does not change the fact that Abby is a straight up psychopath!  Torturing a guy to death that just saved your life\\, sleeping with your friends boyfriend\\, wanting to kill a pregnant woman (knowingly) and giving a **** about all her friends. But hey\\, she pets some dogs...\r\rJoel: We don't trust strangers....\r\rElie: She knew Joel lied to her at the end of the first game\\, didn't she? Now she's mad? Oh and remember the lighthearted\\, optimistic and caring girl? She's gone! Still better than Abby as she shows immediate reactions to killing innocent people AFTER beging attacked.\r\rJesse: Only likeable character gets shot for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\r\rTommy: Survives a headshot.\r\rAnd what's wrong with pregnant women in this world?\r\rAnd so on...\r\rTLOU2 is a technical masterpiece and a fun game to play. But to experience the \\\"story\\\" is frustrating and angering. What were they thinking?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
