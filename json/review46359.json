Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was not star wars as we know it. No lifesaver battles \\, no real action till the end no major plot no Jedi training the new apprentice she was just ready after a 5 sec lesson it was really low quality the ending was the best part it was terrible movie to add to such a epic series what a let down even if you are a fan don\u2019t see it wait till redbox comes out with it or it\u2019s on for free ","true":true}
