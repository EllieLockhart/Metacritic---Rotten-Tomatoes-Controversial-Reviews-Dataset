Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"would have given it 4 stars if this was episode 7. but its not. its episode 8... and it threw away every single plot point from the force awakens. I feel like iv been trolled. As fun as this movie was to watch\\, i felt the water mark of the director giving me the finger throughout the entire thing. JJ Abrahms (and the writers from force awakens) must be furious. I know i am. \\nLAZER SWORD? \\nreally!? \\nF you Rian Johnson.","true":true}
