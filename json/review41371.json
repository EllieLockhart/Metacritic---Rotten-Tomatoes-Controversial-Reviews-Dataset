Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an absolute embarrassment to the Star Wars name. The treatment of Luke Skywalkers character is nothing short of terrorism. The plot is politically charged to a point where you don't even feel like you're in the Star Wars universe\\, but rather trapped in the very world we go to the movies to try to escape from. The jokes are \\\"joke scenes\\\" instead of witty\\, conversational humor. It's almost so cringingly awkward that you can't hold in your laughter. I was most disgusted by how the feeling of it being a \\\"last gasp\\\" for the rebellion is so pathetically shown. The entire tone of the movie is grossly off point. Comparatively\\, this should have felt equal to the great World War movies\\, where there is a sense of desperation and fight. Instead\\, we are spoonfed the most pathetic cast of characters I have ever seen in a Star Wars film. Albeit there are some shining lights such as Rey. I have never felt more betrayed by a film in my life.","true":true}
