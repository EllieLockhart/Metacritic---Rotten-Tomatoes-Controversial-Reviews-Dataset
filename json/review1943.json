Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As Luke said\\, this won't go the way you think. Maybe not the movie we wanted\\, but definitely the one we needed. It shows that our heroes are capable of failure\\, and what matters is trying our best to rectify the mistake. And sometimes even that is not enough. \\n\\nBeing so long and with multiple plotlines occurring at once\\, it may take a few watches to grasp every detail. That doesn't\\, by any means\\, make the movie a displeasure to watch. It is well shot. More than that\\, it's absolutely beautiful. The major fight scenes as well as the final scene with Holdo are absolutely breathtaking. \\n\\nI personally believe anyone who dislikes the movie isn't looking at it objectively. Just because what happened isn't what you wanted to happen\\, doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Those who said certain characters were out of character haven't taken into consideration what years and despair can do to a person. Not to mention things they nearly did in the past but stopped themselves from doing at the last minute. All actors were on board with the characterization at the end\\, so that isn't an excuse. \\n\\nLastly\\, Rose Tico is just adorable.","true":true}
