We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really enjoyed The Last Of Us Part II. There are many heartbreaking and shocking moments in the game\\, but they are balanced by the many very intense\\, action moments. Overall I loved the game\\, the part with Ellie was increadable\\, with her going on this brutal path of revenge. If I could change the story I would only change two things\\, the part with Abby being this long\\, I wish we could get to play with Ellie even more and I hope we can get to play with Ellie more in part III.The second thing would be to not kill Joel this early in the game or give him a hero\u2019s death\\, other from that I wouldn\u2019t change anything else. The gameplay is just phenomenal\\, I don\u2019t think I have ever played a game where the gameplay and all of the animations are that smooth\\, every fight encounter feels very realistic and intense. However\\, I think\\, the part with Abby wasn\u2019t as good as the part with Ellie\\, but I understand why ND let us play as Abby\\, it\u2019s to try to create empathy for Abby. Overall the game is amazing and I know some people didn\u2019t like the ending\\, but the ending is a lot more than just an ending\\, it perfectly sets up perfectly for part III\u2026 Expand","true":true}
