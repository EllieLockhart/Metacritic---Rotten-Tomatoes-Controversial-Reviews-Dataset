Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing! A lot has been said of this film and the controversies that have come out since it's release but in hindsight i can't forgive the film's negative points\\, Critics highlight how it's quite groundbreaking that the \\\"mystery box\\\" created by Abrams in the previous film was in essence made null and void in this. That to me is a negative\\, if I enjoy mysteries why is this seen as a bad thing. I do agree that making Rey her own person and not linked is a bold and story driven choice but to then dismiss the other unanswered questions it negates what fans enjoyed speculating over for the 2 year gap in the entries. 6 months on the speculation which was rife following the Force Awakens is non existent for episode 9\\, I can't help but feel that this film is to blame.","true":true}
