Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A strong follow-up to The Force Awakens with a fair balance of storytelling and action. While not as many of the great practical effects used by JJ Abrams in TFA\\, there was a fair amount at the right times. Some new characters and lots of surprises.\\n\\nFans looking for something that belongs alongside the original Trilogy will probably be disappointed\\, and consider it an affront to their precious childhoods (that apparently only existed because of Episodes IV through VI.) It doesn't belong to that trilogy-- it wouldn't fit. This is a unique film in the Star Wars pantheon\\, and has a place in the new trilogy. Some criticisms are unfairly pinned on the film due to veiled misogyny and racism. Not all\\, but some. It's reminiscent of the Ghostbusters debacle of '16; taking a good film and beating it down with outright misogyny and chauvinism despite the film providing great laughs\\, great effects\\, and delivering a decent amount of fan service.\\n\\nI think true fans of the franchise will find things they love and some things they don't care for. And casual fans will find something they enjoy in this film. An important thing about this film that I noticed is that it is unlike any other Star Wars film-- and that's a good thing. A lot of new ways of representing the Star Wars Universe are tested here\\, and I feel like a lot of them were successful.\\n\\nI enjoyed the film-- I was satisfied and it met my expectations. I was surprised\\, I laughed\\, I felt true emotions\\, and I really loved the action sequences. I recommend this film for all Star Wars fans.","true":true}
