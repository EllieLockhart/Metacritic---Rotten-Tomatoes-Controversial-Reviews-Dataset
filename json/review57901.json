Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a huge disappointment. And where to begin? As a life long star wars fan  feel like this movies mission was to erase all more before it and completely start anew. Anyone can now have the force\\, not require training and be great. They even push it in the movie \\\" kill the past\\, move on from it blah blah\\\"\\n\\nAlso\\, characters set up in ep 7 are disregarded in this movie\\, in insulting fashion.\\nThis movie obviously makes it easy for Disney to make a dozen more movies.\\n\\nNow what bothered me the most was how Luke was \\nhandled. After 30 years we waited for his great return only to be disappointed in Force awakens. And in the movie\\, it was just a slap to the face to his character and his fans.\\nAm I excited where star wars is going? No. Am I looking forward  to the next movie? For the first time ever\\, no. Why? Because they still have not given me a reason to care for any of the characters\\, or story. Let the first order take over and be done with it..","true":true}
