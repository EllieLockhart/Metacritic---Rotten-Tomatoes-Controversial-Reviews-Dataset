{"101487":171439,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-06","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SURPRISE\\n\\nI did not enjoyed TFA. First half of the movie was entertaining\\, but second was thorough disaster. I even found it's laziness and total lack of sense offending. My expectations for TLJ were non existing. So\\, i consumed most of  spoilers on internet with belief that there is nothing to be spoiled. Then i gone to theater. Then movie started. Then came that great opening scene with camera fast diving from ships in orbit to resistance base and soldiers. FO star destroyers slipping in to the sky\\, and another jump in orbit. I was surprised. For moment\\, even forget to Moron Hux. Then that battle scene\\, Paige's sacrifice (little role\\, big acting). Another surprise. A New Hope!\\n\\nJOY\\n\\nKylo's and Rey's chemistry worked\\, even started to think that some kind of redemption is possible. Great cave scene\\, visually beautiful and with (at least for me) clear message that Rey is one of many incarnations of chosen one. Those ''everything you said is lie'' and ''controlling people and lifting rocks'' scenes\\, nicely reused later in movie. Throne room fight scene. Even some decent laughs! I actually started to enjoy damn movie!\\n\\nCONFUSION\\n\\nThen movie ended. My wife asked me did i enjoyed the movie\\, or would i keep on nagging like the last time. I found my self strangely silent. Why could't i just said ''Well. this one was great!''? Something was not OK. Something was holding me back. Then my son (nine year old) said ''First he is bad\\, then he is good\\, then he is bad\\, why he could not make up his mind for once?!''. Something was bad here. I new what\\, just was not willing to admit my self yet.\\n\\nDISAPOINTMENT\\n\\nI now what was bad. Exactly the same thing as in TFA. Bad and lazy writing with very little sense. Writer bend the story to use to his purposes\\, instead to let it flow with it's own current.\\nAnti-aircraft cannons that can not hit aircraft''s? Shields work when it is convenient.  Idiots for commanders. There is a tracking device that secret that even the leader of the force that uses it does not knows for it\\, but low level tech on opposite side has detailed blueprint of device and ship device is on. (this is center plot point of entire movie) I would give life saving instructions to my friends in Maz's style\\, only if i would wont to yank them! And that is bad\\, because i should try to save their's lives. And Maz being in trouble with Union is lame excuse. Not impossible\\, just lame. Luke is sacrificed for sake of Kylo's redemption\\, that never came. Writer did not wanted to include Knights of Ren\\, because he would kill them? If Rose is so in love with Finn\\, why did't she rammed her's speeder in that stupid canon? Why people having problem with milking scene? Because breasts of that thing looks too much like humans breasts\\, look on Luke's face is perverse and on Rey's is pure disgust. I now\\, Luke did that on purpose to chase Rey away\\, but that is not (proper) excuse.\\nGuns on Finn's speeder melts\\, to convince us that he can not fire at canon\\, but rest of speeder does not\\, although entire craft is inside of melting ray. Even laughs! Afther movie i felt like i was 10 again\\, and i just laugh on joke about that fat little guy with glasses. And i felt pretty bad afterwards.  There is nothing funny about rock that could just killed two living beings\\, or furry monster eating someones mom.  Others finished this list (watch Maulers critique\\, if you want)\\, so i would stop here. Yes\\, OT was flawed\\, there was plot holes also\\, but not near as here. Obi van was walking proof of failure\\, but he atleast kept dignity.  \\n\\nINDIFFERENCE\\n\\nMy childhood is not ruined. Nothing would ever change my memories on moments spent in old theater\\, watching Return of the Jedi with my father. Nor watching for first time Empire on VHS with my sister. Everything is pretty much same. Just\\, there is no any new SW movies to join those memories (Rogue One\\, maybe?). SW is business\\, now more than ever. I'm not angry\\, not disappointed and i do not hate this movie or its makers. I just do not care\\, especially now when i let all that out f me. \\nThere is some decent stuff in this movie\\, so there are two stars from me. For more\\, they have to make me care again. If they care about that at all.","true":true}
