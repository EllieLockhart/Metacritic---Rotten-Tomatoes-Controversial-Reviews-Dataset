Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I lost count of how many times my eyes rolled or how many times I cringed during this movie. I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid and it pains me to say I enjoyed The Last Jedi even less than the prequels. They've basically taken the characters we've come to know and love\\, crapped on them\\, and replaced them with soulless-pointless-aimless wastes of screen time. Whoever wrote the dialog never watched any of the original films. People in the Star Wars universe don't talk like The Avengers or any number of Joss Weadon's snarky characters. \\nThe plot undermines itself\\, it breaks established physical rules the universe has set up. It is so long that even if you removed the terrible middle section at the casino\\, it would still feel bloated. They try to give you a sense there's a dire urgency for the cast to accomplish their soon to be rendered pointless goals by having us believe that watching two grannies chase each other on scooters is as heart pumping as Mad Max.\\nI can't count the number of utterly stupid decisions that were made in making this film. I was willing to give Star Wars a chance with The Force Awakens despite it containing nothing original but the series is now dead to me. Even the most blind fanboy when they really break this movie down will realize how much worse it is even compared to The Phantom Menace.","true":true}
