Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not my favorite SW movie ever. I'll start with that. Did I hate it? Absolutely not. Did I love it? No\\, not really. It's a solid entry with some epic action and superb visuals. My main objection is the wacky humor in the first half of it. To me\\, it makes the movie feel less Empire Strikes Back and more Jar Jar stepping in bantha poop. Dawn said she thought I meant it wasn't reverent enough to the more serious aspects of the saga. The second half\\, though? Absolutely epic and perfectly done. Do I recommend it to Star Wars fans? Yes. Definitely see this. It is important to the ongoing story and a lot happens in it to advance the story. Does it represent the SW franchise the best of any of other seven movies for newbies? No\\, it's not the one you should use to introduce anyone to this universe. In the end\\, I liked The Force Awakens more\\, but this was leagues better than the three prequels. Plus\\, Luke does some badass Jedi trickery toward the end. See and enjoy it for being part of the overall story. But\\, don't expect to be blown away like you were when you first saw Empire almost 40 years ago. ","true":true}
