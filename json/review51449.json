Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A canonical abomination in the (then) longest film in the saga where little is accomplished for the new cast\\, and the memory of the old is firmly stomped on with world-breaking logic\\, dull performances\\, low energy and an overall narrative that is neither justified or engaging at all. By far the slowest two and a half hours in Star Wars.","true":true}
