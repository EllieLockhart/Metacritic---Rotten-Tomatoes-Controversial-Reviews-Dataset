Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel I am being generous with this rating. I was thoroughly disappointed in this film not only because it took away from the authenticity and character development of the first Star Wars films\\, but because even as a stand alone movie it lacked the key elements of story and character. I literally cringed during lines like \\\"chrome dome\\\" that cheapened the plot. The original characters from episode 7 were inconsistent and contradictive. The plot was scattered and required many gaps in judgement in order to believe the story. It's Star Wars\\, so light speed and floating rocks are acceptable\\, but a bunker on a salt planet and a pre-made Death Star gun are just plot holes. The new characters introduced had no dimension (and were all potentially killed off by the end).  The CGI and fight sequences were great\\, but you need more than animated aircrafts to tell a decent story.","true":true}
