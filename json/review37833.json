Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some good moments but overall it was terrible. Vice Admiral Holdo was an incompetent leader. There was no reason to withhold her plan. There was no reason she could not have used the smaller ships\\, that were destroyed anyway\\, to hyperspace ram the First Order fleet. She did nothing to lift her crew's spirits\/morale to the point that many of them were willing to mutiny. There was no reason for her to personally pilot the ship and commit suicide since an astromech droid could have easily done that. It was pointless. What a waste of a potentially strong female character. Well she was strong\\, but unfortunately also an idiot. Filled with immersion breaking plot holes and what basically amounts to a number of huge F*** You's to the fan base (because when you are running a business\\, as film is a business\\, its always good to actively insult your oldest and most loyal customers\\, who cares what they want?) The Last Jedi ended up being a wasted opportunity and a demonstrably bad movie.","true":true}
