Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a fetid turd of a movie. You're going to make the central character of this whole franchise go against his character\\, decades of close personal loyalties and everything he's built his life on for a dream he has one night?!? What a hack script. Shame on all of you for taking something wonderful and turning it to crap. Couldn't even be bothered to give him a meaningful ending. He disappears?!? Give me a break. Rian Johnson if I ever run into you at a restaurant I swear to God I'm going to punch you in the face as hard as I can\\, and I carry brass knuckles.","true":true}
