Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just can\u2019t like this movie. Way to many plot holes and utter BS. I really hope JJ can pull off a big save on episode 9 because otherwise this franchise risks losing a large portion of its fan base. Also Disney needs to rethink it\u2019s choice to let Rian Johnson helm the next trilogy. I personally think R.J. ruined episode 8 and I\u2019m skeptical on whether or not it can be fixed!","true":true}
