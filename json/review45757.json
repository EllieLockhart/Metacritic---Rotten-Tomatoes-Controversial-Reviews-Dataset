Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very hard to give this movie a grade. \\nThe rey kylo stuff was great and also i loved the third act. \\nthe entire poe vs holdo thing was bad \\nand then the ugly\\, the finn rose canto bite thingy. just awful.","true":true}
