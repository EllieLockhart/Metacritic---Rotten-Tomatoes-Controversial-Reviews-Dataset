Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey\\, Disney.\\nCould you make version film for SW fans without:\\n1 Stupid 'marvel' jokes;\\n2 Super - Leia;\\n3 So many animal for marketing.\\nAs a fan I wanna see more Snouk\\, him story\\, but no porgs (It's huge mistake).\\n\\nIn conclusion I liked you idea about jedi and sith\\, you have a excellent trailer but not a film. Just make film as its trailer.\\nSorry for my english.","true":true}
