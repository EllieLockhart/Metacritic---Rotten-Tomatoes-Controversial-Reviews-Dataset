{"101487":163739,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quick Summary - \\nAckbar dies > Snoke dies > Phasma steps on screen\\, then dies > Luke Dies after he gets tired. Finn does nothing > Rose does nothing > Poe does nothing > Rey is a literal who? Stormtroopers were in the film\\, I think? Porgs. Leia superman flying in space (I'm Mary Poppins y'all). R2 was in the film\\, I think? Chewie was in the film\\, I think? Rey is good with the force for no reason. Snoke's ship does nothing > Snoke was never explored. Knights of Ren retconned out. All battle tactics are to run right at opposition in a straight line > Space is really confined > You cannot spread out or out maneuver in space. WW2 vertical bomb drops in space (space gravity). Space vacuum inconsistent between bombing scenes and Leia scenes. Half the movie could have been cut if the purple haired lady (Hunger Games) simply shared her plan with Poe.\\n\\nLuke has been destroyed by The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe young man who once defied Yoda to rush off and save his friends\\, and refused to kill an evil man to instead redeem him is no more. Instead he abandons his friends to fight a war without him\\, and thinks to kill his nephew because he's afraid of him (oh noes\\, he Ben had a bad dream... where's my lightsaber\\, I need to kill him). Luke as a heroic figure has been dragged through the mud. The Western world's most iconic template for the hero's journey\\, the venture from innocence to experience\\, the reward of self-development\\, wisdom\\, and discipline has been intentionally deconstructed to make way for Rey.\\n\\nWhy is this important? Because stories are important. A cultural lexicon is important. Stories are the cipher by which we learn to interpret the world\\, and the values and virtues we learn from them are carried with us through life. Millions of people\\, generations\\, grew up with Luke Skywalker's journey from hot-headed\\, impatient\\, brash youth\\, to wise\\, patient\\, and disciplined experience. He showed the reward in self-improvement and virtue over quick temper and baseness.\\n\\nWhy did this have to be erased? Because Kathleen Kennedy and her team of corporate suits in the backroom who don't know about Star Wars\\, only about money\\, have decided that irreverence is key to demolishing the past to make way for the new future. Good people can't exist\\, because this is problematic to their new agenda of \\\"grey\\\" morality. Things like truth\\, virtue\\, and the Good are contrary to their murky worldview. You thought Luke Skywalker was good? No\\, no one can ever truly be good according to their agenda. Only Rey can be good\\, their new action figure they want to sell. Rey\\, the effortlessly competent\\, loved by everyone\\, prodigy. Luke's journey and development has to be destroyed so that Rey can be a paragon of virtue while Luke is just a sad old man now.\\n\\nIt's immensely clear that the people behind this movie and the new universe only had the old cast back to use them as shallow tools to legitimize the passing of a huge money-printing property to Disney in the public eye\\, and now those tools are being disposed of. Mark Hamill saw it and has been heartbroken in interviews. These people don't care about crafting important stories and characters\\, they only care about the bottom line and pushing agendas.\\n\\nAnd people will say\\, \\\"HEY COME ON IT'S JUST FOR KIDS.\\\" Yeah. That's the point.\\n\\nDo you want a kid to grow up seeing the story of Luke Skywalker\\, a farm boy from humble beginnings who improves himself through discipline and trial to change from an immature youth to a seasoned master of his domain and force for virtue by making friends and family? Or do you think it would be better for kids to see the story of Rey? The girl who is effortlessly good at everything and single-handedly solves every problem she comes across herself with natural Godlike ability\\, an unstoppable force\\, that everyone loves and she never struggles or fails? Which message is better for kids?\\n\\nAnd now when kids see Luke Skywalker achieve enlightenment by the end of ROTJ\\, are they then supposed to watch The Last Jedi and see it all undone? And see the hero revert?\\n\\nIt is all about deconstructing heroes. That's all it is. Blatant\\, transparent\\, pathetic.","true":true}
