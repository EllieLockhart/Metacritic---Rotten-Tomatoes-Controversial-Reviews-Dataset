Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing The Force Awakens\\, I left the theater with a grin from ear to ear saying that that was one of the best movies I had seen in my entire life!!!! I am 29 years old and that is the ONLY movie that I\u2019ve ever seen twice in the theaters! I loved getting to know Rey\\, Poe\\, Bb8\\, & Fin.... they nailed it . The Last Jedi was a plain disappointment. It didn\u2019t feel genuine. It felt like the studios rushed and made a crappy movie because they could make more money. Why oh why was JJ Abrams not the director again?!? I did like it a bit more than Rogue I. I\u2019ve never written a review on here\\, but felt the need to after seeing this. Signed\\, Disney messed up big time ","true":true}
