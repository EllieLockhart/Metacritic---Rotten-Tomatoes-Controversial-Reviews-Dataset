Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, without a doubt\\, the worst Star Wars movie ever.  The plot is lazy\\, and the dialogue is ridiculous.  They took these brilliant new actors\\, Boyega\\, Isaac\\, Ridley and made them be a part of this pile of garbage.  I was in a theater where people cheered and swooned and gasped...all as a function of their nostalgia.  It didn't matter that they were watching a bad movie\\, if it was self-referential and contained cameos.  Rent it if you feel you must watch it\\, but prepare to be disappointed by this addition to the canon of Star Wars.","true":true}
