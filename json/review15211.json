Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the film but it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm a big fan of the Star Wars movie but the first 2\/3 of the movie were just boring. The casino part was pointless and most of the new characters are easily forgettable.","true":true}
