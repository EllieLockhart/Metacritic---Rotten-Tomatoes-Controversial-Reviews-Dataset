Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand why critics loved this movie so much. Mark H\\, Adam D\\, the cinematography\\, and the building relationship between Kylo and Rey were great. Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Leia\\, and script were okay. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY\\, the one thing I've been waiting for since they announced the Force Awaken\\, never happened. No grand battle to send off Luke. No setting him up to be totally awesome in the future.All I wanted was an amazing fight scene and I would have forgiven the few shortfalls and long drawn out script. So I'll never see Luke shoot green lightning bolts from his fingertips like in the comics\\, I'll never see him fly\\, or do any other cool stuff that I hoped for. Instead\\, all we got was an illusion. AHHHH. So mad. Remember the first time we saw Yoda fight...that's all I wanted. Was it that hard?","true":true}
