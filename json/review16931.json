Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I originally gave this two stars\\, but upon seeing it again\\, the jokes fall flat and nothing keeps this story afloat. It\u2019s one big\\, bloated Twinkie \u2014 seems to offer sustenance to the hungry fan\\, but ultimately only has a short burst of energy followed by a crashing let down. I can\u2019t believe they gave this director the keys to the next generation. If you call yourself a true Star Wars fan and love this movie\\, you have never understood good story writing. Perhaps it\u2019s time to admit you\u2019re just in love with the idea of watching action figures being moved around on a screen for 2.5 hours","true":true}
