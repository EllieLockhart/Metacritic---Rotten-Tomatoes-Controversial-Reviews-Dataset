Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a very solid entry into the Star Wars universe and not afraid to introduce new ideas to familiar concepts. Unfortunately\\, I felt it was too long and had an entire subplot which was ultimately pretty much superfluous. The actors were great\\, I liked the themes\\, most of the humour and the sfx were\\, as you would expect\\, brilliant. Make sure you know what's happened in at least The Force Awakens and ideally in IV\\, V & VI as well if you want to have a scooby what's going on though.","true":true}
