Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"cheesy\\, long\\, unnecessary\\, goofy in a bad way\\, chaotic\\, boring and I liked all the other star wars movies for the most part and I don't care about the lore of star wars so I didn't care if they strayed from it. all around HORRIBLE MOVIE. I wish I had those THREE HOURS BACK.","true":true}
