Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This didn't feel like a standalone movie. Just an extension of the last. Too many coincidences that just felt they were created to justify the plot. It had some moments I liked but alot I disagree with and seems like a poor direction for the trilogy.","true":true}
