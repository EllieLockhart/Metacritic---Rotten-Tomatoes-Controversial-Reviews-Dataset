Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4.1\/5\\n\\nI feel The Last Jedi exists in a tough spot in time\\, as it doesnt truly hold as much hype as The Force Awakens\\, neither does it stand strongly as the \\\"second one\\\" or the \\\"one after the meh Rogue One\\\"\\, but even with its clear minor flaws regarding comedy and narrative choices\\, particularly with a slow first half\\, The Last Jedi still manages to express all the Star Wars energy it needs and more\\, as it continues a story riddled with powerful and emotional moments\\, as well as plenty of twists and shifts in dynamics that\\, at least personally\\, remind me of how awesome and significant the franchise is as a whole.","true":true}
