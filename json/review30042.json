Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruin starwars with this BS movie\\, even Anakin needs training\\, and Kylo\\, but not Rei\\, she is so powerful\\, without any reason. They destroy Luke character\\, Finn and Rose are boring\\, Del Toro was a waste.","true":true}
