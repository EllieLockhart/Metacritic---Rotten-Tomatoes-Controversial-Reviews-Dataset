Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stupendous. The very twists are simply so unpredictable\\, and while many may be disappointed about its insanely fast-paced events and it's unique approach\\, the scenes more than make up for it.","true":true}
