Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A combination of world-breaking elements\\, written by someone who seemingly has no interest in the Star Wars universe -- and lecturing\\, boring\\, joy-killing postmodernism.  This movie made me hate my own beloved childhood.","true":true}
