Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like the way Luke Skywalker was envisioned by this director. His character was never like that. I can see why Mark Hamill had his doubts about the direction this film was going. Overall\\, the film was ok\\, just not great. When you've seen the original films when they first came out\\, it's alot to live up to. Hopefully the next film will be better.","true":true}
