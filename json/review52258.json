Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A garbage movie. Sure the production quality was good\\, and John Williams' familiar score was good\\, but it just trashes the story arc that might have been. The first 20 minutes makes the end of The Force Awakens underwhelming. In fact the victory at the end of Return of the Jedi has no meaning because of this plot arc. All the characters preach through the whole movie\\, and no meaningful action takes place. This is by far the worst thing to happen to Star Wars save for the Christmas Special. I'm getting rid of my copy of The Force Awakens and pretending this story line no longer exists.","true":true}
