Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In their new article this movie has been claimed to have a 106% critic approval rating with RT's wonderful Bayesian formula. If you applied the same formula to it's audience rating\\, it would go below 0%.\\n\\nI understand the complaints cover every facet of this amateur\\, film festival reject but at least Kylo Ren is great in this movie\\, in my eyes redeemed from the last movie. \\n\\nNone of the plot holes hold a candle to the poor directing choices; the inability to use tension or climaxes\\, inability to move the story or have important events happen or build characters or their motivations. If you've ever heard that music is the heart of a memorable film then you will be disappointed there too.\\n\\nNothing happens\\, everything in the movie had no point\\, it's harder to believe with every small bit of reflection on the film.","true":true}
