Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always been a big fan of the Star Wars Movies and this one did not disappoint. I really liked seeing the further character development of Rey and Kylo. It was quite interesting to see the spark of hope that still exists inside the resistance and I'm curious to see how the new First Order and Resistance play our. I do hope that Disney doesn't turn it into some tragic hopeless love story between Kylo and Rey because this is not at all what a Star Wars movie is about. I was a little disappointed to see that Luke Skywalker had to die after his incredible performance. He truly portrayed the power of the Force with his battle between him and Kylo Ren and I was blown away at that scene. I have to give Disney props to their incredible score\\, the music was so fitting and they did a perfect job displaying how powerful Music or lack their of can do to a scene. I am looking forward to the next one\\, and I am sad to see so many other audience members hated it. I have a feeling the next one will be even better and we will see a rise of new Star Wars battles and stories to be told that were left hidden for so many years.","true":true}
