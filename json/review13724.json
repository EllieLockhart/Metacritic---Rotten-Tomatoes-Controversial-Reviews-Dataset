Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it was a Star Wars movie with a Star Wars theme that was Universal for all race sex anything it'd be worth something but I don't go to movies to see a political or personal bullcrap message especially one that degrades women and makes them look like pathetic fools thousands of movies with strong female leads in it and yet Star Wars can't pull it off because of a feminist that's irony for you","true":true}
