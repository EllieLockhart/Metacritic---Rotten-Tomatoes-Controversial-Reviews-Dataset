Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. Every prequel was the worst thing that ever happened and ruined their childhoods\\, Rogue One was too grim\\, The Force Awakens was too similar to the originals\\, Last Jedi was too different from the originals\\, a lot of people hate Return of the Jedi for having Ewoks and a second Death Star. Some of the internet hate this time around is stemming from the alt-right types that are mad that it stars a woman and a black man\\, but aside from that it's business as usual.\\n\\nIf you'd like to see a Star Wars movie that adds to the mythos\\, defies expectations\\, surprises you as strongly as Empire Strikes Back did\\, gives Luke Skywalker a full story arc and upsets all the right people\\, this is the movie you've been waiting for.","true":true}
