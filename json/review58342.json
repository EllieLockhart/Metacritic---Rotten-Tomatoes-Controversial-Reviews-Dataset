Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A discombobulated\\, overlong and ultimately disappointing film that under the guise of \\\"letting the old die and embracing the New\\\" doesn't actually deliver any substantial modifications to the dynamics of the Star Wars saga\\, leaving its core reason for even existing shallow and pointless.  It misses some perfect opportunities for change by opting instead for superficial alterations\\, ultimately leaving new characters (who don't have much of an emotional arc nor reason to be) in a status quo all too similar to the one found at the beginning of episodes IV or V. All that\\, while trying and failing to bring some sort of emotional punch.\\n\\nThat is what this film ultimately is: a missed opportunity for radical changes.","true":true}
