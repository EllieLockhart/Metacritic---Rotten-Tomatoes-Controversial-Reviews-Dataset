Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not listen to the obviously fake and pumped up reviews saying it was good. This was hands down the worst of the franchise. Not because of the twists\\, or the visuals\\, or the acting\\, but because the story decisions. Jokes we're ill placed\\, characters were not true to themselves\\, and directing was down right awful.","true":true}
