Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m mad or just really sad. I\u2019m leaning towards sad. I can\u2019t believe a film is making me feel like this but I really think Rian Johnson destroyed this franchise. I understand that he wanted to \u201cdo something different and set up a new direction\u201d but isn\u2019t that what your new trilogy is for? Episode 8 should have stayed on the path that was set up in 7. Give the fans what they want. You literally ripped the heart out of so many people. Me included. I know many are saying they won\u2019t watch the new trilogy or episode 9 but I truly won\u2019t. I\u2019m 40 years old and this awful film destroyed one of the most precious memories of my childhood. I feel so bad for Mark Hamill. Sucking on an alien space titty? WTF was that. So degrading and disrespectful to him and the character that basically defined him as an actor. Watching this movie was so confusing. ","true":true}
