Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the original Star Wars in 1977\\, brilliant. I had not seen anything like it before and it is still a respectable film for the time. If this latest installment represents the quality of film we can expect in the future\\, please let this icon die a respectable death and not make anymore. I\u2019ll summarize: Acting: ridiculously poor Story: contrived garbage Willingness to purchase another movie ticket if subsequent films are of this same quality: Nonexistent Stop it Disney ","true":true}
