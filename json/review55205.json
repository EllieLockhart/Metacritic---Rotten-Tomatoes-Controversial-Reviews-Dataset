Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams set Rian Johnson up for a home run of a movie and he absolutely whiffed. He seemed so focused on ensuring no prediction about Snoke\\, Rey\\, or Leia was true that he forgot to include all of the typical characteristics that true Star Wars fans love. A great movie for children\\, thanks to the over-saturation of forced jokes and inclusion of a cute but overdone species of birds. The character Rose\\, has debatably overtaken Jar Jar as the most annoying and unnecessary character in the series. There were so many plot holes in this movie I won't even bother naming them all. The force seems to have no rules or limits any longer and Luke Skywalker's personality somehow immatured during his exile. I enjoyed almost nothing about this movie other than the excellent acting of Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamil\\, and Oscar Isaac. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of how he has tainted one of the greatest stories ever told.","true":true}
