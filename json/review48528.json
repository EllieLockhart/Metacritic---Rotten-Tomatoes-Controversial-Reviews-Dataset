Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wonderful movie continues the legendary Star Wars saga. There are exciting action sequences\\, emotional depths\\, and brave rebels that uplift the narrative. Too bad the mysoginistic and bigoted fan boys can't see beyond their agenda to tear the movie down. Did they not notice that 2 of the 3 main characters are white men? Three generations of my family saw it and loved the latest installment. Especially Adam Driver's powerful performance.  See it and you will enjoy the heart and soul of the force.","true":true}
