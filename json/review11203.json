Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I didn't have a lot of expectations for the movie and it still fell flat. Predictable plot\\, bad philosophy\\, crummy character development\\, horrible pacing made me wish it was over halfway through. The lack of events made this movie almost unwatchable","true":true}
