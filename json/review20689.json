Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I visibly cringed while watching this pile of vomit. Everything sacred was torn down and buried. Subvert expectations is an excuse for gross negligence\\, perhaps even malicious intent. \\nJedi training matters\\, no one is born to the art and skill. Ancient Jedi teachings matter\\, wisdom matters\\, no knowledge should be burned. Murder is not the Jedi way\\, especially of unarmed individuals presumed guilty before innocent. Credible character arcs are born of flawed journeys. Giant characters built up over time should not be eliminated in ridiculous and implausible manners\\, without adequate back story and closure. \\nI was emotionally detached from this mess\\, and retained no affinity or attraction. It is utterly unwatchable\\, even repulsive. I have never witnessed such a rabid and rapid destruction of a franchise. Subvert expectations indeed\\, the expectation that Star Wars is reborn or has a future. ","true":true}
