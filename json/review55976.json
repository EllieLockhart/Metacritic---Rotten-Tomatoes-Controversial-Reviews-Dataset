Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined Star Wars forever. I've been a lifelong fan. I had all the action figures growing up (during the remastered original trilogy release). All the toys. I played the shit out of SWTOR\\, read expanded universe material (Shadows of the Empire\\, The Thrawn trilogy) and some graphic novels. Watched all of Clone Wars cartoon series (never got around to Rebels). I'm a defender of the prequels. However\\, I will NOT be seeing the 9th entry of the Sykwalker series in theaters. Disneys has irrevocably ruined this universe. Luke Skywalker's character arc was completely destroyed (and made no sense)\\, weaponized lightspeed negates all warfare in the universe as we've known it\\, and none of the women in the movie eared their abilies\/power (asian chick\\, purple-hair chick\\, Mary-Sue Rey\\, Mary-Poppins Leia). If I mentioned everything wrong with this movie I'd be here all day and this post would be a novel. I will say\\, it looked awesome. That's the only kind thing I have to say. If you're distracted by shiny objects and don't care about the Star Wars Universe at all\\, then give this movie a watch. Otherwise\\, please don't give Disney your money. Rian Johnson can go to hell.","true":true}
