Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a disappointment. I was invited to see it again for free and I had to decline. I don't want anything to do with this movie anymore after seeing it. I hate that it's apart of this trilogy..especially after such a great start with The Force Awakens. Even Rogue One was a good movie. The Last Jedi was just not good at all. Felt like a side quest movie where everything was pointless ","true":true}
