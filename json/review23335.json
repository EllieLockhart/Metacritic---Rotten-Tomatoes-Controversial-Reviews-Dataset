Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved It !!!  Rian Johnson is masterful.  One of my favorite Star Wars movie. It wasn't what I expected but I got what I needed.  Hats off to Mark Hamilton and the late Carrie Fisher best performance ever.  The Last Jedi gives the audience a fresh new take on the force.","true":true}
