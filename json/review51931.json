Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fi;m that divides the fan base needs no explanation  to say the movie could be better and suffers from severe issues. While it may not be the worst film ever created it certainly is the worst Star Wars film ever made.\\n\\nDon't trust critics on this one\\, remember Critics never liked Lucas\\, in his time making Star Wars. We didn't need them then. We don't need them now.","true":true}
