Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I seriously mean that. The plot is non existent and makes no sense. The side plot has no impact on the actual plot and accomplishes nothing. The scene with Leia flying in like Mary Poppins is laughable. The movie abandons everything from episode 7 (also a bad movie). For example\\, who is Snoke? Idk let's just kill him. Who are Rey's parents? Obi Wan? Luke? Neh\\, no one. Also\\, they ruin Luke Skywalker and are not consistent with his character (Mark Hamil even says this). Luke refuses to kill Vader because he sees the slight good in him but attempts to murder his nephew because he might turn evil? No way\\, not the hero we know and love. I could go on and on but you get the point. At this point the only way episode 9 could win me over is if they start the movie with \\\"it was all just a dream...\\\"","true":true}
