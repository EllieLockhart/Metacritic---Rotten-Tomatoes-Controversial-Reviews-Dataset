Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think all of the negative audience reviews come from the prequel generation who expect Star Wars movies to be nothing but lightsaber duels and cartoonish dialogue. There hasn\u2019t been an episode like this since The Empire Strikes Back which elevated Star Wars into science fiction mastery. The prequels nearly knocked the franchise into buffoonery. Granted Benecio Del Toro was a wasted effort. No major questions were answered. But there\u2019s still a third installment. As sad and tragic as it was\\, The Last Jedi was about the passing of the Jedi torch to a new generation. I can\u2019t remember a Star Wars movie that made feel a wide range of emotions. If you want cliche and the \u201csame old-same old\u201d than you won\u2019t like this film. I\u2019m from the Original Trilogy generation so the ending broke my heart. But I respect and love this bold new direction.","true":true}
