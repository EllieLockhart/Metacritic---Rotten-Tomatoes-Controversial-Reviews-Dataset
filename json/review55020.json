Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand that die-hard Star Wars fans are in general upset about this movie\\, and the casual viewers have\\, in general\\, praised this film. I myself land right in the middle of the spectrum; I enjoy Star Wars but wouldn\u2019t consider myself a huge \u201cfan\u201d. That being said I took this movie and the other films from Star Wars as they were and found this episode to be flawed through and through. I left the theater dissatisfied and confused. The storyline was poorly written\\, some of the characters oftentimes made choices that were \u201cout-of-character\u201d\\, and the frequent use of bathos humor (which oftentimes failed to get a laugh from the audience) made this film ultimately fall flat. I respect that Rian Johnson wanted to take risks with this latest installment of the franchise\\, however the film somehow feels even more formulaic than its predecessors as it seemed to follow a modern\\, familiar \u201cDisney-ism\u201d template. While some moments were legitimately cool\\, it does not make up for the mess and the lack of substance in the plot. I will mostly likely not see this again and I hope that episode 9 can improve upon this story which\\, I believe\\, leads the Star Wars saga nowhere. ","true":true}
