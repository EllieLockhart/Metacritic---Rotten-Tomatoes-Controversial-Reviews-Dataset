Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe not quite as good as Episode 7\\, but still a very good movie in a great series.More than 40 years after I saw A New Hope in theaters\\, this movie made me laugh and cry just like the original!","true":true}
