Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was different and killed off characters such as smoke who had not been explained but took risks in killing Luke it was not the  best way to kill him off the best and most powerful characters in the saga but it was still exiting it contained amazing fighting scenes good character building although they the way they built roses and Finn characters was awful and could have been cut it was there to take us away from the story for a bit I thought killing snake was a bad idea but progressed kylo rens character well as becoming a leader I thought the force ghost with Luke was amazing only wish it was actually Luke although this leaves many plot wholes if fixed right in episode 9 will become a great movie in the saga","true":true}
