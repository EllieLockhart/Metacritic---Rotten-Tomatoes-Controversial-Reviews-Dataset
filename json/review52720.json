Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the work that Luke\\, Leia and Han put into building a better future is completely undone by this movie. Everything they accomplished in the original trilogy is made to be for nothing. Even if you judge this movie on its own\\, there are so many plot holes it is hard to enjoy it.","true":true}
