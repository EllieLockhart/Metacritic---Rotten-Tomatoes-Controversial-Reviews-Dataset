Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Introduced a few new characters and new aspects of the force. Great twists and turns and entertainment value.There are things in the film for every generation of Star Wars fan. The movie did the best with the situation The Force Awakens gave it. Giving us an interesting centerpiece leaving us hungering for episode 9. It's certainly one of the best Star Wars films.","true":true}
