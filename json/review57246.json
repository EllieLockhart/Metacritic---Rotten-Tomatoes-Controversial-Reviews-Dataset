Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie feels like Rian Johnson secretly hated JJ Abrams previous movie.\\nThe Last Jedi repeatedly negates or ignores everything that The Force Awakes left us excited for.\\nIt contains gaping critical plot holes that will leave you wondering how much cocaine was involved in the making of this movie.how","true":true}
