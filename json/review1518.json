Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a kid we used to play a game where someone would draw a face\\, then fold the paper over and someone else would draw the body\\, repeating until a group of people had created a weird mishmash figure...Now what makes a fun game does not make for a fun trilogy where some continuity of plot and character is needed to sustain interest and engagement.\\n\\nIn fact\\, thinking about it\\, TLJ doesn't even follow this incoherent approach as it deliberately destroys the cliff hangers from TFA. To do this once might be \\\"subversive\\\" and clever but to repeat it for every single one is not clever and certainly not subversive.\\n\\nPossibly the biggest crime of the TLJ is that u leave feeling apathetic to not only any future movies but also to the tragic arc of EP1-3 and the heroic \/ redemption arc of 4-6.\\n\\nNot going to mention the ridiculous plot as this has been to death.","true":true}
