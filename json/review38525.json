Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie. As a die hard fan I'm deeply disappointed. Ryan Johnson did a terrible job. A bunch of terrible unnecessary scenes like Luke milking a space cow and spear fishing? give me a break. Yoda looked nothing like himself. Snoke's scene had so much potential and they totally ruined it. Kylo's flip flops leave a teenage boy in charge of the dark side? They couldn't have done a worse job","true":true}
