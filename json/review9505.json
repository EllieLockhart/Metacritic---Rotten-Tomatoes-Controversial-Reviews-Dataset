Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good\\, but it missed the point of twist and answers. I feel that The Force Awakens was way better. It had a better hype to it. This movie is all over the place\\, great sci fi film but doesnt feel much like star wars. Its slow yet fast if that makes sense\\, I hope JJ comes back and fixes this problem with episode 9. Good scifi film and space battles but not a great story as far as star wars goes. Ep 1\\,2\\,3 are better than this.","true":true}
