Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a huge disappointment. The Force Awakens created so many opportunities and Last Jedi wasted most if not all of them. Disney did a good job with Rogue One and Force Awakens. Without giving spoilers\\, I can say this:\\nToo many characters\\, subplot merely for social commentary\\, odd humor\\, and anticlimactic answers to the questions raised in The Force Awakens. Minus 1 star each for those things. The 1 star given is for the action sequences which aren't bad. So many plot elements don't make sense. I truly cannot image how this script advanced through Disney's creative teams. It is 100% understandable to attempt to phase out the original cast and chart new territory\\, but this is a mess. Hopefully\\, the next film can pick up the pieces and have a plot that is worthy of the series.","true":true}
