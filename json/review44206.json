Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tons of Easter eggs\\, Some of the wrap ups of plot lines are very\\, almost too easy. But remember there are children and adults with little to no Star Wars experience watching the movie too\\, and the film can not be created solely for us veteran nerds. \\nThat being said some very emotional scenes probably won't sit best with sociopaths and comicbook guy wannabes.\\n\\nOne of the best scenes... less is more.","true":true}
