Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My TLDR review:  If you are a Star Wars fan you aren't going to like this movie.  If you more \\\"general audience\\\" you may enjoy it.  \\n\\nAs a standalone movie Last Jedi would be at best an average sci-fi film with decent action.  There are some plot holes and the comedy was a bit in your face\\, so much so that it can take you out of the movie.  Within the existing lore established by the previous movies and countless other media this film simply doesn't work.  Two of the central messages of the film are all of the people you thought were heroes are actually failures and some people are simply irredeemably evil.","true":true}
