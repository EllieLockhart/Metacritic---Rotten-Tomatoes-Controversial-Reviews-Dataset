Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the second half of TFA this movie is okay. As the eighth episode in a saga this movie does not do enough. I see people saying the low scores are \\\"fanboys who don't like change.\\\" No\\, the new direction of the films was already set by episode 7. The changes were already there. People were willing to see what this new Star Wars had in store. This film answered: not much\\, almost nothing happened between TFA and the end of TLJ. That is why people are upset.","true":true}
