Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Superb film. One of the best to date. Been watching these since the 70's and this brought the franchise back to the quality we enjoyed with New Hope\\, Empire and ROTJ. Looking forward to watching it again. ??","true":true}
