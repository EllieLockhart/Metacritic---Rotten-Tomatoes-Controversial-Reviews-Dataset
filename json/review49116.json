Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, so many things make no sense at all. I can't possibly list all of my reasons so here are a few:\\n\\nLuke leaves a trail of breadcrumbs and data in R2 so he can be found in Force Awakens\\, so when we find him in this movie he doesn't want to be found? Why did he leave the trail then?\\n\\nThe hacker betrays them and Finn is captured\\, Poe is the only one who is in contact with Finn\\, Poe knows nothing about the stealth ships and does not tell Finn about them\\, how does the hacker know about the stealth ships?\\n\\nIf they can contact some one to ask about how to hack a star destroyer\\, why can't they call for reinforcements?\\n\\nAnd I can't not mention the milking scene... they built then helecoptered that puppet out to the Island\\, so many rescources for something that was a complete waste of time.","true":true}
