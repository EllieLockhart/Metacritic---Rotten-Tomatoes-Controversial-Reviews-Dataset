Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two words: Flying Leia. It's truly a line in the sand. After seeing that cringey\\, embarrassing\\, disrespectful scene you are either in\\, or out. And I'm out. Fans have put up with a lot of nonsense in the prequels\\, Abrams' movie bought back a LOT of goodwill. This film takes a two and a half hour bowel movement on something that many people loved from their childhood.","true":true}
