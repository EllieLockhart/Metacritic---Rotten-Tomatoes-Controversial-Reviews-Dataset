Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie literally destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker\\, plus a lot of plot holes within itself.  The movie tried to use a lot of misdirection too much to the point the story overall was horrible.  Rose loses her sister\\, then dooms every rebel her sister died for because of one guy she wanted to kiss\\, totally retarded\\, amongst other things.","true":true}
