Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I absolutly adored this game and wish it never ended.The 7 year wait was well worth it for me. The story is heart wrenching and does a brilliant job of quite literally showing two sides of the story. It also shed light on our own biases\\, as fans of the first game probably found themselves rooting for Ellie even though she isn't necessarily the good guy in this tale (there probably wasn't one. Maybe Lev.)The graphics and worlds are so gorgeous and immersive\\, and the game mechanics are sufficient albeit maybe a little aged.I am so frustrated at the 0 scores on here. There is no conceivable way that this game deserves those user reviews\\, even if people didn't find the story enjoyable - the world and graphics are enough to warrant a couple points.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
