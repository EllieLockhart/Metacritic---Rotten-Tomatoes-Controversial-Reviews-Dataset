Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up for Rotten Tomatoes just to post my dissappointment for this movie. I have never posted a review of any movie before\\, but this had to be done. If for nothing else but to just add my voice to growing dissent for this movie. This is not our Star Wars anymore my fellow fans and it never will be again. This episode\\, we'll call TLJ from here on out\\, has killed the franchise for me. Someone who grew up the the films and has read every other piece of the EU of Star Wars. I don't understand how such a successful franchise could so completely ignore the story lines that have kept the heart of Star Wars alive for so long. When no movies were being made or thought of\\, many great writers were carrying the story and keeping Stars War alive. I feel very sad for Mark Hamill\\, knowing he has to live with the way Luke was portrayed in this episode. As he has said\\, this is not my Luke Skywalker. To go from hero\\, savior\\, and rebuilder of the jedi order\\, to someone who can't get off any island to do the right thing is blasphemy. I have no problem with and support the expanded role of women in this episode as some have said they do have a problem with. As true fans know there have been many strong and important females in the EU of Star Wars. From Leia\\, her daughter Jaina\\, to Luke's wife Mara Jade (aka The Hand). But the latter two women are lost to us never to be known. I highly recommend to you all to read the \\,Thrawn Trilogy\\, by Timothy Zahn. This trilogy is what should have been episodes 7\\, 8\\, and 9. \\nSo much is wrong with new episode it's hard to wrap my head around it all. The fact Luke spends the entire movie on an island\\, to the ridiculous trip Fin took to that gambling planet\\, to the non-reveal of who Snoak is\\, and so much more. \\nI ususally see new Star Wars movies at least twice in theaters\\, but I may not even buy the movie when it comes out on DVD\\, it's that dissappointing. After the failure during the second week of release\\, I predict episode 9 will not even come close to the record. Disney should stick to these in between movies\\, like Rogue One\\, and the upcoming Han Solo flick. At least those will be subject to sticking to the original canon of Star Wars.","true":true}
