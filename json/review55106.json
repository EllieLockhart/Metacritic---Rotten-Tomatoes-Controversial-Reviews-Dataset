Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed at first. Then I tried really really hard to convince myself that it was good. I didn't want to believe a Star Wars film could be bad. But eventually\\, after many months\\, my self-denial fell apart and I had to admit this film isn't just bad\\, it killed Star Wars forever. It's so bad\\, Disney can't come back from it now\\, it's impossible. There are a thousand reasons why this film is bad\\, but I'll just go with number one: We waited 40 years to see Luke as a great Jedi Master\\, and they spent all of The Force Awakens searching for him because he is so important. But then Rian Johnson spent all of The Last Jedi making Luke a worthless joke of a character that never mattered\\, ever. Also\\, the rampant sexism and racism is disturbing. Everything Rey has\\, she stole from men\\, she didn't earn anything\\, making it seem the writers didn't believe women are capable of being a great character on thier own. They also made Finn an absolute joke of a character\\, a janitor even. And by shredding every thread left by The Force Awakens\\, it retroactively made TFA worse and also broke the Disney Trilogy. So\\, now we have to ignore everything Star Wars after 2012. All good things come to an end eventually\\, I guess 35 years was a pretty good run to be honest.","true":true}
