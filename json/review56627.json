Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is unlike any Star Wars film you have ever seen. The action is nearly non-stop from beginning to end. There is some great character moments that made you believe that Rian Johnson was bringing a fresh and different perspective into the Star Wars universe and there is various points through out the movie that can be very funny. With all that said\\, this does not feel like a Star Wars movie. The comedy is tonally off for a Star Wars movie and feels like a Guardians of the Galaxy - Star Wars hybrid. The character arcs that were developed in TFA are not clearly answered and leave the viewer grasping for more. I'd say the thing that is the most jarring is the pacing. Everybody was talking at lightspeed\\, like I turned my podcast speed to 2x and (vice one incredible scene) the moments didn't stick with you. I left this movie with far more questions than answers\\, which for a middle movie in a Star Wars trilogy should never be an issue. I can't drop it into prequel territory but this ranks 5th in my ranks of Star Wars Episodes.I can see why its been universally praised but not ym cup of tea. I love Rian Johnson and his prior work\\, but I'm interested to see how JJ Abrams decides to close this series. #StarWars #TheLastJedi","true":true}
