Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. What can I say about this film? After The Force Awakens\\, I was extremely excited about where this newest trilogy was headed. Some criticized TFA for being too similar to A New Hope. While I could certainly appreciate that\\, I loved the movie and was excited about where the next movie would go. What has Luke Skywalker been up to? Who is this Snoke character? How did the First Order come to power? What's Rey's connection to the force and who are her parents? What about the Knights of Ren? \\n\\nThis film is basically a bait and switch. It seems like Rian Johnson took all of JJ's ideas and just threw them in the trash. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement. My wife hated the movie. My 6 year old son (HUGE Star Wars fan) was so let down. \\\"Dad\\, I didn't like that one\\, it was boring.\\\" That's from a child. But the worst part was the complete bastardization of the Luke Skywalker character. After seeing the movie\\, I now know why Mark Hamill feels the way he does about Rian Johnson's \\\"vision\\\" for the series. For the first time in my life\\, I will NOT be seeing a Star Wars movie in theaters for multiple viewings. Worse yet\\, I have absolutely no desire to see Episode IX. I will probably just catch it on video. I just don't care what happens next. If that's what you were going for\\, Disney\\, you nailed it.","true":true}
