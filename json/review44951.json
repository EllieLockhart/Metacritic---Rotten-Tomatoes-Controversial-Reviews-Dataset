Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh. The fun\\, lighthearted space opera of the 70s is officially dead. Crushed under the weight of its own self-perceived importance and horrific acting. Plot? You've seen it all before - rebels gotta sneak onto the big bad ship to turn off some doohickey. Luke does chuck his lightsaber over his shoulder\\, so there's that.","true":true}
