Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it today I loved it ( except for the 25 minutes I missed taking my kids to the bathroom 4 times) My husband was \\\"so-so\\\" on it. I think it moved the franchise forward and I am excited to see where it goes next.","true":true}
