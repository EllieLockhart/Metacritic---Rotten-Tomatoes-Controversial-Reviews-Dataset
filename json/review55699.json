Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies of star wars saga in terms of entertaiment. You won\u00b4t find a deep development of the force concept and jedi religion\\, but is full of action and fun. I felt disappointed with some expectatios I had\\, but I eventually understood the decisions in therms of film internal coherence. Despite being a fan since the 70s and hating prequels a bit\\, I have an open mind about new ideas in the saga. If you're a Star Wars religious fan and you expect the movie to go in a certain direction\\, you probably will not like it.","true":true}
