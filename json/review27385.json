Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Our family found it very entertaining and loved how the mixture of the old cast and new cast worked out so well. The acting\\, music\\, action\\, and pace were great in our estimation. Yes there are a few flaws\\, but overall it was really fun. The franchise will continue. Long live the force!","true":true}
