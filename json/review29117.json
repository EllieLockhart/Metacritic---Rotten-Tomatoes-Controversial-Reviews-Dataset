Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really some people thinks this is a Star Wars movie?\\nThe original Story is about the Skywalkers\\, if you want to Watch a movie about pass the torch to a new generation\\, this is your chance but if you love the original Star Wars Characters avoid this mess","true":true}
