Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" No spoilers here but I saw the original Star Wars opening day and have been a huge fan ever since\\, but this watered-down Walt Disney version with horrendous dialogue. plot flaws\\, plastic-power-ranger-looking armor\\, and head-scratching action scenes just killed it. Even Mark Hamill hated it. ","true":true}
