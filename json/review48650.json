Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Film I have sEEN in a long time. Tearing apart the legacy of the series. Doesn't follow the universe's own rules\\, characters are either new and garbage or old\\, miss representative\\, and killed off. My favourite film series has been ruined. Don't support this atrocity.","true":true}
