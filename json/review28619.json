Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Profoundly disappointing.   Episode VII and VIII disrespect the characters\\, story\\, and spirit of the original Star Wars trilogy.  The original trilogy characters should have just been left out of these new movies altogether\\, instead of being misused as something they are not.  \\n\\nThe new Disney Star Wars movies have been pointless and tedious\\, and just feel like a commercial for merchandise and the next film in the now endless franchise.   These films are to be cast aside as \\\"legends\\,\\\" just as Disney was quick to do with the original expanded universe novels.","true":true}
