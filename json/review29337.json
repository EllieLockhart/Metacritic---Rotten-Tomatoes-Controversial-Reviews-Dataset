Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson basically took the Episode 7 movie plot points and threw them out the window. Sometimes\\, I\u2019m trying to make a movie unique and disprove all the fan theories\\, you end up making a movie that is so convoluted that it doesn\u2019t follow even the same general direction as the previous movie. Effects and acting in this movie were good\\, so I can\u2019t give this movie 1 star. However\\, this is one of the worst stories of a movie I have ever seen. I would go into details\\, but I will avoid spoilers.","true":true}
