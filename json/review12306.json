Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am simply stunned by the critics' reviews--no doubt some received special \\\"gift\\\" packages from Disney.  I can only echo all the other negative reviews on this site\\, Twitter\\, Facebook\\, and Youtube.  Last Jedi was an overhyped movie with numerous plot holes\\, inconsistencies\\, and cringe-worthy moments.  Ladies and gentleman\\, be prepared to see a beloved character suckling from a creature's teet and another flying through space like Superman--I am not making this up.  I sincerely question whether test audiences screened this movie.  My high expectations were crushed and I left the theatre feeling disappointed.  I don't plan to see Last Jedi a second time and wonder if a recovery is possible with episode IX.","true":true}
