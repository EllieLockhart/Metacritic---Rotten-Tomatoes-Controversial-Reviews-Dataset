{"101487":188990,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLDR: Star Wars: The Last Jedi is awful.\\n\\nHoly fuck. I gave Force Awakens the benefit of the doubt\\, and felt it had some great scenes with some decent lines\\, but Last Jedi is an unfocused\\, confused\\, mess. Anyone who compares this film to Empire Strikes Back needs to re-watch the movie and then shoot themselves. The Last Jedi's lack of direction makes the film tedious and tiring to get through. There are too many characters and side plots happening that you don't even know who the protagonist is. Whats worse\\, is half way through the film\\, you don't even know who the antagonist is either\\, which leaves the audience wondering who to root for and who to root against. The movie wants to attempt to make characters gray and complex\\, but instead what you have is all your wires in a tangle with no clue on to where they end up. If you feel confused\\, or hated this movie\\, its probably because the people behind it were just as confused as you were.\\n\\n((SPOILERS))-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYOU DON'T KILL OFF YOUR ANTAGONISTS HALF WAY THROUGH THE 2ND MOVIE OF A TRILOGY.\\n\\nAll the tension is lost. There's no longer an imposing force to challenge your protagonist. In order for people to be worried about your main characters\\, you have to throw something terrifying in their way\\, an enemy or object or even an inner conflict that could tear them apart. But here in this movie\\, they've removed that\\, and all tension is gone. Instead of hoping your character's conquer a storm\\, they're now riding a paddle boat across an empty pond.\\n\\nThe movie doesn't know when to be serious\\, or when to be funny. I don't know why all of today's movies have to have EVERY character say some funny line\\, but it ruins the tension of what otherwise should be a scary or dramatic moment. Having a character display a powerful act of violence\\, only for it to be belittled by a snappy come back completely deflates their character\\, and makes them look like a clown. The problem with the Last Jedi is it does this with every character. It makes it feel like nobody takes these characters seriously\\, but then turns around and tries to tell everyone \\\"Hey were powerful and could kill you\\, stop laughing at me.\\\" Stories need curtain characters who are serious 100% of the time. It needs characters who are sticks in the mud\\, or characters that are seen as a threat. Dramatic speeches and moments are ruined by this\\, because once you've heard someone make fun of Kylo Ren in the movie\\, your audience starts making fun of them\\, and now when Kylo Ren is supposed to face off against one of the main characters in a serious manner\\, the audience laughs at him\\, because even the movie doesn't take him seriously. Its stupid. Marvel is guilty of this too\\, and requiring every character to have a funny or goofy scene needs to STOP.\\n\\nI could go into detail about all the little plot holes that just make this movie even more stupid\\, but those are irreverent. I could honestly forgive most of those\\, if the story didn't feel so unfocused. Stories need a begging\\, middle\\, and end\\, but this movie felt like it had several middles\\, several beginnings\\, and no resolution. There are about 7 plots going on at the same time in this movie\\, and its tiring. You can tell that this movie was made by people in a board meeting and not one sole director. This movie wanted to simply check points off a list\\, and because of that\\, you don't have one consistent story\\, but instead several confusing ones\\, and they don't mesh together well at all.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, this movie needed one passionate man behind the camera\\, but its obvious you have several corporate people in suits making it. Everything feels so artificial\\, and it shows. The old Star Wars movies were made from a love of many things\\, old sci-fi serials\\, samurai films\\, spaghetti westerns\\, etc. But this movie was made as a product\\, and unfortunately we're all going to see it anyways.\\n\\nFuck this movie. Anyone who says this is comparable to Empire Strikes Back is wrong\\, and if you like this movie\\, your opinion is wrong and you don't know shit about why people love Star Wars.","true":true}
