Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is quite good. It tells the story in a good fast-paced rhythm with some twists and turns along the way! In other words the last jedi is another epic star wars film with star wars-esq storylines and situations\\, it's very good.","true":true}
