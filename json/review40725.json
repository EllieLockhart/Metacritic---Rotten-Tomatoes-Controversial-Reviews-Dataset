Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may be my new favorite. A happy departure from the stories we've already been told\\, the story is fresh and exciting. At times\\, the significance of what is happening is played down in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously\\, a mistake I'm glad they avoided in this sophomore in the trilogy.","true":true}
