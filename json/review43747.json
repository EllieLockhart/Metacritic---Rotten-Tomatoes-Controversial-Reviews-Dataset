Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worse piece of garbage disappointment let down ever! I'm not sure how else to sum it up other than that I was so hoping to love this but the second Princess Leia flew through space it was over the plot was a disaster how anyone can support liking this piece of trash I cannot understand!","true":true}
