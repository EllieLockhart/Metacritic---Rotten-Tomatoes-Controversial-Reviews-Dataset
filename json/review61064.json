It was a clear disappointment overall and I felt like I was watching an 80's b flick made into playable form. The story was a simple revenge story with no revenge resulting in an unfulfilled journey without a payoff. After killing hundreds of infected and human to just turn around and not finish the journey off because to not repeat the cycle doesn't make sense in this apocalyptic world. The theme doesn't match with the theme of the world. A shoehorned idea just to milk out money.\rGraphically it's great. Controller and the game play is redundant from it's first iteration.\rIt's appreciative to show inclusion with an asian kid\\, lbgqt and what not. But not allowing us to kill off the antagonist because of the so called inclusion didn't do anything to make it progressive\\, more like. since it's an inclusion. It's got plot armor.\rIn the end\\, not something to spend your money on right now\\, but later when it's nearly free to buy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
