Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there were moments it felt like a Star Wars movie\\, overall this film is a huge disappointment. After Rogue One\\, which was horrible\\, I had a bad feeling about this one going into the movie theatre. Turnes out\\, it was justified. Even the great acting skills of the actors and the nice camerawork could not outweigh the badly written screenplay\\, the cheesy dialogues\\, the poorly formed characters and those ridiculous scenes (Luke and the blue milk\\, really?) that should have been cut and hidden somewhere never to be seen.\\nI used to be a huge SW fan\\, and as far as I'm concerned\\, Star Wars 1-6 was the real deal\\, the rest is Disney Wars. Am I interested in IX or the Solo thingy? Absolutely not. Time to move along. So\\, move along.","true":true}
