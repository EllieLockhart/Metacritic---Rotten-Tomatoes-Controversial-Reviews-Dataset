{"101487":134579,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-11-04","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like Daisy Ridley as the face of the new star wars trilogy\\, she's very proper\\, reminds me of Keira Knightley but if Keira Knightley did weights and couldn't act so good\\, in that sense she reminds me of Arnie\\, or Sylvester Stallone\\, or Grace Jones\\, but what she lacks in delivery she more than makes up with force and perfect elocution.\\n\\nBut brawn acting aside this is the most star wars Star Wars movie to date. It's an epic\\, unmissable adventure full of plot twists\\, space battles and lightsabre clashes.\\n\\nIt continues to borrow closet characters\\, movie sets\\, and plot points from the original trilogy\\, however that does add to the feel of the star wars universe\\, and I think The Last Jedi has recovered from a lot of the mistakes of its predecessor The Force Awakens. \\n\\nOne example is Kylo Ren removing the mask to mature from bad boy to Sith dark lord with a heart of pure evil. There are moments when shivers will run down your spine at the site of him on screen. The creation of a dark force is a real accomplishment in this instalment\\, not seen since Anakin went loco at the Jedi kid party in Revenge of The Sith.\\n\\nA really odd point is that there are quite a few references to snuffing people out\\, at first I thought it might be some kind of Nicholas Cage reference but then Carrie Fisher takes a dive in the deep black and the whole cinema is stunned into silence\\, but just as the dark force awakens so does the light and we learn about a whole new dimension of Jedi abilities and mind tricks.\\n\\nThe expansion of Jedi skills is both creative and entertaining; there are further examples of how the force works and some really great scenes demonstrating the full extent of the new force (the norce) in action. Disney superstar Daisy Rey is very keen to find out about the norce and picks up from where she left off; on a yoga retreat in County Kerry learning about becoming a Jedi in three easy lessons. However after lesson two Daisy Rey faces a crossroads when Chewbacca turns Vegan and she has to make a decision before everyone turns full namaste. Finding the balance between dark and hormones Rey rushes off to fight the First Order by herself resulting in a face-off with the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke.\\n\\nSnoke is basically the Emperor\\, but with the lack of a back story\\, a larger army\\, more loyal apprentices\\, stronger powers\\, and a much creepier voice\\, like Snoke is definitely into some weird stuff.\\n\\nMeanwhile back on prayer island Luke is singing songs to the Star Wars puffins (Porgs) & learning how to become one with the Matrix.\\n\\nThere is a lot happening in this movie and it's got a finger in a lot of different pies across the universe\\, there are some preachy lessons about how weapons are sold in mass conflicts\\, about how egomaniacs make poor decisions\\, and about how disposable life outside the Empire really is.\\n\\nThe mantra of the movie appears to be out with the old\\, a message that Star Wars is evolving for a new generation perhaps\\, with new characters and new adventures. The revolution has begun and it's about to get a whole lot bigger with even more inconsequential destruction and mass scale murder that neither makes any sense or makes you feel like there is any purpose to your insignificant existence.","true":true}
