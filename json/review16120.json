Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I may have to amend later\\, but like so many other lifelong fans\\, so many things just don't add up.  It is a gorgeous film in many respects with spectacular action sequences\\, and re-inventive of the mythology.  The acting is superior to almost anything seen in any of the other films\\, Mark Hamill is superb!  Carrie Fisher\\, is good\\, a whole of emotion is evoked watching her final performance with a very special scene toward the end\\, I don't want to spoil for anyone.  Daisy is fantastic\\, and far beyond\\, so are John Boyega and Adam Driver.  Oscar and newcomer Kelly Marie Tran become the heart of this film in so many ways.  All of this being said\\, the film just doesn't follow the right beats with our beloved heroes of old.  It really feels like a heavy push for out with the old\\, in with the new.  I couldn't help\\, but feel that the whole agenda is to prepare people to take part in the new Disney World theme park at the expense of better\\, stronger\\, more true story arcs.  It's as if the filmmakers have forgotten all the lessons learned by our heroes of old\\, and only the children can make it right.  Sorry\\, at this point\\, I have close to no interest in ever watching Star Wars again.  And\\, that is not the feeling a Star Wars movie was ever intended to inspire.  Say what you will about Johnson\\, great at what he does\\, not a real fanboy!  I miss George.  And\\, Hamill got it right\\, I fundamentally disagree.","true":true}
