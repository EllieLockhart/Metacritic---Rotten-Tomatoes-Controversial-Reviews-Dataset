Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They could have done so much\\, but it is just an incomprehensible pile of cr@p. Rian Johnson intentionally added plot twists and surprises\\, but they were nonsensical: he could have added a fire-breathing unicorn to save the galaxy and it would not have been out of place. Previous character development was completely ignored and none acted in any kind of logical or believable way. This movie was not a disappointment: it has destroyed the franchise.","true":true}
