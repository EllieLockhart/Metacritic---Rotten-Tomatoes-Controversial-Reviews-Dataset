Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are an in-depth Star Wars fan who has read The Expanded Universe\\, etc. You will be hugely met disappointment with this film and maybe even so from a new Star Wars fan perspective as well. I'll try to wrap this nicely as I can. There are some amazing moments in this movie. Truly. Those are worth seeing. But this movie as a whole just might be the most disappointing Star Wars release yet. None of the story honestly makes sense and it doesn't tie up anything from the first film. Some of that is uncertain to a degree. But unless they have a giant explanation in the 9th film. It makes no sense. I am not going to spoil this for anyone. Go see it for yourself and make your own judgement. It's definitely worth watching. However\\, what they did to Luke's character was a travesty in some ways and even Mark Hamil said\\, he didn't like the new direction they took Luke but was happy to play him or something to that effect. Disney\\, you need to fix this. This movie has not pleased a lot of us long time fans. Visually it was stunning and the fights were amazing. Aside from all my other complaints. You did not so well with this one. Mark Hamill was the best performance of this entire movie.","true":true}
