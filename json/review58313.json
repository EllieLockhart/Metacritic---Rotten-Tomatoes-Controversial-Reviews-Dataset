Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abysmal. This movie is what happens if you have a director that hates all the elements that made Star Wars great (campy heroism\\, good storytelling\\, and consistent set of themes to name a few). \\n\\nThis is like an 2.5 hour commercial for PETA to the point where I have to know if they actually paid the director. \\n\\nAlso really glad they brought in a nihilist codebreaker into the same movie that looks like it was designed to sell stuffed animals to kids to talk about the nuances of arms dealing. \\n\\nThank you for ruining Poe's character by the way. \\n\\nThis movie isn't just bad. It's Rian Johnson giving the middle finger to Lucas in not so subtle ways. Oh you were excited to figure out what the story is with the Jedi sacred texts? Fuck you lol let's have Yodi appear and light them all on fire and say they were boring. Like that's actually what he says. Oh you wanted to see how wise Luke has become and what plot he has cooked up and what he's been doing. Well the most powerful Jedi in the universe tried to kill his disciple for having bad thoughts and now fishes and drinks space cow milk. And oh you wanted to see how Snoke would be as a real villain (seeing how Rey has already beaten Kylo) ? Nope let's make him do a half baked return of the Jedi sidious impersonation and them become completely irrelevant.","true":true}
