Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Questionably the best Star Wars film yet. It's crazy how people think that this movie is as bad as episode one or 2. insane. People overreact for such little flaws. This movie included everything u would want in a star wars film. absolutely brilliant ","true":true}
