Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, along with the force awakens have completely ruined Star Wars for me. They took everything that was great about Star Wars and through it away with horrible writing\\, huge plot holes and terrible useless characters with no progression.","true":true}
