Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weak story and plot\\, nice explosions. I don't see the complaints about the force usage\\, but the movie back stabs the original with its story and physics royally. Its story could have been so much better with the ship chase by turning it more of hunt for the rebel ship as it tries to out smart the empire whilst being tracked rather than follow that car and keep your safety distance while having the dumbest but pretty conclusion. Rey leans 4  prodigy years in a week or so and Lukes backstory is not something that some one who turned a multiple decades old dark lord to light would do. I'm mostly hoping for a reboot.","true":true}
