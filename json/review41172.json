Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie has killed the whole beloved franchise. whats worse it it is plain to see with all these recent 5 star reviews that they have also corrupted the real audience scores further religating the real fans opinions to mean nothing while they try and prop up thier bottom line with more lies and bullshit. all of this is un acceptable...they ruin things and then lie to us all and turn on the people that always supported them\\,..when bands get invited to the rock and roll hall of fame...the number one thing they say is we could not have done this without our loyal fans...so i give a 1 star because they have taken the name and produce an infirior product that is truly not even close to what it was intended to be...i only wish this site actually counted all the half and no star reviews...star wars is dead..!!!","true":true}
