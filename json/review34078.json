Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly long movie that just jumps from scene to scene with no real purpose. Only movie I\u2019ve ever came out of wishing I hadn\u2019t spent the money on it. Just my opinion though. ","true":true}
