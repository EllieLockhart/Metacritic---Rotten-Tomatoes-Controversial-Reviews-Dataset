Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought Seven was bad just because it was a rehash.  This movie\\, with Luke's total destruction of his character\\, inability for superior's to tell subordinates a plan\\, power level creep to levels seen in anime\\, I just can't believe it.  Former fan of Star Wars\\, this movie make me embarrassed to have ever been a fan at all.","true":true}
