Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. It was very different than the other Star Wars films and didn\u2019t really have a The everybody is on board and everything works out tone of the other movies\\, but i enjoyed that and I truly felt the exhaustion of trying over and over again to get some traction and lastly I completely understood and believed in hope by the movies end. I could hav done without the Princess Leia Space Mary Poppins scene and Laura Dern.","true":true}
