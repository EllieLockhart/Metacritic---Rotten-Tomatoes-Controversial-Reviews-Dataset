Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I don't really understand why these troll types are gathering to collectively **** on this game.

Looked forward to the 2nd one big time.  I think it's funny how people are raring with zero but praise the gameplay\\, graphics\\, music\\, design but have an issue with a couple story choices.  That's classic trolling and I think most of the people probably didn't even play the game.\r\rThe story and characters are not for the feint of heart.  It is an emotional ride and I think really hits you in emotional ways I haven't felt in a game\\, even the first one.  There are no politics or anything like that pushed into the game\\, I am not sure what these SJWs and fragile people are saying that.  You knew she was a lesbian in the Left Behind DLC from the first game\\, and it doesn't add or detract from the game honestly\\, it's just how it is.\r\rThe level design and gameplay is top notch.  The story went in a different direction than the first one but it was on point\\, script was great\\, the decisions and how it all plays it out is really well done and even if you don't agree with the direction it went I just think it's great story-telling either way.\r\rIf you play it you will be entertained\\, and mad\\, and sad\\, and happy\\, and everything in between.  I don't know why these idiots all got together to **** on an amazing game and easily GOTY\\, but I guess that's what you get sometimes.\r\rDo yourself a favor and play this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
