Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the critics even watch the movie? They land on the ice planet with 15 people\\, 2 mins later they have hundreds in the trench. Kylo and Luke stare each other down for 15 mins. Leia never used force powers but floats herself back. Leia doesn't die but Luke does. Luke is a bigger bitch than Kylo. Most of the movie involves around Poe. The codebreaker plot was horrendous. Fin is still trying to run away for the 20th time. Phasma is a worthless character and went down quicker than Maul. Only positive was Kylo and Rae fight scene. So many plot holes. Who is Snoke and who are her parents?","true":true}
