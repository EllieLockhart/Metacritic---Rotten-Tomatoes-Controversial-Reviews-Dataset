Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing! I know there's a small\\, vocal group of fans that don't like this because of the choices that were made in the movie\\, but I personally really enjoyed all the decisions that were made\\, especially when it comes to fan favorite Luke Skywalker. The writing for this movie is absolutely superb\\, the amount of depth and symbolism in almost all of the scenes is absolutely revolutionary (in terms of a star wars flick). There's one scene that seems a little superflous\\, but I still enjoyed it. I think Rian Johnson has set up a film that I inspires hope\\, and kind of \\\"cleans the slate\\\" allowing room for more than just legacy characters to be strong force users and main players in the galaxy.","true":true}
