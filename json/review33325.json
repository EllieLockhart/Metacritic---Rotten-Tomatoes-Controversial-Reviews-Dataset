Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surprised this is currently so low on audience score. I've been a big fan of the recent movies and really enjoyed this one as well. It was a bit of a crowd pleaser\\, and wasn't afraid to pull the rug out from under you- which kept you engaged. Wish it was slightly less action and a little more story\\, but it's a Star Wars movie so... can't complain","true":true}
