Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(No spoilers)\\n\\nIt may surprise some that Disney\\, the 2nd most influential and powerful media company in the world\\, has bought the majority of these positive reviews from \\\"professional critics\\\". Currently it's rated as 94% by RT \\\"critics\\\" \\n\\nIt's a disappointment\\, not as a film\\, as a representative of the medium.\\n\\nAll in all it's a mess. The writing is awful and doesn't fit the previous series\\, there are many things that don't make sense inside the movie. The directing was bad\\, the film contains many subplots which the viewer is not only indifferent to but resents. The producers should have put the money to better things. The actors want out. The best parts of the film in my opinion is Adam Driver. \\n\\nFor the amount of money that went into it the consumer should expect better.","true":true}
