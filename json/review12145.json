Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan. I never thought I'd see something with the Star Wars label and dislike it. Boy was I wrong! This film is an absolute travesty! Luke Skywalker's character was ruined\\, and killed in every way possible! Snoke's death was stupid and the OT characters are poorly represented while these new characters have zero story yet take over everything. Pile of garbage. That Holdo stuff was awful as well. Kyle Ren is a whiny baby villain. I didn't even like TFA\\, but I had hope for the future after watching it. I'm never spending money on Rise of Skywalker\\, it will likely be bad\\, and there's no way the franchise can get me to forgive this dumpster fire of a movie. Thanks Disney and Rian Johnson!","true":true}
