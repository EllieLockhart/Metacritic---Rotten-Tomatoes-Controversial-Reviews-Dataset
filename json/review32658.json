Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is not a good movie.\\n\\nMaybe as a standalone this movie could work\\, but as the second installment of a trilogy it fails miserably.\\n\\nWithin the first seconds (with the scrolldown text) the continuity with the previous movie is broken. Most of the intrigue from the previous movie isn't expanded upon. Characters from the previous movie have very little to no development\\, and badly fleshed out characters are added left right and center. The villains are made to comedic and inept for us to feel any real antipathy towards them. And the plot feels very confusing\\, and seems to depend heavily on plot armour\\, and mcguffins.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury (because i paid 9 hard earned euros for this movie). This very long movie lacks many explanations\\, but doesn't shy in giving us plenty of scenes of blatant product placement\\, and explicit US-specific political moralising.\\n\\nThis movie felt like an incoherent poorly writen cash grab\\, and the fact that the directors make this story as they go shows (in a very bad way)\\n\\nOn a lighter note Mark Hamill and Adam Driver give us great performances.","true":true}
