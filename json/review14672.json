Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been more disappointed in a film in my life.  I avoided all pre-film hype\\, had no preconceptions or theories I wanted to see on screen\\, but was just devastated by how bad this film was.  I wanted it to end about an hour before it actually did\\, it makes absolutely no sense\\, and feels like a massive practical joke.  I almost hope they could redo this film completely from scratch as the genuine second film of the trilogy and just wipe this one from history.  What a waste of Mark Hamill\\, feel so sorry for him that his final chance of playing Luke was this depressing mess.  \\nThis appears to be making a lot of money\\, will be interested to see whether the next week's box office sees a massive drop.  Please don't encourage them to make more poor films in this vein.  I don't know how they can follow this film and engender any sense of expectation - my desire to see Episode IX is non-existent.  \\nRian Johnson has created a terrible movie.","true":true}
