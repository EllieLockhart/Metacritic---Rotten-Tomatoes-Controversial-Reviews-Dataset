Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn\u2019t have been any more excited for this movie. Sadly\\, I felt let down by large portions of it\\, especially the beginning half. Snoke was swept under the rug with absolutely no backstory\\, and Finn\u2019s entire side story had no baring on the plot. For a character capable enough to create and organize the first order\\, he was instantly killed without explaining why someone of his importance was missing through episodes 1-6. Furthermore\\, the entirety of the plot would have been the same if Finn did not go on his mission. While I really wanted to enjoy this film\\, I often felt it was poorly cut\\, and just didn\u2019t flow well. I sincerely hope Episode 9 will enjoy a return to form. ","true":true}
