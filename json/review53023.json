Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie this movie did a great job to shock the audience and provide a different feel to the past movies. But as a star wars sequel preexisting lore is thrown out the window. Character progressions are everywhere such as Luke\\, the new republic\\, Phasma. Overall I can't give this a good review because it fails to be a sequel yet succeed to be a film","true":true}
