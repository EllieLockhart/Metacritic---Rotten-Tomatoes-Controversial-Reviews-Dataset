Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is one of the best star wars movies\\, however it is in no way the best star wars movie. Now some people don't like the movie because of some scenes that are in the film and now thats fine not everything works in the movie however there are still some many good scenes that really work. Some story elements are amazing for example Snokes death is one of the best points because it puts Kylo Ren in command of the First order\\, I feel like this because I really don't think that you need a Palpatine type character in every trilogy. Now I'm not gonna spoil any more of the movie. Now there is something that the people must remember and that is you cannot instantly judge this movie immediately after you come out of the theater. 9.5 star destroyers out of 10","true":true}
