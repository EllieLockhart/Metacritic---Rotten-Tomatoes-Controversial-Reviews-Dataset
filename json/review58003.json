Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2~t hate this movie\\, I have a few issues with it:\\n\\nForced humor:\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, forced humor has been an issue with all Disney star wars movies so far. Once again here this mistake was made. There were jokes which were geniuinly funny\\, but many which were unnecessary and not needed. Real shame.\\n\\nRey is too overpowered:\\n\\nAnother problem I have with this movie is that rey is far too powerful. Already in the force awakens\\, she managed to perform a jedi mind trick\\, (something which many more experienced Jedi like Qui-Gon Jinn didn't manage to pull off) and let the force guide Luke's Lightsaber to her. At no point in the movie is she even swiftly trained in the Jedi arts\\, and yet she managed to beat Kylo Ren\\, a man who has been trained from a young age in both the light and the dark side in a lightsaber battle? Are you frickin' kidding me? Also she seems to have become a jedi knight after a couple of days of training with Luke\\, becoming something others train years for.\\n\\nPlot holes for TFA not filled in TLJ:\\nDoes Rian Johnson hate JJ Abrams? Because I don't think he could've given JJ Abrams a harder Job in creating SW 9 than he did. JJ Abrams left many gaps at the end of SW 7\\, which was to be expected\\, and Rian Johnson really left a \\nlot of them open. I just hope JJ manages to work his way through it\\, and give us a stunning movie regardless.\\n\\nOverall we saw Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) deliver one   of the performances of his life in The last Jedi. We saw great performances by Daisy Ridley (Rey) as well as John Boyega (Finn) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren).\\nI found the Kylo and Rey's story very cool and interesting\\, and I hope we get to see more in the future.\\n\\n\\nI think 2.5\/5 is a fair rating for this film. It's not as good As the force awakens by a long shot.\\n\\nCan't wait to see what Star Wars 9 has in the locker for us!","true":true}
