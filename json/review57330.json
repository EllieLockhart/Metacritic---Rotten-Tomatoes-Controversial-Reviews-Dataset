Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not only a complete travesty of a SW film but also a total train wreck of a cinematic experience.    It would take pages to detail how idiotic this movie is\\, so I'll sum it up as: If you're a SW fan\\, you'll hate it for its laziness and continued disdain for the original characters.  If not\\, you'll find the lack of character development\\, pacing and plot extremely disappointing.  \\nWith Disney's resources and Lucasfilm's talent\\, this (like Ep. 7) could have been a solid extension to the greatest lore in movie history.  Instead\\, we have a vapid candy coated shell that only serves to pad Bob Igor's retirement and KK's evident need to destroy what GL so lovingly built.  What a damned crying shame.\\nAnd for those who defend Disney's SW by pointing to its lucrative nature - I would nod to the movie and counter that the weapons of war\\, opium and cigarettes have also made a ton of loot. Who cares.  This was something special that SW has destroyed with its incompetence\\, apathy and lust for money.","true":true}
