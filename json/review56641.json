Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE LAST JEDI REVIEW\\n\\nFew times does a movie not only meet my expectations but surpass them so far that no one even remembers what my previous positive expectations even looked like!!\\n\\nIt was everything I could have dreamed with the interactions between Rey and Kylo Ren.\\n\\nPoe had some character development I never expected\\, I loved the direction they took with him\\, he was so awesome and so passionate!!!\\n\\nFinn and Rose were super cute and funny. Finn learned a lot through his adventures with her and had a lot of great character development. \\n\\nI absolutely loved Leia's arc and her flying scene. I wanted to cry.\\n\\nLuke was awesome. I was ready to be disappointed by how they were handling his super whiney big Skywalker boy-ness\\, but in the end I wasn't. It made so much sense for him. And he made up for everything in the end by being himself\\, and being amazing.\\n\\nRey was super amazing and I love her!!!!!\\n\\nKylo Ren became more powerful and imposing and scary\\, and I always wanted to see that.\\n\\nThe battle scenes and story had a lot of unique elements I have never seen before. It was exciting\\, I was on the edge of my seat!\\n\\nThere was so much childish humour\\, I loved how it didn't take itself too seriously. I laughed a lot.\\n\\nWhat an EXCELLENT MOVIE!!! Go see it if you honestly just want some quality entertainment!!!!","true":true}
