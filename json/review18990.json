Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's definitely not the impactful crowd-pleaser that it's predecessor - \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" - was\\, but Rian Johnson's \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is definitely a memorable effort\\, if anything. Offering up challenging developments at every turn that mostly develop the decades-long franchise in a creative and fresh direction. And\\, though some of the decisions may be a bit more difficult to swallow than others\\, the sentiment to mix things up after 40 years of lore is definitely admirable. It also helps that the set pieces and lightsaber battles are all on point\\, and the fact that the characters and performances are all in line is also a plus. It's just the audacity and difference of it all that's gonna' a take while for me to get used to.","true":true}
