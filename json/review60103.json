Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Fantastic game\\, and a testament to great story telling. All the low reviews focus on what happens in the first hour of gameplay. If you wanted a happy story\\, go play uncharted. If you want something real\\, then buckle the f@$& up\\, because it won't hit any harder than this. The last of us is an emotional bulldozer of a series.

The last of us is an emotional bulldozer of a series. If you missed that from part one I'm sorry for your loss. This game is devastating and yet beautiful. The gameplay is immersive and fantastic. The controls are fluid and smooth. The scenery is vast and jaw dropping. The voice acting is out of this world. The story is alluring\\, it grabs you and never lets go. The last of us part 2 is a gripping tale of tragedy\\, loss\\, and the survival of both physical and emotional trauma. If you can't handle that suspense\\, don't play. It's simple. If you're looking for a game that will make you question your every action\\, sit back and question the very thin line of morality\\, then this is very much up your alley. If your attachments to characters from the first game keep you from enjoying the last of us part 2\\, please realize there problem isn't the game\\, it's you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
