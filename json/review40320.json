Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. Even if you ignore the 7 (count them) unnecessary characters in the film the plot and storyline can't hide the lack of effort involved on all counts. Instead of creating a solid story In which one could add some suspense or false leads\\, we are left with a film that lies to the viewer at every opportunity to synthesize suspense and ingenuity\\, I am a lifetime SW fan and I can honestly say I have no intention of paying to see another film in this saga. It is a joke\\, and I'm not going to take it seriously if they won't.","true":true}
