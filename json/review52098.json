Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing The Last Jedi\\, I was disappointed in how the narrative and characters were displayed. The movie had a lack of character development\\, a slow\\, rushed plot and the use of comedy in this movie was poorly timed and very awkward. What made me give this movie such a poor rating were the issues behind the studio itself. The director was trying to inject real life political agendas into this movie for the sake of making it more appealing to its target audience. I try to bring myself to liking this movie\\, but i just can't .\\n\\nI was truly disappointed in how Lukes character came out\\, and the lack of development between Rey\\, Snoke\\, Kylo and Rose. The movie really didnt subvert expectations\\, but rather just retconned a lot of moments.","true":true}
