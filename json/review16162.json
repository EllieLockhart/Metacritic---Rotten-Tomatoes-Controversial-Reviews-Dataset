Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving this 1 Star to be fair because me and  3 other people in my group decided to leave the theatre after the first part of the movie otherwise I would have given it  1\/2 a star. I have to say that I'm a fan of the original trilogy but except another friend in my group the other two didn't care about Star Wars very much so they were in just to enjoy a movie together (We are all about 30 years old).  I didn't have great expectation\\, I' am not a fan of episode VII\\, I find it inconsistent and not original but overall I think it's an ok movie\\, so I tried to have an open mind for this one. I did know about the mixed reviews but nothing could have prepared me for what I've witnessed.  I'm not going to debate the lore or the direction the story is progressing in these new films\\, I personally don't like it because for me Star Wars was something else and I think Disney could have told a new original story for the new generations without the need to destroy  the heroes of the old movies and their accomplishments\\, but \\, I repeat\\, this is only my personal  opinion.  Back to The Last Jedi I think that visually the movie is very good but storywise it was ridiculous\\, rushed\\, full of plot holes and inconsistecies and I'm not saying that in refer to the original trilogy\\, but to episode VII and even with itself. The characters choices and many scenes are totally random and don't make any sense. As if this couldn't be enough the movie is full of cheap forced \\\"funny\\\" moments and undeniable political topics that don't belong in a Star Wars movie at all. We had I think 6 or 7 kids sitting in the row in front of us but I never heard anyone laughing once. I'm completely puzzled about the great reviews this movie is getting. Is good visuals\\, special effects and cute birds really enough to make a bad movie a great movie?","true":true}
