Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a break from the tone and mythology of the original movies as well as The Force Awakens\\, that I was originally caught off guard. It was also easily the most nail-biting movie of the franchise. Every time you think Johnson is about to take a left\\, he hits you with a sharp right. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I think because of its suspense\\, as well as new elements that we have not yet seen in Star Wars films\\, it is easy to miss a lot of the small subtle details that makes the series wonderful. Upon my second viewing\\, I was able to see the wonder that is this film. It is a new direction\\, but this is something that must happen for the franchise to continue forward. One of the biggest critiques I kept hearing about The Force Awakens was that it was too much of a mirror to A New Hope. Johnson veers off to create something new\\, which is ultimately something great. ","true":true}
