Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The weakest of the Star wars films\\, I really have a sour taste in my mouth over the way this film was handled just being a bore fest and just trying to copy Empore Strikes Back.","true":true}
