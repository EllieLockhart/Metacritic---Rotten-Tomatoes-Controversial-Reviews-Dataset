Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was doing a marathon of all the Star Wars movies\\, and to not be sad\\, I stopped at the Return of The Jedi. This is the absolute worst Star Wars movie\\, and I know I'm not the only one whao thinks that way. Please\\, save yourself some time and don't watch this. Disney is trying to kill everything that we love.","true":true}
