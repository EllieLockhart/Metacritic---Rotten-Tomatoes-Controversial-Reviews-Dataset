Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was expecting this movie to be great but I was greatly disappointed for the following reasons:\\n\\n1. Bad uses of the force- Leia someone who never wielded a lighsaber could survive space? Rey being able to beat Luke within days\/weeks of training?\\n\\n2. Snokes death- supposedly he could trick and interpersonally connect ppl together but couldn't see (with the same minds he controlled) that Kylo Ren would kill him?\\n\\n3. Rehashed Plot--last battle was a bad version of the battle of hoth.\\n\\n4. Half the movie was a slow space chase...really? Why wouldn't the first order not catch one lone ship that couldn't hyperspace?\\n\\n5. RICH PPL ARE evil\\, SPACE PETA\\, 3rd wave feminism (Confirmed by the writers who on twitter and kathleen kennedy who explicitly said this was the purpose)\\, more could go on but this was the worst star wars movie I have ever seen.\\n\\nI will still be eager to see 9 and other Star Wars flicks from Disney maybe but this seriously killed my faith in Disney star wars.\\n\\nI.E This is coming from someone who loved Leia as a character. Someone who could fight\\, killed jabba the hut with her bare hands after being captured\\, and faced the greatest evil in the universe alone. she is a true\\, natural hero. The ones portrayed in this movie are forced and push an agenda","true":true}
