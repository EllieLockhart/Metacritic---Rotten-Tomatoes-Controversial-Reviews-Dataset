Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My only conclusion is that Rian Johnson has neither seen nor holds affection for Star Wars. In the same way that JJ Abrams decided he knew Star Trek better than anyone else\\, Johnson has decided that Star Wars needs less well rounded characters and more plot points masquerading as characters. Worse than Into Darkness\\, if a lot prettier. Hopefully Episode 9 will be better\\, but I have little hope. This movie did not ignite a spark.","true":true}
