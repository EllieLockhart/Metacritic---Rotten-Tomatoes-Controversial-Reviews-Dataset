Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely horrible writing with no real substance to it. At times I couldn't tell if I was watching a Star Wars movie or a combined rendition of The Hunger Games and Chronicles of Narnia. This is an absolute tragedy to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
