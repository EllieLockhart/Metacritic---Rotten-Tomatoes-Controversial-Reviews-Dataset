Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really distinct and exciting. Manages to be original but also feel like a proper Star Wars film. Easily one of the best. The characters are portrayed excellently and the dialogue is great. The pacing of some of the plot lines could have been tighter as they occasionally lulled. The film understands fans expectations and toys with them and subverts a lot of what was expected. Some may dislike this but I think it was done amazingly and to change would have made the movie too repetitive of previous films.\\n\\nIf you wanted a distinct Star Wars film then this should definitely fill that for you.","true":true}
