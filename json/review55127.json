Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

Imagine Lord of the Rings diminshing the fellowship characters to dribbiling weaklings by removing their strength of manly character. This movie abandoned the story.\\nLuke Skywalker was a grouchy old recluse who appeared weak the entire movie\\, Leia was ok\\, but stern and without emotion and pointless\\, and Laura Dern wore a high shcool prom dress while she battled the First Order to her death.\\nI could go on\\, but my experience of this movie was: trying to stay awake watching a 2 1\/2 hour video game.
