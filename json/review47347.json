Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of what could have been.  They could have made a reasonable cohesive plot.  Most disjointed poorly written film I have ever seen.  I actually never once felt like I was in a star-wars film.  Even the score was off.  Total lack of substance.","true":true}
