Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was great.  There was a lot of fun in the movie.  It definitely destroys expectations.  Some people aren't comfortable with that.  That says more about them then the actual movie.  The story has a lot of character development and makes kylo and ray way more interesting at the end of the film.","true":true}
