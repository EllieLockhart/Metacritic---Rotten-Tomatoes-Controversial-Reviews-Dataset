{"101487":170323,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-04","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi Review\\n\tI have made this statement before and I stand by it. The Last Jedi is a poorly written\\, self-insert fanfiction. That is not to say that it was all bad. The actors\\, in my opinion\\, did the best they could with a terrible plot line and awkward dialogue. The CGI was breath taking\\, and had me stunned to my chair saying\\, \\\"Holy crap this is awesome.\\\" Besides that\\, though\\, this movie was incredibly disappointing. Had it not been a Star Wars film\\, TLJ would be an average\\, run of the mill sci-fi epic\\, with a focus on making it look cool rather than making something interesting.\\n\tSo\\, I will start with my criticisms. First\\, whoever wrote this movie needs to be removed from working on another Star Wars film\\, ASAP. This movie felt as if the writer had never bothered to watch a Star Wars film and just read the blurb of the movie on Rotten Tomatoes. The lore was violated in many places\\, including the silly Leia space scene. The writers never bothered to use or involve many of the old side characters from the old films. Admiral Akbar was killed off without nearly a mention and without adding anything to the plot. \\nMy second criticism\\, plot holes galore. Many of the questions from the first movie remained woefully unexplained. What is this new \\\"Resistance\\\"? How did they come to be? How did the First Order come to be? What happened to the galaxy after the fall of Darth Sidious? Who the hell is Snoke? Why is he so powerful? Last I checked\\, the Emperor and Darth Vader spent an enormous amount of their time hunting down and destroying force users. Not to mention the Rule of Two. So\\, some incredibly powerful being that rivals the power of Darth Sidious came out of nowhere with barely an explanation. Again\\, the writers of this plot need a little dose of Force Lightning. The fact that so many plot holes remain and have yet to be explained is a classic flaw of a badly written film. \\nThese glaring plot holes aside\\, TLJ seemed intent on killing off every connection to the original trilogy they could get their hands on. By the time the credits rolled\\, only one character from the original trilogy remained\\, Leia. Carrie Fishers death was a serious blow to all Star Wars fans\\, so now even Leia is gone\\, taken from this world too early.\\nThird criticism\\, Rey. Daisy Ridley is fantastic in this movie. Her acting is on point and I have no issues there. In fact\\, Rey was one of the most engaging characters in this film. However\\, that does not save her character from being a clear Mary Sue that is akin to a self-insert character from shoddy fanfictions. Rey is\\, by and far\\, the most talented and gifted force user in the Star Wars trilogy\\, possibly in all of Star Wars. She can use force powers that is would take masters years to obtain\\, acquire lightsaber skills that match Kylo Ren's\\, despite the fact he has been using a lightsaber for much\\, much longer than Rey and she is able to defeat the most elite of Snoke's guard. Her abilities in this movie far outpace even Anakin Skywalker\\, who was the Chosen One and had force potential equal to Yoda. Luke Skywalker faced many adversities in the originals. He suffered a horrible defeat at the hands of Vader. Rey has had no such defeat and it seems that everything always seems to go her way. She never fails. Not in a real and moving way. She suffers minor setbacks but always seem to come out of they as quickly as they happened. All of this combined has the trademark scent of a Mary Sue. I defended Rey in the first film when she was accused of this\\, but now I can no longer disagree.\\nThe entire Finn and Rose storyline needed to be cut. Nothing of value came of it. Literally. They contributed zero the overall plot. They go out on this wild quest\\, land on possibly the most scathing representation of capitalism ever\\, just to end up finding a seemingly useful man and releasing some animals. That's it. The man they trusted soon betrays them\\, making him also irrelevant and they fail in the mission they set out to accomplish in the first place. They are bailed out when Home One smashed into Snoke's flagship. To make matters worse\\, I found the dialogue to be awkward and silly and the pseudo-romance between Rose and Finn seemed forced and empty. John Boyega is a superb actor\\, but even he could not save the plot line. Kelly Marie Tran had the great misfortune of playing Rose. Rose is\\, in no uncertain terms\\, the worse character in this movie. From the first scene to her last she contributed nothing. Less than nothing if that's possible. I found Rose to be annoying\\, self-righteous\\, and awkward. First\\, she interrupts Finn from going on a vital mission\\, joins him\\, and ends up adding nothing of value from there. Cut her and the movie would have not been affected in any way\\, save making it a little more entertaining. \\nPoe is one of my favorite characters in the movie\\, along with Finn and Leia. He is the Luke Skywalker from the originals\\, a full-fledged hero not afraid of danger and who seems invested in saving the life of his comrades\\, even though he is not always successful. He is not afraid to take danger head on or put himself in harm's way to protect others. A solid character. \\nNow we come to Luke Skywalker. Ah\\, how the mighty have fallen. It was obvious that TLJ was trying to make Luke the Obi-wan of this new trilogy. However\\, Mark Hamill is\\, sadly\\, no Alec McGinnis. Don't mistake me\\, Mark is an awesome actor and a staple of my childhood. However\\, his acting style is not suited to the calm collected mentor that Alec\\, and by some extent Ewan\\, portrayed. He feels like an old crazy hermit\\, indifferent to the world around him and a little unstable. His refusal to train Rey took up far too much screen time and felt repetitive and boring and left me there thinking \\\"Do something! Let's get this plot rolling!\\\" Although the motive was passible\\, it just didn't feel right. Yoda trained Luke\\, despite watching the entire Jedi order fall. Luke messes up once and he's like \\\"Nope. That's it. I'm done. Let the First Order rule the galaxy and let Ben Solo go around killing people. I'll just sit here and mope. Good luck everyone else.\\\" It only takes the spirit of Yoda showing up\\, which was downright silly and pointless\\, to convince him to change his ways. Even years after his death\\, Yoda seems to be the only person who can dispense any wisdom to people. Not to mention it's the biggest Dues ex Machina in this film. So\\, finally\\, we see Luke offer some sort of guidance to Rey. One teaching\\, that's it\\, yet somehow\\, that's all she needs. No running in the forest and failing to raise an X-wing. Just one teaching and she is set to go.\\nThe rise of Kyle Ren also is a complete 180 from the Luke Skywalker we know and love. This is the guy who refused to kill Darth Vader\\, who refused to fall to the Dark Side and now he is out here trying to kill the child of his friend and his sister? It seems they decided to bring a little more Joker into Mark Hamill than Luke. In his last scene\\, there was no tension. Everyone who knew anything about Star Wars knew exactly what would happen. This was Luke's Obi-wan moment where he sacrificed himself so that his allies might escape to fight another day. But the way they went about it was awful. Luke\\, using a power never scene in a Jedi before\\, transports himself to a different world\\, makes himself untouchable\\, yet his lightsaber still works. What? Although it was awesome to see Luke stepping out the barrage unharmed\\, that epic scene was tossed aside when you realize he is just an astral projection and not Luke in person. Luke's death\/transcendence to the Force was also unsatisfying. The hero of the original trilogy\\, the Chosen One\\, disappears a sweaty mess on some god-forsaken planet? This might have started out as his Obi-wan moment\\, but it quickly lost its appeal. \\nSo\\, what are we left with? It was obvious after watching the movie that Rian Johnson and Disney were banking on nostalgia and Michal Bay levels of CGI to carry them through the movie. While these two elements did make me smile and say\\, \\\"Oh my God\\, YES!\\\"\\, the rest of the movie was a hallow disappointment. A meandering and at sometimes boring storyline with no clear direction\\, an awkward chunk of dialogue\\, the downright horrible portrayal of amazing characters and atrocious use of Dues ex Machina had me leaving the theatre more disappointed in a movie than I have been in a long while. I only hope that the next movie is better than this one or the new Star Wars trilogy might be a dud\\, a case study on how not to do a movie. Disney\\, you delivered some of my favorite movies with your Marvel work\\, please don't let me down now.","true":true}
