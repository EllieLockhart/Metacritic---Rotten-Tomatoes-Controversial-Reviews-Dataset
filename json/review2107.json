Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the war between General Leia's (Carrie Fisher) Resistance and Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) First Order esculates to new heights\\, Rey (Daisy Ridley) must now attempt to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the last Jedi Knight\\, to leave his self-imposed exile behind and rejoin the battle against evil...\\n\\nFor the last two years\\, starting with the release of 2015's The Force Awakens\\, the combined efforts of Lucasfilm and Disney have managed to bring George Lucas's galaxy far far away\\, towards exciting new directions and opportunities with that film in spite of J.J. Abrams's tendency to reuse elements from the original trilogy throughout that film. The second film in the sequel trilogy\\, The Last Jedi\\, thankfully ditches this approach to storytelling in it's writing\\, although not in the way that one would expect based on what the  marketing campaign  suggests.\\n\\nDespite the presence of the infamous bird-like alien \\\"Porgs\\\" and having funnier banter than usual in a Star Wars film\\, it doesn't change the fact that The Last Jedi is possibly the most brutal and bleak film in the franchise since Revenge of the Sith. Rian Johnson isn't afraid of depicting the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order as a much more desperate and brutal conflict as shown in scenes in which quite a few known characters get axed off in seconds and the consequences of war\\, as shown in the sub-plot of Poe Dameron's (Oscar Issac) conflict with Leia's trusted Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern)\\, gets much greater focus than before. A far-cry from the serial-inspired battles of the original films\\, to be sure.\\n\\nMark Hamill\\, after only getting a small cameo in the last film\\, steals the show as a grumpier\\, embittered Luke while the recently departed Carrie Fisher gives an excellent final performance as Leia\\, although given the circumstances of her death\\, some of her scenes can be quite upsetting to watch. Although both John Boyega and newcomer Kelly Marie Tran have excellent chemistry between each other and the previously mentioned Oscar Issac finally gets to flesh out his character a lot more\\, both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren don't seem to be as committed as last time though as a lot of thier scenes drag on for ages.\\n\\nOverall\\, despite having some incredibly odd moments and some unsatisfactory pay-offs\\, The Last Jedi is a wonderful film to celebrate not only the 40th birthday of the film that launched the Modern Age of cinema\\, but also to remember why we loved these films in the first place. With the tragic passing of Carrie\\, Kenny Baker and numourous other figures in the franchise over the last two years\\, the most important thing to remember is that\\, to quote Master Yoda himself\\, it's important to \\\"pass on\\, all that you've learned\\\" and keep moving forward without relying too much on the past and judging by the overall message of this film\\, it couldn't be more true than ever.","true":true}
