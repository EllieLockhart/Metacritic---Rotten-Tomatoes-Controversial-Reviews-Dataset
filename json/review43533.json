Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was essentially a Marvel movie. The writer\/director ignored 43 years of established canon and mythology. In doing so\\, he and Disney have hijacked the most iconic ongoing film story ever.  This was a corny popcorn movie chock full of engineered laughs\\, unnecessary characters (Rose\\, why?)\\, continuity problems\\, and deviations.  It seems that Disney was much more concerned with toy sales than they were with being good stewards of our greatest example of modern mythology. Not to mention\\, the complete butchering of the Luke Skywalker character. F-ing astral projection battles\\, disappearing suicide?? What was I looking at??\\n I'm sure they'll sell a lot of those bird things that had no bearing on the plot whatsoever this Christmas though. Rian Johnson and Disney\\, how dare you?","true":true}
