Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely amazing\\, i know it's far from perfect this movie did not deserve the hate it got from part of the fanbase.\\nVisually stunning\\,with great plot twists and amazing action this movie is the only one that comes close to the greatness of the original trilogy.","true":true}
