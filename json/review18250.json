Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the film hit terrific high notes\\, managed the tension and juggled a huge cast well.  There were several scenes with some of the most beautiful shots in the series.   Adam Driver gives a powerful and riveting performance.  It has humor\\, action and tension running throughout\\, and the audience laughed\\, cried and cheered at several moments.","true":true}
