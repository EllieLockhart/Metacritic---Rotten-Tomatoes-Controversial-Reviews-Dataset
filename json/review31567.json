Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much has been said already. All I'll say is this was simply poor story telling. Okay\\, no\\, I'll say a little bit more. The humor was painfully out of place. The villains constantly came across as schmucks. No one in their right mind would be afraid of this New Order. And there was absolutely no reason\\, none at all\\, for that ultimately useless side quest to the casino.","true":true}
