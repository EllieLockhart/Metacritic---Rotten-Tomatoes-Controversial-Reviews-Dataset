Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was purely made for Disney's bottom line. The story was incoherent and boring... at 2.5 hrs long it was overkill. Kathleen Kennedy has ruined what was once a great saga. Although\\, I will refrain from blaming everything on her as Lucas certainly didn't help with revising the originals in the 90's along with creating the prequels. But leaving that aside... \\n\\nI'm not a fan boy but I loved the originals from when I was younger. The characters were relatable and the audience sympathized and shared a purpose with them while actively following along the journey. It was a classic adventure story with a simple plot\\, character arcs\\, diverse characters\\, excellent acting\\, and even better editing. It really didn't matter that it took place in space\\, the stories were so classic they could have been transported to almost any setting\\, which is why they were inherently well written\\, edited\\, and produced.\\n\\nNothing of that sort is included in this film. The characters are forgettable\\, no real purpose\\, the plot is awful and has too many holes\\, hints of SJW themes\\, and its too long. It felt like it was written by a child\\, or perhaps it was written for babies. It's just amateur hour really. Sure the visuals are amazing and that's really the only thing that kept my eyes on the screen\\, but everything else fell short.... way short.\\n\\nI left the theater with zero emotion. I didn't care about any of the characters. Rey is a Mary Sue (she can do everything and nothing can go wrong)\\, Finn is just as worthless as in SW:TFA\\, Leia is cringeworthy at times... they should't have given Fisher such a prominent role\\, Chewy is non-existent\\, R2 is non-existent\\, even BB8 which I actually liked from TFA was put in the back seat for the most part. Poe was actually pretty good\\, his character was more richer than all the other ones. Kylo was decent\\, a small development in his character but nothing that made me care really. And lastly Luke was pretty damn good. Considering what Hamill had to work with\\, he did a pretty good job. He captured some of that boyish-Luke from what we remember except he's older now. I enjoyed him for the most part and wished he played a bigger and better role in the movie.\\n\\nMy recommendation: don't give anymore money to these fraud hack hollywood producers until they actually take films seriously and provide real entertainment with rich stories and fun character arcs.","true":true}
