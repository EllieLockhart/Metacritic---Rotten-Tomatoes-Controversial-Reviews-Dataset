{"101487":132664,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you liked season one of Star Wars rebels\\, I guess you'd like this movie as well\\, because that's what it felt like I was watching. This realization slapped me in the face while I was just trying to let myself enjoy watching it in the theater for the first time\\, and I was sad. Here are some parallels that brought it down to that level of quality\\, and some thoughts on why I felt it was not just a bad Star Wars movie\\, but not a very good movie at all. 1. Forced expositional dialogue (\u201cI have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself.\u201d) It\u2019s not only sloppy writing\\, but it shows a lack of confidence in the audience for these types of lines to not be revised by the time shooting began. It\u2019s treating the viewer like a child who won\u2019t notice how lazy the dialogue is. 2. Forced humor in all kinds of places where it didn\u2019t fit the character or tone. I won\u2019t list examples. They are everywhere. And yes\\, I laughed out loud at times\\, especially at first\\, and then it turned into nervous laughter\\, and then I kind of grimaced\\, and only laughed when my daughter started crying with adoration every time she saw a porg. 3. Flat characters that we knew and cared nothing about trying and failing to tug on our heartstrings. Not to mention super-forced social statements like the whole casino scene. The first order just killed billions of people with Starkiller base. So no\\, it is not polished storytelling to spend so much effort and time to try to get the audience's emotions invested in a few animals and how some gamblers were treating them. And I'm the target audience for that kind of compassion\u2014I\u2019m a compassionate vegetarian\\, and yet even I felt that it was an embarrassing sequence. It had no place in the movie. Again\\, this was insulting the intelligence of the audience. 4. Jedi powers just being invented\u2014specifically concerning the whole projecting my astral self across the galaxy ability. Yes\\, a cool ability\\, but it doesn't line up with the established universe\\, which matters. It just does matter in a franchise movie whether a director\/writer wants it to or not. You can't give this power to little-trained Luke Skywalker when the Jedi\\, at the pinnacle of their power with generations of teachings and reflection\\, meditation and collaboration to call upon\\, never figured this out. Darth Plagueis\\, who was so in-tune with the force that he could convince the midi... I can\u2019t bring myself to acknowledge them... that he could manipulate the force into creating life\\, couldn\u2019t project his being\\, or bridge minds together. But Luke\\, who hasn\u2019t been practicing\\, exploring\\, and meditating with the force all these years but rather closed himself off to it\\, could\\, out of the blue\\, pull that off. There are two problems with this power. The first is what I've just mentioned. The second is the misuse of Luke's character at the end to such a degree that it leaves original fans feeling purposefully abused. I'm not saying we WERE purposefully abused. Please think about that. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it leaves no other option but for us to feel like it. We can't help it. It feels like a slap in the face. It even feels that way to Mark Hamill\\, so it's hard to argue against the fact that this was a problem with characterization and storytelling. Luke did not come to his friends' rescue and demonstrate why the Emperor had feared his power. Instead he did this weird thing and... died? Why\\, exactly? There are probably 50 very good alternate endings available to read in all the corners of the internet. My son and I recently concocted one so good\\, we just had to stop talking about it because of how saddening the true ending was in comparison. 5. Earth-style dialogue. Yes\\, in the original Star Wars\\, our three main protagonists often had dialogue that grounded them as relatable humans. But the tone of the dialogue here was far outside of the established universe. It was like watching a World War II movie where characters kept calling things \u201cgroovy\\,\u201d or \u201cgnarly\\,\u201d or made peace signs at each other. That wouldn\u2019t be its own style--it would be out of place. It would be like a Star Trek movie that had the characters enjoying a Beastie Boys song. \ud83d\ude10 6. Universe-shattering plot devices. There is just no getting over this: If any faction could have at any moment pointed a spaceship at the enemy and jumped to hyperdrive to destroy a large enemy ship\\, not only would it have been done by now\\, it would have instantly been the first move made in every serious space battle since hyperdrive technology was invented in that galaxy which would have been\\, what--housings of years? Think of all the large ships Star Wars folk have struggled to blow up over the years. Think of the lives and resources lost. If this was a possibility\\, it would have been done. I\u2019ve considered every argument against this and there isn\u2019t a valid one. It\u2019s so bad. It\u2019s just so bad. 7. Yoda. He looked so odd. He didn\u2019t look as healthy as his force ghost in ROTJ\\, but rather looked like he did when he was bloated on his death bed. That aside\\, he didn\u2019t act like the real Yoda\\, but rather like the silly persona he assumed when he first met Luke in Empire. That was never actually Yoda\\, and yet here was Yoda acting like that again. Okay\\, bring back Yoda because you know that's going to make people happy. Ooooookay\\, make him a puppet for nostalgia... I guess\\, even though Episode III Yoda was phenomenal. But if you're going to do that\\, get the character right. They didn't. At the end of the day\\, having Ewan MacGregor as Obi-wan's force ghost would have made so much bigger of an impact. This is another missed opportunity that I have to force myself to stop thinking about because it just makes me so sad. So\\, as you can clearly see\\, I didn\u2019t like it. In fact\\, I consider it actual trash. But if you did like it\\, I\u2019m glad. I\u2019m sincerely happy that some people love it\\, and received happiness from watching it. I\u2019m just not one of those people. ","true":true}
