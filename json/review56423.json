Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best star wars movie yet!! I seriously loved every single second of it. It was so enjoyable\\, the comedic moments were nonstop\\, there was incredible character development\\, and the franchise TRULY delivered on some epic space battles. I really truly appreciated the pacing of the film. There was so much happening but not to the point to where it was distracting. It allowed your eyes to focus on one element at a time without feeling overwhelmed. I also LOVED the direction they\u2019re taking the story arc of \u201cthe force\\,\u201d making it feel less exclusive to a select few and instead\\, something available to everyone. I am so glad Disney didn\u2019t rehash the old 1 dimensional \u201crandom really powerful Jedi\\, random super evil Sith Lord\\, epic lightsaber battle at the end\u201d storyline. Instead they\u2019re reinventing it for a new generation while honoring past films!! I will also say that this movie in certain ways helps to redeem the often criticized prequel trilogy... in very subtle ways. I thought that was a nice touch. Truly\\, a perfectly done Star Wars film.","true":true}
