{"101487":105663,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from the visuals this was one of the worst moves I have ever seen\\, along with the force awakens. There is not a single logical plot point in relation to the physics of the star wars universe\\, and the acting\\, editing\\, directing\\, and writing are atrocious. Mark hamill gives a good performance but it is impossible to tolerate Disney annihilaing every philosophical aspect of Star Wars\\, which are the only redeeming aspects of any the original films in the first place. This movie is a cash grab and a set up for the use of the Star Wars brand to be weaponized for billions and to stage a propaganda campaign for the brainwashing of children\\, which has been Disney's obvious agenda since it's military branch did cartoons for the us military during the nuclear and Human cultural propaganda campaigns after ww2. Just watch Disney kids channels with sociological intuition. But I am not going to spend hours dissecting every plot hole\\, Star Wars universe absurdity\\, or betrayal of ancient jedi wisdom in this movie. You could write your doctorate in psychology deconstructing the subliminal garbage in this film\\, but I will state for the record that there is a conspiracy and collective group think involved in the good reviews and acclaim this movie is recieving. Compare this movie to the greatest films of all time or even to the revenant or lotr\\, this movie is nothing but ontologically terrible filmmaking. Think for yourself\\, remember the wisdom of master Yoda and obi-wan and stay true to your jedi or sith teachings. Fight this empire of Disney. They sell conservatives espn national anthems and big foot shows on the history channel and push sjw politics in Star Wars. They take both sides for your money\\, it's a con. Anyone who likes this movie for its feminist values is a fool\\, like Disney cares about fighting the phallocracy\\, they are the vehicle of sexism\\, they sexualize little girls and turn them into pop idols to brainwash your children. Then you give Disney fifteen dollars a family member and sit your five year olds in front of their mind control panels for two and a half hours. Have we lost our minds or what\\, the last jedi sucked and was really stupid but it has universal acclaim and half our population just repeats what the tv screen tells them like weak minded fanboys of old. So I meditated for a few hours in the candle lit caverns in the valley below my house and I realized that all we can do about this one is live the way a Jedi would and make sure to never let anyone get away with claiming this movie is good without a two hour lecture on the expanded universe\\, the geopolitical monopoly and history of the Disney corporation\\, indigenous science\\, systems science\\, permacultural anthropology\\, the hagakure\\, and the pataphysics of the simulacrum. Etc. if you don't know about those things yourself\\, read a book\\, but anyway I'll let the movie speak for itself and your education limit your ability to see through it.","true":true}
