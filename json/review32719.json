{"101487":170306,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\n\\nI love Star Wars. I grew up on it. I love a good story and I love a good adventure. As a boy I was captivated by the films. I would play with the lego\\, reenact battles with the figurines\\, and eventually play the hero in the Battlefront games. Star Wars is a part of my childhood. Today\\, I still have the lego\\, a fleet of battleships on my shelf\\, and a toy lightsaber (Which isn't a toy at all\\, but an elegant weapon of a more civilised age). Which\\, on occasion\\, when my wife isn't to be seen\\, I've turned off all the lights\\, ignited the lightsaber and attacked the furniture (I haven't lost a single battle yet).  For me\\, Star Wars is timeless. \\n\\nSo unfortunately\\, I am saddened to say that I was disappointed in the latest instalment of the Star Wars saga. I loved episode VII\\, which had left me with a feeling only Star Wars (and Harry Potter) can bring: a sense of wonder\\, intrigue and wanting more. However\\, episode VIII failed to deliver and felt awkwardly disjointed. Episode VIII has been receiving a lot of positive reviews\\, so people may be surprised to read what I just said. They may point out that The Last Jedi is witty\\, action-packed and has amazing cinematography. And they would be right. But is it Star Wars? Does it live up to good story-telling? A magician dazzles the crowd\\, uses sleight of hand to distract the masses from seeing what really took place. This is what I feel happened with episode VIII. After The Force Awakens I think it's safe to say we were left with some key questions: \\n\\nWhat has Luke Skywalker been doing this whole time? Why did he leave?\\nWho is Supreme-Leader Snoke?\\nWho is Rey's Parents? \\nHow did Ben Solo become to be Kylo Ren?\\n\\nAll these questions are either inadequately answered or disregarded in The Last Jedi. Sure\\, they tell of how Luke Skywalker has been hiding out on his own private island\\, brooding over the fact that in a moment of weakness he considered killing his nephew\\, Ben\\, whom he sensed was turning to the dark side. But is this truly in character for Luke Skywalker? Should we just forget that this is the man who turned Darth Vader\\, a villain infinitely more terrifying and far gone than a young Ben Solo\\, back to the good side? If after a few brief moments with Kylo\\, Rey was convinced he could be returned to the good side\\, than why not Luke? This is too much of an inconsistency to ignore. \\n\\nAs for Supreme-Leader Snoke\\, episode VII left us intrigued by the mystery that surrounds this new villain who somehow had resurrected a remnant of the Empire when it was on the brink of death. The Last Jedi furthered this intrigue by revealing Snoke's power\\, such as force lightening\\, a feat that only two other force-users in the Star Wars films have: Emperor Sidious and his apprentice\\, Darth Tyrannus. Despite this intriguing mystery\\, The Last Jedi decided to leave it unresolved with Snoke's convenient and untimely death. No more information on who Snoke was and how he came to power is given. his character is left completely unexplored. \\n\\nSpeaking of characters left completely unexplored\\, Rey's parents. There was so much potential left after episode VII on developing Rey's story. Who are her parents? Were they force users too? Were they good? Evil? In her flashback\\, why is Obi-Wan's voice heard calling her name? None of this is explored further\\, but we are given the lack-of-creativity answer of: Rey's parents are no one. Junk traders who sold her on Jakku. That is the biggest anticlimactic revelation in cinema history. Now\\, of course\\, there is always the possibility that this revelation given to Rey from Kylo Ren\\, is in fact a lie. And I sincerely hope that is the case. But if not\\, then this was some serious\\, lazy writing. \\n\\nContinuing the disaster of unexplored characters is how Ben Solo came to be Kylo Ren. The Last Jedi's overly simplified answer is that at one time Ben was training to become a Jedi with Luke as his master. Luke\\, however\\, increasingly became aware of a darkness within the young Ben Solo. One evening while Ben was sleeping Luke saw a glimpse of the potential dark horror that lies within Ben Solo. And for a moment\\, ignited his lightsaber with the intent of killing his young apprentice. He of course almost instantly regrets the thought\\, but it was too late. Ben Solo had awoken to see his uncle and master standing over him about to murder him. And so\\, he fights back. Destroys the Jedi temple. And becomes Kylo Ren. No new information is given\\, no explanation\\, on how he came to be Snoke's apprentice. \\n\\nAll these questions were apparently unimportant to writer and director Rian Johnson. And so it seems was the actual plot of the movie. \\n\\nAfter a death-defying space battle and escape\\, the Resistance is on the run from the First Order. Unfortunately for them\\, the First Order have some savvy new tech that allows them to track the Resistance through hyper-space. Running low on fuel\\, and unable to make a jump to hyper-space without being followed\\, the Resistance push their starship's engines to barely stay out of range of the First Order's fleet's cannons\\, while searching for a near-by planet they hope to land on unseen. With General Leia Organa unconscious from the space battle\\, Admiral Holdo orders the Resistance to pack into smaller transports and head to the near-by planet which has an abandoned Rebels base. The hope is that the First Order would continue to fire upon the main cruiser while the cloaked smaller transports make their desperate escape. Unfortunately\\, the First Order learn of this plan and open fire upon the fleeing Resistance\\, killing them off one by one until a Remnant make it to the planet's surface for the final showdown. \\n\\nThe problem with all this is\\, that all the complications of the Resistance was caused by their own Commander Poe Dameron. It was Poe in the initial space battle who defied General Leia's orders and engaged in battle with the First Order's fleet. It was Poe who became concerned of Admiral Holdo's lack of plan and led and mutiny against her. (Admiral Holdo had decided to keep her genius escape plan to herself\\, a move that doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't she share the escape plan with her crew?). It was Poe who then sent Finn and his new friend\\, Rose\\, on a secret wild goose chase to find a hacker who can stop the First Order's new tech from tracking them. This then led to Finn\\, Rose and their hacker being captured by the First Order before completing their mission and consequently causing the First Order to learn of the Resistance's plan\\, and  killing a lot of fleeing Resistance soldiers along with Admiral Holdo. Let's face it\\, Poe Dameron\\, the celebrated Resistance hero pilot of episode VII\\, in The Last Jedi\\, is an absolute military catastrophe. Take him out of the film and there would of been little to no complication. Further more\\, because of his epic failure of a mission\\, Finn has no real bearing on the plot. All of his scenes  of wandering around a casino planet looking for a hacker\\, were for nothing. And by the way\\, if they managed to get Finn and Rose safely undetected to a near-by casino planet\\, why hadn't Admiral Holdo's original plan occurred to Poe\\, Finn or Rose? Why had they not thought to just secretly send everyone off-ship undetected?  \\n\\nMeanwhile\\, Rey has abandoned her attempts at coaxing Luke back into the fight\\, along with her Jedi training (after only two lessons)\\, and is now aboard Snoke's ship in the hope of turning Kylo Ren to the good side. Things are looking positive for her quest\\, as Kylo slaughters the only intriguing villain\\, Supreme-Leader Snoke\\, frees Rey\\, and together kill Snoke's red armour clamoured bodyguards. At this point\\, I was shocked the writer had killed off the mysterious Snoke. But for a moment\\, I quickly became intrigued by the idea of Kylo returning with Rey to the Resistance. I pictured them teaming up to vanquish some unknown dark force user  who must of been lurking in the shadows\\, unbeknownst to us orchestrating Snoke's reign this whole time. But no. As quickly as Kylo turned on Snoke\\, he turns on Rey and the Resistance\\, fashioning himself as the new Supreme-Leader and going along with the entire movie's theme of inconsistency. \\n\\nWe are then left with a showdown between Kylo and his old master\\, Luke Skywalker (who randomly decided to show up). Except it isn't much of a shown down at all. In fact there isn't a single moment within The Last Jedi of an actual lightsaber on lightsaber duel. The two lightsaber yielding figures circle each other\\, speaking of their dysfunctional relationship. Finally\\, Kylo thrusts his lightsaber into Luke\\, yet it appears to go right through him. We then learn that Luke is still on his own private island. (He couldn't be bothered to actually get into the fight). Instead he was doing some sort of force projection of himself. And yet\\, he somehow still manages to die\\, fading off into the wind like Yoda or Obi-Wan. \\n\\nI have seen this movie herald as the greatest of all the Star Wars films. And I have to wonder\\, were people even paying attention? As a stand alone film I did enjoy it. It was funny and action packed. However\\, in the greater context of the saga\\, nothing happened. We are still in the same position as we were at the end of episode VII. It almost feels as though Rian Johnson decided to write this script as if it was the first movie of a new Star Wars trilogy. This film is flawed\\, riddled with inconsistencies and lost opportunities. The writing was senseless and lazy. My only hope is that JJ Abrams can salvage this trilogy as he steps back into the role of Director for episode IX.","true":true}
