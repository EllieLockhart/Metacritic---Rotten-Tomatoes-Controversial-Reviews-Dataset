Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the force is strong with Disney shills. Seriously if you just remove the Star Wars part and look at how the movie is actually structured it's absolutely trash. The pacing is terrible\\, the plot is weak\\, there are so many useless scenes\\, the list goes on. Now if you take into account the issues within the Star Wars universe itself it looks even worse. Give this movie 5 years and people will feel just like they feel about the prequels now\\, which is mostly hated.","true":true}
