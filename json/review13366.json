Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it.  Will see it again and again. There's just not anything wrong with it.  I've seen everyone in the theatre\\, this was the first one in 3D and it added to the fun.  Kept my attention\\, cared about the characters -- two years seems so far away.","true":true}
