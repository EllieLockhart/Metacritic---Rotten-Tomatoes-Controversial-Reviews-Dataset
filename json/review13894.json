Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you are a long time fan of the original trilogy\\, this movie will destroy everything you know and love. this movie and the force awakens are a pile of s**t. rogue one was really good. to bad that director didn't make the episodes too... don't waste your money","true":true}
