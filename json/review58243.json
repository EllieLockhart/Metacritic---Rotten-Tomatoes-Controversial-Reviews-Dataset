Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"50% part of me loved TLJ... 50% part of me hated TLJ.\\nI wanted to love that movie badly\\, unfortunately\\, there was so many plot holes\\, characters dead-ends and WTF nonsense moments that ultimately\\, TLJ fell flat for me. Honestly\\, its starts great\\, almost epic\\, then it has great moments of Awe then shifts into the weird\\, during middle part\\, then almost like scene filler\\, and after that\\, sadly goes downhill fast until the very end. For fans\\, not at all a true Star Wars\\, for new generation kids\\, maybe something they will enjoy.","true":true}
