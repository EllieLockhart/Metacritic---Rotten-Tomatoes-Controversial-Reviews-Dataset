Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Get rid of Kathleen Kennedy. This film is worse than anything they possibly could've done. And Luke Skywalker has never been more disrespected than with this corporate garbage.","true":true}
