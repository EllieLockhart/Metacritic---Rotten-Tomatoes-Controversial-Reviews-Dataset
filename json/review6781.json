Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to what the critics are trying to shove down your throat. The script was horrible. If this is the new direction Star Wars is headed\\, Disney might as well call this story line quits and create something completely new that has nothing to do with the original episodes. New viewers to the franchise will love this movie. Anyone with any kind of knowledge to the Star Wars universe will be very disappointed. Save your money and hurt their box office earnings. Nothing speaks louder than your wallet. I wish I would have done the same.","true":true}
