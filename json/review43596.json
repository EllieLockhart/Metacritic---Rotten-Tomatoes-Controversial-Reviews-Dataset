Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not even a Star Wars film\\, it was a Disney toy commercial for the Christmas season\\, and a lousy one at that. It did not even try to tell a cohesive story or build upon what came before\\, it simply bombarded the audience with flashing lights and explosions and marked off Social Justice check boxes for a couple hours. If you have an inkling of fondness for the Star Wars franchise\\, do not waste your time or money with this film.","true":true}
