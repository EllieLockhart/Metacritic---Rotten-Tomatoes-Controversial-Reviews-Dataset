Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good addition to the Star Wars universe. While there are some small scenes and moments that make you turn your head asking \\\"Really???\\,\\\" the movie does finally pave a new path for the current trilogy and provides some solid laughs and twists during the movie. \\n\\nDaisy Ridley is wonderful again\\, as is Oscar Isaac. Adam Driver does bring more depth to the Kylo Ren character\\, and really starts to break away from the Darth Vader rehash that Force Awakens made him seem to be. \\n\\nOverall\\, I think most Star Wars fans will enjoy this movie. A solid Sci-Fi movie overall.","true":true}
