Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. so much so I created an account here just to vent somewhere. I found myself smacking my lips at every attempt to make the film \\\"suspenseful\\\" it was so cheeesily done and as a viewer you cant help to say \\\"really?\\, thahts really whats happening??\\\" in a scene a whole ship is bombarded but\\, the two main characters are\\, alive...just because.... and princess leia \\\"dies\\\" but wait\\, shes flying back to the ship shes...shes..shes... alive \\, ofcourse she is! and later on is seen in the movie like nothing happened\\, no recoop time not limping shes like \\\"hey guys nevermind me floating in orbit\\, I'm alive nothing happened. you can definitely see Disney's involvement on this one\\,  all a clich\u00e9 woman rule men drool good guys cant die bs\\, star wars used to be such a great franchise.","true":true}
