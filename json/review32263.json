Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fan from day one.  I'm not their audience anymore.  All plot lines ignored or shoved aside from Star Wars lore\\, even departing from what The Force Awakens started.  Welcome to the new Transformers.  Disrespectful to any fan of original franchise.  That wasn't Luke\\, who is Snoke??  Rey is... No one?  Brilliant.  Oh and now those that are force sensitive can fly through space after being blown up and frozen. Moronic.  Zero men that you can look up to or invest in all massively flawed if not pure evil.  All women are perfect and beyond reproach.  Sign of the times?  Yes.  Needed in a Star Wars movie?  No.  I'm done.","true":true}
