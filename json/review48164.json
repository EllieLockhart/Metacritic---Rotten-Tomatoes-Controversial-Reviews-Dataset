Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this was an incredibly pretty movie\\, it ultimately failed because of cinematic plot holes. This has nothing to do with fan culture plot holes (of which there are many)\\, and I do not understand why the critic rating for this movie is so high when there are objective holes to this movie. You find out towards the end of the Last Jedi that the entirety of the story and its tragedies could have been prevented by a single sentence in communication between the leadership of the resistance and their crew. For the whole movie to be built upon something so fragile makes this movie fall apart. I kept thinking\\, \\\"wow\\, had this simple conversation happened\\, this entire movie could have been prevented\\\". There are many parts to this movie I was asking myself\\, \\\"Why is this in here? This doesn't belong here.\\\" Many parts did not contribute to the plot or develop any characters. In fact\\, there was more character development in\\, dare I say\\, the Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. Definitely\\, go see this movie\\, but shut your brain off so you can ignore the lack of effort put into this story.","true":true}
