Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kids (under 15) who don't know any better will like this for the first day or two post viewing\\, but it's so bad I don't know where to begin. Wait for video - or better yet - when it's on Netflix. Even then\\, only watch it in private and keep a barf bag near by.","true":true}
