Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to believe Disney paid $4 billion for Star Wars only to destroy it's most iconic character. But that's what they did in this movie.\\n\\nI agree with Mark Hamill. Even in the darkest of scenarios\\, it's impossible to believe that the Luke Skywalker of Star Wars VIII is the same character as the Luke Skywalker of Star Wars IV\\, V\\, and VI. In Star Wars VI\\, Luke Skywalker put his life on the line to redeem a father he never knew. But in VIII\\, we're supposed to believe that he would actually contemplate killing his sister's and Han Solo's son\\, and his own student. Then\\, in the final confrontation with Kylo Ren -- the new Supreme Leader -- Luke turns into some kind of Clint Eastwood tough guy. Really?\\n\\nIt's unbelievable\\, for one thing. And for another thing\\, it simply demolishes the principled\\, heroic Luke Skywalker of Star Wars IV\\, V\\, and VI. \\n\\nWhy would Disney do this? Is it possible that didn't understand what they were doing? \\n\\nI doubt it. I think it was their aim. This was a deliberate attempt to take down virtually everything difficult or heroic in the franchise. Luke Skywalker -- a killer. Po Dameron -- a yahoo. Finn -- still trying to run away\\, even after he goes all out to save Rey in the previous movie. Yoda -- reduced from badass Jedi master to laughing Buddha. \\n\\nEven the Force gets a major downgrade. We see Leia flying through space like some kind of Jedi ghost. And Rey lifting an entire landslide of boulders with no apparent effort. It's ridiculous. The movie trashes almost every difficult achievement.  \\n\\nApparently in the new Star Wars\\, there's nothing much to heroism\\, the Force\\, or the Jedi. So what's left? Beats me\\, and I won't be in a hurry to find out when Christmas 2019 rolls around.","true":true}
