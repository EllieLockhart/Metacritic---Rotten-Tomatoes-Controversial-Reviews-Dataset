Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, soundtrack was great. But the story was awful\\, characters were misrepresented and it is full of plot holes and inconsistencies.  After TFA I was excited for the next film. After TLJ I care so little I will waiy for episode 9 to come out on Netflix to watch it.","true":true}
