Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fast pacing can't gloss over th eman hating and complete disregard for the original thmse of the movie.  The senseless plot and gutting of cool previous characters makes thsi an antifa mentality goof fest.   Not even enough space dogfights.  No training needed to be a jedi when your a girl.  lol    female and democrat ego fanservice but poops on all the ideas of honor etc.   Major characters killed off.  White hating.  2 only for the semi fast pacing that makes u forget the idiocy and the brief teamup\\, which if kept coulda maybe saved the series.  parent hating so distasteful.","true":true}
