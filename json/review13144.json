Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know why people are saying this Movie was bad. I\u2019ve been a Star Wars fan my entire life\\, and I loved this movie. It was great. A few scenes were eh but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoy it. It was not predictable. Much than The Force Awakens\\, in my opinion. Don\u2019t let the bad reviews stop you from seeing it. My VERY CRITICAL (especially with movies) fianc\u00e9 loved it and he hated TFA... so... give it a chance! Well done\\, Director Rian Johnson.
