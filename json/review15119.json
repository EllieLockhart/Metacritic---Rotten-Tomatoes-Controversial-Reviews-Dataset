Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it. A little long but overall one of the best films this year bar ragnarok. I enjoyed the humour. Though the bits between Ray and Ben were really good. Mark hamilton performance was excellent. Wouldn't bother reviewing but this amount of backlash has made me sign up.","true":true}
