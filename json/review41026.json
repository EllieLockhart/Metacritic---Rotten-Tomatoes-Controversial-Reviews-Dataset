Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie feels like they focused only on visuals ... and completly forgot to have an actual plot that makes sense. It looks great visualy\\, but OMG plot holes are distracting\/confusing. Also\\, just like episode 7\\, the fact that 'Rey' is basicly good at everything without having any real training or hardship to overcome really takes away from the immersion for me.","true":true}
