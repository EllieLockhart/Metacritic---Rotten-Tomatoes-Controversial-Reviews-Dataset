Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Falls Flat\\n\\nThis new Star Wars is too long and really drags in the majority of the film. It erases many of the more interesting characters left in the Star Wars universe and what it leaves is worrying for the final movie in this trilogy. I f you're a Star Wars fan this will be disappointing for you.","true":true}
