Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has nearly KILLED the stars wars universe for me\\, not bothered about seeing the next episode too much. Just trying to wipe this movie from my mind and live in a world where is it doesn't exist. So many plot holes and CHEAP laughs. Not going to point fingers but you do have to wonder how much Disney interfered in the direction and story.  The music and effects were on point but STILL can't give it a higher score as I feel this movie not only ruined the old characters but some of the new ones as well.\\nShame\\, I hope JJ turns this around somehow\\, and that THIS is the only bad episode of the trilogy.","true":true}
