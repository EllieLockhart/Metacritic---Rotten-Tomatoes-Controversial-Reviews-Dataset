Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi does a massive disservice to the established characters especially Luke. It's empire strikes back 2.0 in reverse. This is a Star Wars that anyone who is deep into the lore of Star Wars would hate.","true":true}
