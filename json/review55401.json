Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account just to comment. Visually stunning -yes. Beyond that the writing is horrible. Abrams set the table nicely. Hence all the anticipation. Johnson dropped the ball and the franchise now seems lost. Episode IX will have trouble getting a large audience\\, just like Attack of the Clones did following the disastrous Phantom Menace. This movie will not survive the initial excitement over it. I don't know how they recover it from this. Others have already articulated why vey clearly. Those who love this movie are paying attention only to the aesthetics. I wish the story matched. I was really wanting to love this movie and kept waiting for it to take a redeeming turn.  It never does. I am sad to say I have no hope and no interest left in the series. The total box office will be about 2\/3 of TFA.  Started close opening weekend and has since dropped like a rock in comparison which means far less repeat viewers. They could have put monkeys picking each other's noses on screen and this still would have had those huge initial numbers. Disney can kiss that goodbye.  Next one will be much lower.  There is no story or character to be invested in any longer.","true":true}
