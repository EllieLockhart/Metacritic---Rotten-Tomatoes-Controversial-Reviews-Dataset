Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They should have called it Star Wars: The Last Trilogy because this is the end for me of sitting through this ridiculous 6 or 7 year process only to be disappointed. I've seen this twice and have no doubt it was a mediocre film. If they had only spent more time with Rey\\, Luke and Kylo Ren and had the final scene be with Snoke they would have had something\\, but this new director went for total shock value and destroyed a lot of storylines in ways that had no impact - except for Leia. He went out of his way to save Leia from the jaws of death even though the audience would have accepted that she died in the movie since she died in real life. A real head scratcher. And it's not like he saved her because she had some compelling role to play in the remainder of the film. NOPE! I see no reason for an Episode 9 and have no more interest in watching \\\"Trilogies\\\". \\n\\nPS Dear Disney\\, light speed is not a weapon\\, lasers don't have arced trajectories like canons and please keep you anti capitalist\\, animal rights claptrap out of films. Thanks!","true":true}
