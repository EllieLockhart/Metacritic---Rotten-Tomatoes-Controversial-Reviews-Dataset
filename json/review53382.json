Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Difficult to know where to start with this mess.\\n\\nAs someone approaching the 40th anniversary of their first viewing of Star Wars this film has disappointed me like no other.\\n\\nI won't list all the faults in this hot mess\\, as that has been expertly dune by many many other reviewers.\\n\\nWhat does Tick me off that every positive review berate  those that dislike it as being stuck in the past etc. \\n\\nI don't need some millennial snow flake to tell me what to like\\, and that this bold direction of Johnson's is fresh and unexpected blah blah.\\n\\nSorry it is simply poorly written trash\\, please explanation to me what this 'new direction' is? All I see is a ridiculous\\, over long pile of nonsense with enough plot holes to gag a wookiee\\n\\nThis is a trilogy\\, it isn't 'clever' writing to just ignore all the plot points from TFA\\, it's rank bad movie making.\\n\\nThe humour is just cringe worthy and not funny at all in the most part.\\n\\nRian Johnson has basically just given a FU to Star Wars fans and left absolute nothing for JJ to when in for episode 9 that I now have zero interest in.\\n\\nIf the box office drop off continues as reported this may not make the giant profit that Disney expect\\, that is the only way Johnson will have the next trilogy stripped from him\\, he should be allowed nowhere near it\\, not that Disney care about anything but money anyway.","true":true}
