Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an excellent addition to the Starwars franchise. At times it felt as though there was just far to much going on and I would have changed many things.  The pacing was good\\,  it was always entertaining and fun\\, never predictable\\,  and in the end it was a true Star Wars film.  For those reasons I say it was a great film and I will enjoy it again and again.  Yes\\,  Luke made stupid decisions\\,  Leia deserved a decent send off\\, and I would have liked to have had a more well defined family history for Rey.  However\\, If it would have been what I predicted\\,  I wouldn't be so frustrated or entertained after my first viewing. I have so many questions\\, so many things i loved\\, so many things i hated. Can't wait to see what JJ Abrams brings to the next film and the future of Star wars.","true":true}
