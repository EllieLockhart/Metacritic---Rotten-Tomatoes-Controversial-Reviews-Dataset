Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Think back to when only the original trilogy existed.\\nIf someone told you that in the year 2017 they'd make a film where Leia flies through space and Luke becomes an old petulant preteen coward\\, you'd laugh! No one would be that stupid\\, right? Well\\, apparently Rian Johnson is precisely that stupid.\\n\\nBut the absolute worst thing about this movie is ROSE!\\nHow did they ever come up with a character that annoying??\\nWhat pit did she crawl out off?? Think Jar Jar Binks is annoying? He aint got nothing on ROSE! Even the orgs are less annoying! \\nOnly character that comes close to being as annoying is that woman with mauve hair.","true":true}
