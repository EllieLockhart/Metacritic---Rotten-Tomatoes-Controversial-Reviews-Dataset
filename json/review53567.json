Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Expect the unexpected! Many people seem to have expected it to go exactly the direction they thought it would go\\, however it gives mind blowing plot twists that keep some on the edge of their seat not knowing what to expect. Beautifully directed with scenes that leave you in awe and very well done writing with a delightful dash of comedy. Its everything I never knew I wanted in a star wars movie.","true":true}
