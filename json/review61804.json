Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First of all on the hardest difficulty i had no trouble finishing it in roughly 22 hours so 30 35 hours is an over estimation. Graphics are very good\\, sound and level design is very good\\, yet i found gameplay weaker than the first game\\, less precise melee combat and it is always the same thing\\, bad guys search for you\\, you shoot them from a safe point\\, or do stealth.

I loved zombie parts and it is fun when they are around but they generally aren't. Story is very very bad written\\, so much questionable scenes that does not make any sense\\, if you have replayed TLOU1 just a few days ago this is even more disturbing\\, most actions of the characters does not make any sense and so out of their character. You will spend some hours very boringly with zero action\\, plot holes in the story makes you dont want to go on. The ending is sooooooo bad and bleak it literally spits on all the hours you spent in the game and as the credits roll you have a big 'F you thats why' feeling. The developers clearly aimed to make you think and say to yourself 'maybe i should not go on' and this is exaclty what you need to do. Instead of paying the game and regretting as i did and going through the end just to regret more\\, don't buy it. Buy Doom Eternal\\, buy RDR2 if you haven't\\, buy GoW\\, keep your money fpr Ghost of Tsushima\\, but if you decide to but this game non the less\\, then get ready to regret every penny you have wasted.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
