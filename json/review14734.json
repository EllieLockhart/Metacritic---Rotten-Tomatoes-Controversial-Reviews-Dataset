Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea why only 57 percent of users are rating this as a good movie. We loved it. To me this was much better than the Force Awakens. I agree with the more than 80\\,000 IMDB users that have it at an 8\/10. This is a rare instance that I agree with the critics more than the users . ","true":true}
