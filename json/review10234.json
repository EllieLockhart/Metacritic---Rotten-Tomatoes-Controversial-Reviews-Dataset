Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. I love the risks that Star Wars and Rian Johnson takes in the film. There were a few parts of the storyline that were slow and could have been done better. I thought the whole relationship with Finn and Rose was forced and would have liked to see more Rey and Finn. I absolutely loved Rey and Kylo's chemistry in this one though! And the new places they explored with the force were all awesome.","true":true}
