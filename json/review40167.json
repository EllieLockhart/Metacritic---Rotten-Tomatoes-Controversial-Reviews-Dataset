Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not so much a movie as it is cinematic audience trolling. The production value is as good as one might expect from a movie with so much money behind it. However\\, the writing is terrible. The story is nearly non-existent\\, and the original story line from the original trilogy has been corrupted and turned into something that is Star Wars in name only. \\nLuckily I was able to watch The Last Jedi on an international flight and didn't have to pay for such an unpleasant experience.","true":true}
