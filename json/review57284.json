Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a HUGE disappointment for me.  A bad Star Wars movie is still a good\\, entertaining movie but for a Star Wars movie\\, I place this 2nd worst besides Episode II.  There so many reasons this movie sucks.  Superfluous characters and subplots.  Idiotic plot holes (hello\\, you can't drop gravity bombs in space\\, what they are electromagnetic?\\, then you don't need to get \\\"over\\\" your target)(fly a ship through the big New Order vessel?\\, try leading with that)(a whole long chase scene? Han Solo can take the Falcon out of hyperspace in the short distance of a moon's atmosphere\\, just hyperspace in front of them\\, duh!)\\, etc.etc.  Throwing away stuff that has been built up (who is Snoke and how did he come to power? who cares\\, he's dead already!).  Squandered opportunities (fight between Fin and Captain Phasma is like 2 seconds\\, WTF?)(almost no light saber duels).  Ridiculous retconning (you don't need to train for years to be. Jedi\\, Rey is a force expert with no training at all; Yoda can just come along and shoot force lightning\\, where was he when Palpatine was trying to kill Luke Skywalker?; did I mention flying a ship through a vessel? makes it a lot easier to blow up a Death Star).  But the biggest travesty is how they treated Luke Skywalker's character.  He was totally wasted and betrayed.  Also\\, how pitiful the resistance is\\, they have accomplished nothing since the first Trilogy\\, they are worse off than before. The more I think about it\\, the angrier I get.  Then to top it off\\, they harp on this theme of letting go of the past.  Yeah\\, the past when Star Wars movies where great.  This movie is garbage.","true":true}
