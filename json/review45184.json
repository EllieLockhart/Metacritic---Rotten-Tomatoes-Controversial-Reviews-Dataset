Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike its predecessor\\, this film takes chances and adds refreshingly new feel to the saga while still giving a comfortable familiarity. Great acting and action. Only problem with the film were the subplots which were tedious and dull. The film could have cut a lot of stuff out\\, but the main story is great. Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver deliver in each of their performances. The highs of this film make it worth seeing again and again.","true":true}
