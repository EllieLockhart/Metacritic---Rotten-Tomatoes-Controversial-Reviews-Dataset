Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"N\u00e3o tem spoilers. S\u00f3 um breve coment\u00e1rio. The Last Jedi \u00e9 muito emocionante. Mas desapontante tamb\u00e9m. N\u00e3o \u00e9 um mau filme... mas est\u00e1 longe de ser excelente . Os personagens novos desta trilogia s\u00e3o completamente descart\u00e1veis e esquec\u00edveis (aproveita-se a Rey\\, ok). O subplot do Finn n\u00e3o tem sentido nenhum (parece um filme \u00e0 parte\\, mesmo visualmente falando). Valha-nos o Luke e a Leia que salvam isto... outra vez. Mas esta trilogia n\u00e3o poder\u00e1 depender deles para sempre\\, certo? Queria mais\\, muito mas mesmo muito mais. Em 2015 sa\u00ed do The Force Awakens no auge e neste sa\u00ed entre o \\\"ok\\\" e o \\\"est\u00e1 bem\\\".","true":false}
