Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a HUGE Star Wars fan...but this movie failed to even meet expectations. I'm so disappointed. Disappointed with Disney and mostly with LucasFilm for allowing this movie to be SO influenced by Disney that its lost its roots. everywhere you turn its poor plot in a galaxy full of opportunity. Disney is going to ruin Star Wars if they cant let the films stay rooted in its origins of timeless themes....the struggle between good and evil. Leave out all the subtle shots at the cultural issues of our day. And fight Disney on its requirements to force cute cudly animals in the film in order to have toys to sell. Stop wasting film time on useless clips (casino) that simply dumb down the movie. Such a sorely disappointing effort. I've never been so let down by a flick. 1st time writing a review...but felt so compelled that I had to submit this review.","true":true}
