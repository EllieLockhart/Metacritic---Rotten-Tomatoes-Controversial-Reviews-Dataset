Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson created the most artistically satisfying entry into the Star Wars Saga; it isn't for everyone\\, due to the bold choices it chooses to make with characters and themes\\, but that doesn't effect the quality of the movie\\, which is outstanding. The story at times dwindles\\, with some comedic moments feeling misjudged; but for every questionable choice\\, there are a dozen breathtaking visuals to pull you straight back into the action. This film has it's issues\\, granted\\, but it takes chances that no other Star Wars movie would dare to make. \\n\\nIt perhaps doesn't feel like the heir apparent to The Force Awakens\\, but elevates the franchise into new ground and at it's best\\, holds a mirror up to the world we live in today and asks us to strive for something more.","true":true}
