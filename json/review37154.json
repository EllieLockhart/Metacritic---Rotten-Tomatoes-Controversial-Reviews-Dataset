Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason to like this movie is as a proxy fight for your misguided political agenda. The story is poorly constructed and gives a jarring experience. There is active anti-consistency with the rest of the series. The entire thing is really embarrassing.","true":true}
