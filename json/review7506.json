Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every character is stupid and none of their actions make any sense. And to top it off... Super long & boring. This is NOT Star Wars. This is feminist propaganda disguised as Star Wars.","true":true}
