Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The low-speed 2 hour chase made me feel like I was watching the OJ Simpson\\, white bronco\\, chase all over again.  I kept wondering why the bad guys didn't just send a couple of ships in hyperspace (sorry\\, light speed) ahead of the rebels and blow them to bits.  And then Laura Dern\\, with her purple hair\\, destroys the bad guys' fleet with one ship going into hyperspace (sorry\\, light speed).  It's too bad the rebels didn't know you could do this in the previous movies.  They could've just blown up all three death stars with one ship each.  Overall\\, this movie was a very loud collection of logic errors and plot holes\\, with a few decent parts here and there.","true":true}
