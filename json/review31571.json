Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much lost potential..... There is so much more to Star Wars than what this film shows and it's sad so many highly praised individuals and a 200 million dollar budget failed to blow my imagination away.","true":true}
