Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Im getting straight to the point I don't like the gameplay\\, story and overall how the game makes me feel. There are certain parts in the game where it makes the player feel bad for playing it and thats just not okay. Examples are when Elllie is forced to kill the dog and when you play as Abby trying to kill Ellie. These just make me want to drop my controller and walk away. I also definitely don't want to play as Abby for about 10 hours because you could say anything about her and I still won't sympathize for her. And the ending was so out of place for Elllie's character\\, she definitely wouldn't have let Abby live and if you wanted that at least make it an option to kill her because now the story just kinda seems meaningless. You go and avenge Joel but in the end you don't even kill who kills him?Also how this game tries to make you like Abby so bad is sad it comes to a point where its just super manipulative and obvious. Also im just gonna say this now what the hell was that article before the game came out that says that you dont have to kill dogs??? You are forced to kill a dog as Ellie which is stupid because no one wants to do that and it just seems out of character for Ellie\\, also how you play as Abby and you get to pet that same dog you kill and play with it... yeah I saw that its super manipulative and stupid. And just to top off my review the trailers for this game are so misleading its terrible\\, Naughty Dog used Joel as a marketing figure by adding him in cut scenes when he was already dead and in game he's not even in the scene and thats just scummy. This is a definite no in my book and the game honesty deserves the bad ratings. But if you like the game or you feel that you'll like it go for it but I'd at least watch some gameplay first so you know what you're getting into.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
