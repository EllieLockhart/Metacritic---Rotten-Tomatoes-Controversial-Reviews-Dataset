Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars VIII is a triumph.  I understand why some didn't like it\\, some who consider themselves purists of the SW universe.  But I enjoyed it\\, and then watched it again with two of my children and their friend.  That's when I realized - it was their gasps of amazement\\, sheer uncontrollable joy at key moments\\, awe at the epic scale of some of the things going on\\, hysterics at some of the events.   These children were the same age I was when I first watched Star Wars Episode IV - and the wonder was the same too.  This movie breaks things yes\\, but it's supposed too.  Luke and Ben are right - it is time to let old things die\\, like the feeling of ownership we may have over this wonderful universe.  OK so they put some bad (easily recreatable for merchandising) puffins in it - for like 30 seconds total.  I love that none of the big plans turn out right\\, I love that super villains are suddenly no-one\\, and so are heroes.  I love that heroes get things wrong.  This is the film that is a dark time for the rebellion\\, and it reflects that without being miserable\\, sombre\\, or unexciting.  The rule book has been ripped up and this is up there as one of my favourite Star Wars films - but far\\, far more importantly - it is certainly my childrens favourite and it's a joy to me that they were just wowed by Star Wars just as much as I was all those years ago\\, in a galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
