Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Make all the interesting characters die\\, add boring scenes\\, kill more baddies we liked\\, make sure you keep the dull guys\\, add a bit a cringe\\, and you get that perfect Christmas recipe to upset all the fans. Well done Disney!","true":true}
