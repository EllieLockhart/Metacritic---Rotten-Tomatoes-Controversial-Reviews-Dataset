Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok listen up.

This game is a Masterpiece\\, a real piece of art. It goes beyond what the haters and whiners see at the surface.The gameplay is improved over the first part by a lot and makes you explore more which makes finding secrets more rewarding.Music is amazing just like the first entry\\, and also as it is to be expected has some pretty amazing visuals.Now on to what everyone complaints about...  The story.Most people complaining have either not played the game and had a part of the story spoiled or have played the game and not finish it..This game will not tell the story you want it to tell\\, that is true\\, but that is also true for life itself. The game does a wonderful job with narrative\\, deep and complex emotions\\, amazing support characters and relationships\\, dichotomy and duality\\,  and twists and surprises that ultimately reflect human behaviour.This game goes to show that this is not a fantasy world where everyone is happy\\, **** happens and how you deal with that and the journey you go through. Also\\, in case people did not understand it after playing part 1\\, you are not playing a hero\\, you are not playing as the good guy\\, you never have in TLOU.SummaryNaughty dog continued its trajectory of great story telling and amazing characters all within the world that we all love although this experience may not feel much of a \\\"zombie game\\\"\\,  with the great little touches to the gameplay and music makes this the best work Naughty dog has brought to the industry in as an art form\u2026 Expand","true":true}
