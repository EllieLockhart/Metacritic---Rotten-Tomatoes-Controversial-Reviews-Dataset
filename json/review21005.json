Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was not happy with this movie at all. It will be the last Star Wars I go see on opening night as this is the second year in a row I have been disappointed. I will wait till they come out on DVD from now on.","true":true}
