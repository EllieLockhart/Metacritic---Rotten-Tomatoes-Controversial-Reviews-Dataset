Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens\\, Last Jedi Trailers\\, and big critics added the hype...and the viewing blew it all apart.  \\n\\nLeaving the theater\\, two words stuck with me: SOULLESS and STORY-LESS.  \\n\\nThe ONE positive thing about Last Jedi (ok two things\\, because Mark Hamil was great) is that Star Wars fans leave with a new appreciation of Episodes I\\, II\\, and III.  Lucas at least wrote compelling STORIES for those films\\, and they contained the MAGIC of Star Wars.  \\n\\nI actually felt the entire audience grow uncomfortable when Lei floats back into a ship.  In another scene\\, I find myself asking: \\\"OK...so they're in a death-defying slow-chase with the New Order\\, yet they can just sneak into a small ship and pop off across the galaxy to a planet to get some guy to sneak onto the First Order Ship?  Are you KIDDING ME?\\\"\\n\\nThis film leaves you wanting to abandon \\\"Disney's Star Wars\\\" forever because you'll hate yourself for feeding them $$$ for name-brand-crap\\, but you also know when J.J. Abrams comes back\\, you'll have to go see it.","true":true}
