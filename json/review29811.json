Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right up with Empire as the best in the saga! It's new\\, unknown\\, and fresh and that makes it terrifying to longtime Star Wars fans like me\\, and because of that\\, Star Wars is awesome again. Who cares that Snoke isn't the big bad like the Emperor\\, and Luke the uncompromising good like Yoda\/Obi-Wan in the original trilogy. For the first time\\, the sides aren't black and white\\, and we have no idea what is coming next. It's awesome. Forget the bad reviews and make an opinion yourself.","true":true}
