Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big Star Wars fan I went into this movie with no expectations.  I did say if it was a shot for shot remake of ESB I'm walking out and thankfully it was not.  It takes what we know and love about Star Wars and keeps the story going.  I really liked the special and practical effects as well as those few suspenseful moments that had the audience holding their breath. It's great\\, it's Star Wars.","true":true}
