{"101487":149740,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start with saying I'm not a huge Star Wars fan\\, I enjoyed The Empire Strikes Back\\, the Return of the Jedi and in some parts the Revenge of the Sith. I didn't like The Force Awakens or Rogue One at all based on how predicable they were\\, how lazy the writing was and how boring the main characters were. The one joy I took from Rogue One was that all the characters died so I knew I'd never have to see them again\\, unlike with the main Star Wars feature. \\n\\nWhat I will praise The Last Jedi for is the sound\\, music and visuals. If I were rating just on those I'd be giving this 5\/5 for certain\\, these elements are so good they manipulate people into thinking the film is so much better than it actually is.\\n\\nWhat I hated most was all the things I thought were going to happen...happened. I don't want to be able to so easily guess the entire plot before I watch a film and with this I nailed it. Rey\\, Finn and Poe are just insanely boring to watch as characters\\, the actors don't convince me that these people are in the same universe as the one I'm supposed to be watching. The attempts at humour are shockingly poor\\, the only way a character can be funny is if they actor is funny\\, Boyega is not this for sure\\, and the painful thing is because he landed the part of Finn we're going to have to suffer him in many more films in the upcoming future.  I'm not even going to start on Ridley\\, she's even worse. \\n\\nAnother huge problem with The Last Jedi is that it just feels inconsistent\\, and right now so many people have their hands in Star Wars that it's no longer one persons vision and story. I have an image of a bunch of pandering idiots in a room agreeing to stupid ideas and basically just creating the nonsense witnessed in the Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe flow was terrible\\, I shouldn't be wanting a film I paid to watch to end quickly but with this I couldn't wait. I've not watched the directors work before and I won't again any time soon.\\n\\nEverything wrong with The Last Jedi is everything wrong with films at the moment. People are taking a creatives persons work and adding their own touches to it\\, but there're too many people with too many touches. The lack of creativity is insulting\\, I imagine the high score from the critics is just people sucking up because The Last Jedi was so bad I created an account to express my hatred of it. I hoped it was going to be an improvement on Rogue One and The Farce Awakens but I was very wrong. If like me you're just a slight fan of Star Wars\\, just wait for it to hit Netflix or something. I've decided I'm not going to watch any new Star Wars films\\, they don't deserve my time.","true":true}
