Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mess of a film. Finn felt irrelevant \\, Snoke was weak\\, Reys training\\, Lukes awful portrayal I could go on. But what I loved about the film was Poe\\, Leia and Kylo. Would I reccomend seeing it ? Wait for the DVD.","true":true}
