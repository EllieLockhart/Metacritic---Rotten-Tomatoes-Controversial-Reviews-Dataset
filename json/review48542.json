Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Woooow. This movie is so dope. Even non lovers will enjoy this movie. No clue why the rating is so low. I left this movie kinda blown away. Great story. I thought things were gonna go in a different direction. It ended up going where you are absolutely rooting for Rey and the rebels. I thought for sure she was turning to the dark side hahaha. Overall I really feel as a Star Wars lover that this has to be top 2 in the series. Loved It. ","true":true}
