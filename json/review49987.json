Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You thought the prequels were bad. At least they gave us excitement and wonder. This is just the equivalent of hipster filmmakers trying to be different and change what the Star Wars we grew up with is. Shame shame shame. Not worth a second watch.","true":true}
