Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching this movie in the cinema is a experience and that's why I'm giving it this rating. I couldn't really find any substance to the movie with all the plot holes and gaps in logically story telling.\\n\\nThat being said\\, I can see how people enjoyed this movie for the cinematography\\, the visuals and sounds were on point.\\n\\nThat's not enough to get me to rewatch it and that's how I know a movie is good\\, when I leave the theatre I have a feeling that I wouldn't mind paying admission again to go back and see another screening.\\n\\nThe best analogy for this movie would be going on a blind date with a very beautiful woman\\, you're excited at the beginning but as the date goes on you slowly find out that she has no personality and it completely superficial.","true":true}
