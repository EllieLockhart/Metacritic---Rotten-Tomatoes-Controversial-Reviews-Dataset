Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this movie\\, considering I've seen it four times.  What a ride.  I've always had faith in King Rian Johnson\\, and he proved his worth with this Stars Wars movie-that-also-wasn't-a-Star-Wars-movie.  He has an eye for detail.  Daisy Ridley really had her chance to shine in Episode IIX.  Everything just worked\\, and don't get me started on Porgs.  BRING BACK JOHNSON FOR EPISODE IX!!!","true":true}
