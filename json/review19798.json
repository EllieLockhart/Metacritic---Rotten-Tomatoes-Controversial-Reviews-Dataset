Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a really awesome\\, really action-packed and really entertaining Star Wars movie. It had really amazing special effects\\, really awesome music\\, really exceptional cast\\, really terrific cinematography\\, really wonderful characters\\, really exciting adventure\\, really breathtaking action\\, really fabulous humor\\, really wonderful costumes\\, really well done makeup and a really interesting storyline. It\u2019s one of the best Star Wars movies I\u2019ve ever seen in my whole life. I highly recommend this movie to old and new \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans of all ages.","true":true}
