Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"they've irretrievably sabotaged this new trilogy. i'm not really seeing a way back from what they did in this. Unless maybe Vade and Luke come back as force wraiths to chop seven shades of shit out of Brian Johnson.","true":true}
