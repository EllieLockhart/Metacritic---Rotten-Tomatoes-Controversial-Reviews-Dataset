Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who grew up with Luke Skywalker as one of the greatest big screen heroes of my generation\\, I have to admit I was looking forward to seeing him on the big screen again for the first time in 34 years\\, especially after the let down of only getting a glimpse of him in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nSadly\\, I did not see Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi.  Rian Johnson decided to give us a new character\\, Jake Skywalker.  Sure\\, in the movie he went by Luke.  He looks like an older Luke\\, but his behavior is something right out of Invasion of the Body Snachers.  \\n\\nMy first thought at seeing this new Luke made me think\\, there must be some HUUGE explanation as to why Luke has become a curmudgeonly recluse.  Dear friends\\, there is no such moment.  In fact\\, the explanation given is absurd.  Truly and utterly absurd.\\n\\n I'm sure many fans will like this new character.  Unfortunately\\, I cannot.  Why?  Because I cared about the old Luke Skywalker too much to enjoy Jake Skywalker\\, the snarky Don Rickles of the Jedi Order.\\n\\nThere are many other problems with this movie.  It is political\\, it is preachy\\, it wastes interesting characters.  Honestly\\, I have very little interest in seeing the next film.  I am not going to think about what's next .\\n\\nMoviegoers that aren't Star Wars fans may enjoy this film.  However\\, for those of us who grew up with the mythology\\, this movie is terribly disappointing.  If you\\, like me\\, were looking forward to seeking Luke Skywalker\\, I feel your pain.","true":true}
