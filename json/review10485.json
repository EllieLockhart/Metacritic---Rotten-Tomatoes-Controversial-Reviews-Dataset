Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great sp\u00e9cial effects-  but story was predictable and admittedly too focused on making us like the \\\"new\\\" characters.... news flash\\, however\\, these new characters not only aren't likeable\\, but have none of the magic that the original characters had\\, including chemistry with one another.  This movie makes the prequel trilogy look amazing with it's much better casting.","true":true}
