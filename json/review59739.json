Enjoyed the story\\, gameplay of it was not up to dates standards\\, but storywise there were the expectations: Lots of deep stuff between Joel and Ellie and the state where it ended was kind of tense and I really wanted to know how this continues from this.\r\rReality:\r\rWhole game feels like standalone. It did not really continue from the ending of the part 1. Somehow all those things that were open and interesting at the end kind of disappeared. Just feels like that this was not part 2. It was just kind of same characters that are changed from the part 1 and used for \\\"hollywood standard plot\\\". Gameplay was almost identical or even more mundane than the part 1.\r\rGraphics were best I have seen\\, but as some streamed noted: Good graphics are kind of wasted when the game is not enjoyable itself.\r\rConclusion:\r\rIf you are looking for spiritual second part of last of us part 1. This is not it. You can think it as basic gameplay of part 1 with hollywood movie level plot and it doesnt really continue from the part 1. Its like other timeline where the personalities are different and none of the questions are rightfully answered or developed that are left after part 1.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
