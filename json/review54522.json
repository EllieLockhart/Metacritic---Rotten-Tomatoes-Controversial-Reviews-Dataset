Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm absolutely not a star wars fanboy but this film had me seething with anger when I wasn't bored to death. There is a total lack of continuity between the this\\, the force awakens\\, the original trilogy\\, and the basic laws of physics which is disrespectful and absurd. \\n\\nLuke is not Luke. Leia is not Leia but a zombie Mary Poppins. There are no characters with any gravitas or screen presence to allow disbelief at all the idiotic aspects to be suspended. The wrong people are killed off and the right people are killed off in the wrong ways. Every female character is strong and independent. Every male character is either farcical\\, cowardly\\, duplicitous\\, emo teenager or simply a plot device to make the female characters look more sage and strong. Had the roles been reversed this would surely have been perceived as being misogynistic.\\n\\nThe second act is numbingly dull with plot arcs that are boring\\, absurd add nothing to the main thread. It wastes existing character's\\, adds new ones you just can't care about and exist only for Disney to sell toys to kids. While visually stunning in part\\, some of the cgi is unbearably bad.\\n\\nThe last 30 mins of the third act gives hope that the 2 hour mess that went before it might have been all worth it\\, but this turns out to be just the thinnest veneer of lubricant applied to one of  biggest f*** you's ever committed to film. \\n\\nPart carry on film\\, part watching paint dry\\, part Disney toy advert and part having all your hopes and dreams torn apart\\, eaten by a Bantha and s**t out again\\, this film isn't just bad it's offensive not just simply to star wars fans\\, but also to fans of coherence and storytelling.","true":true}
