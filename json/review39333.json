Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an unfocused mess\\, whose attempts to break free of what it obviously considers the millstone of the original trilogy\u2019s lore and chart a new course come off as needlessly irreverent and hollow. It simultaneously squanders the promise and goodwill of The Force Awakens while failing to shore up its predecessor\u2019s shortcomings. Full of narrative cul-de-sacs and baffling missed opportunities that see key characters treading water\\, some truly bizarre innovations\\, and an insistence on second-rate pop culture jokes that consistently undermine the emotional weight the movie seeks to achieve\\, it gives one reason to wonder whether Rian Johnson truly understands or even loves Star Wars.","true":true}
