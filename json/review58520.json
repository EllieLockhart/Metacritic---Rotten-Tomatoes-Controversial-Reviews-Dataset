I decided to purchase this game anyway and I\u2019m glad I did. I have played it beginning to end\\, and I feel it rates a 10\\, as I feel it is a masterpiece and a game I will replay for years to come\\, just as I did with the first one. I do understand why fans are upset\\, but I would recommend to anyone on the fence about this game to play through it once with an open mind. It ties in well with the first game and I ended up liking all (well\\, almost all) of the new characters. It did upset me terribly to see what eventually happened to characters I loved from the first game\\, but I understand why the tragedies that befell them happened in the manner that they did. This is a harsh and unforgiving world where there is a reaction to every action and the line between good and bad is blurred repeatedly. Does this game have a political agenda informed by a feminist\\, gay\\, trans\\, woke agenda? Sure. Does that bother me? In some ways yes and in some ways no. Did they kill off one of my all-time favorite characters who happens to be the antithesis of all those things? Yes and graphically. Was I happy with all the narrative choices Naughty Dog made? No. But this is a damn good game with a damn good story and I enjoyed it immensely because it made me feel a wide array of emotions\\, and\\, simply put\\, it entertained me. For $59.99\\, that\u2019s a good deal to me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
