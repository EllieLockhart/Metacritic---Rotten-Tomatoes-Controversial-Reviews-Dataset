Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this movie on Christmas Eve. The story may have a few flaws\\, but honestly\\, it may be the same tone like The Empire Strikes Back\\, but the storyline is so ORIGINAL and the action scenes is great! The dark tone is what kept me satisfied about the movie!","true":true}
