Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No fan service! So glad they didn't play into all the theories people were coming up with leading up to this. It made it so much better. Less predictable and more surprising. Definitely one of my favorite episodes out of all of them. Can't wait for EP 9!","true":true}
