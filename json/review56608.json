Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn't a complete disaster: it has some spectacular new worlds\\, characters\\, and visuals. I\\, for one\\, am not a troll angry at the diversity present in both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. (I'm sorry...I believe they're calling the Empire \\\"The First Order\\\" now. Have they given the Rebel Alliance a new name yet? Same old things\\, new names.)\\n\\nAside from abundant illogicalities and plot holes\\, my biggest complaint with this film is that it refutes the conclusion of Return of the Jedi. Now\\, I may have misread the ending of RotJ\\, but if I am not mistaken\\, the Rebel Alliance DEFEATED the Galactic Empire. Now the Empire is back\\, with a new dark lord and a new name. And the Rebel Alliance\\, rather than ruling the galaxy are\\, well...a rebel alliance. Nothing has changed. Why? \\n\\nNot only that\\, but Luke used the Force and the Jedi code to find goodness and strength in himself and his father. Now he resents all that\\, and concludes that the Jedi are part of the problem. Why? He was a childhood hero for many; now he is a bitter old man. Why?\\n\\nNothing has changed in this war; they've simply rebooted it. I wanted so badly for Rey to join Ren and for Finn to die\\, because at least something would have CHANGED. We're simply back where the entire saga began: rebels on the run from the Empire\\, Jedis virtually wiped out. You could name Episode IX \\\"A New Hope\\\" at this point and it would make complete sense. (Although technically\\, Episode VII was \\\"A New Hope\\\" V2.0.) We've all seen this episode before\\, 8 times now.\\n\\nTwo lines from the film are particularly meaningful. First\\, DJ argues that the war continues because of the people who profit from it. In context\\, he's referring to manufacturers of weapons\\, but on a meta level he's referring to Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). They are the profiteers who will never let this war change.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the second meaningful line from Episode VIII: \\\"It's time for the Jedi to end.\\\"","true":true}
