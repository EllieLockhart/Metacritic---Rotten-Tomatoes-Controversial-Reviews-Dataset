Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things annoyed me about this movie. It was too long. Milk scene was a wtf moment. Leia not actually dying. Luke not wanting to train Rey\\, then suddenly being okay with training Rey. Snoke was useless. Rose's character was not good (poorly written). I felt like I really didn't get anything new about Rey's or Finn's characters. The Porgs were cute.","true":true}
