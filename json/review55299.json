Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lets see ... \\n1)  Illogical character decisions.  The movie needs characters to make the dumbest choices to progress the plot.\\n2)  Pointless scenes.  Rose and Finn's plotline was tacked on and added little or nothimg to the actual story.  Did the the script just need to give them busy work?\\n3)  Kylo and Rey's story was fine\\n4)    Still waitimg for an explanation on why Rey is good at everything and doesnt have to struggle for her personal accomplishments.  Everything comes too easily for her ... this is boring.","true":true}
