Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok I'm going to do this right. I played the game in its entirety so I experienced and felt every moment\\, and I can say I'm so disappointed\\, this story is ruining my days.\rFirst of all\\, almost every character is so inconsistent:\r- Joel and Tommy look like the most stupid human beings left on Earth\\, the exact opposite we learnt from TLOU1.  telling some bad strangers their real name and their location is so stupid that even a normal person would avoid.\r- Tommy at first seems that he doesn't even want to seek vengeance because Jackson needs protection and doesn't want to lose anyone else\u2026. but later on the game\\, more precisely at The Farm chapter\\, he thows **** against Ellie just because she momentanely says she has abandoned her mission of Revenge. WTF? Tommy cares about Ellie a lot and knows how much Joel cared about her\u2026. he would never act like that.\r- The end\u2026. Ellie loses EVERYTHING and Abby nothing\u2026. and it's impossibile not to be disappointed. Thart character is so horrible and also they are trying to replace Joel and Ellie with Abby and Lev. Such a great potential incredibly ruined\u2026.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
