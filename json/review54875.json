Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an excellent movie. Sure there are some things I would have liked to be done differently\\, but all in all it changed the way Star Wars works and ensured we won't have another original trilogy parallel. It was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout\\, there was no plot armor and it was incredible acting on part of the cast\\, especially Mark Hamill and Daisy.","true":true}
