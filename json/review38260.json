Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the whole movie is a very good looking disappointment\\, it killed all the joy and excitement i had with this new trilogy and canon after tfa. i can look over all the silly jokes and even all the plot holes\\, but i cannot forgive how they treated luke skywalker here. better stick with the old extended universe\\, i don't care for this one any more","true":true}
