Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson delivers some great moments in Star Wars The Last Jedi. However\\, many of his decisions hardly pay off and are often treated as plot points that end up being wasted potential. I do not by any means dislike this film to the extent that many fans are going to\\, I do however feel very empty and disappointed after seeing this film and was expected something more impactful. Upon a second viewing I do hope to change my opinion\\, but as of right now this is one of my least favorite Star Wars films. ","true":true}
