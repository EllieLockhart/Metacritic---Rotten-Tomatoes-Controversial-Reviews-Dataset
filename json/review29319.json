Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Disney destroyed the legacy of the Star Wars saga. This was overtly intentional as TLJ plot was clearly a metaphor for that destruction and their desire to start anew.  Star Wars survived on its great story\\, even if the cinematography and acting wasn't always too-notch. This film reversed that trend by having good acting\\, excellent cinematography\\, but a convoluted\\, directionless\\, and non-sensical story.  This film was a terrible mistake.","true":true}
