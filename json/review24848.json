{"101487":155183,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My Episode 8 rant:\\n\\nSpoilers\\n\\nI hated this movie!\\n\\nThere was a lot that didn't need to be in there I felt. Especially that part where Rose and Fin go off by themselves. But hey\\, let's waste time and rescue space horses while our friends and Comrades are literally been slaughtered.\\n\\nAnd apparently both the First Order and the Resistance have the smallest Galactic Fleets in the history of Sci-Fi.\\n\\nI mean really\\, by itself the Rebel Alliance in Return of the Jedi had a larger fleet than the First Order and the Resistance combined. By the way\\, that was the slowest and longest space chase ever.\\n\\nThe kamikaze Hyperspace run although cool\\, retroactively created an impossible plot hole for everything that came before. Why don't crippled ships do\\, kamikaze hyperspace runs against enemy capital ships?\\n\\nThere was way too much indulgent clowning around.\\n\\nHux was a complete dolt.\\n\\nBut you know what really ticks me off? There is no way to undo the worst things done in this movie in a way that the next movie is now stuck with.\\n\\nEven \\\"Attack of the Clones\\\" as awkward and awful as it was (and good grief was it awful)\\, it *didn't* hamstring the next movie into an impossible position (George Lucas let Revenge of the Sith do that by itself ??). I have no idea how they undo everything stupid thing they did with this movie. Frankly\\, it's to the point that I really don't care what the next movie is like. No\\, really\\, I don't care.\\n\\nHonestly\\, even Episode 2 didn't do this.\\n\\nThe sad thing is\\, if they ended the movie earlier\\, like at the part where the Resistance was leaving for the old rebel base\\, the movie would have been worlds better. If the Resistance had safely escaped at that point\\, the movie SHOULD have ended then. That would have opened a door for the next movie to \\\"walk through\\\". Now\\, I don't know\\, or care.\\n\\nThe whole ending with Luke vs Kylo thing was as goofy as all get out and ended anything cool and redeeming about Luke Skywalker. The \\\"Allies\\\" not coming to help was a pointless addition that makes the next movie have to explain why they didn't help the Resistance when it would have really mattered.\\n\\nThe entire ground assault made no sense whatsoever. The reason the Empire did a ground assault in the Empire Strikes Back is because the Rebels had a Planetary shield that was \\\"...strong enough to prevent any bombardment...\\\" So why didn't the First Order just do an orbital bombardment???\\n\\nIt also made the retreat to the planet effectively pointless\\, they flee to the planet\\, just to flee from the planet which makes their second retreat from the First Order now *decidedly* much more tenuous (at best).\\n\\nIn The Empire Strikes Back\\, they had well thought out plot devices to explain how the Rebels got off Hoth\\, Leia herself explained a believable escape strategy to the Rebel pilots escorting the evacuation transports.\\n\\nThis time\\, none of that was in play\\, at all. Not even a little.\\n\\nAlthough I really wanted Rey to turn out to be the daughter of Luke and Mara Jade\\, I was okay with her not being a Skywalker at all\\, it's everything else around it that was awful. I really don't care to see Episode 9 now.\\n\\nBut even taking everything else we have ranted about away\\, there were whole parts of this movie that I was just bored and waiting for SOMETHING interesting to happen.\\n\\nThey should really make a whole new episode 8\\, much like they did with the original Clone Wars cartoon series.\\n\\n#RepealAndReplaceEpisode8","true":true}
