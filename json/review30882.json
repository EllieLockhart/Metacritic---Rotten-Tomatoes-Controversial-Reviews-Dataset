Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, basically\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson and other Disney shills are telling us that it is wrong to go watching a STAR MOVIE expecting to watch a STAR WARS movie.\\nThat tells a lot about their mental health.","true":true}
