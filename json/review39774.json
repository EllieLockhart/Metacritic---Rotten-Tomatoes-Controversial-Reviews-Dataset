Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an absolute abomination. The writing is horrendous and the characters are terrible. If you summarized the plot it would sound like a funny joke. It seems like some Star Trek fan broke in and tried to sabotage all of Star Wars lore. Help Us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope. ","true":true}
