Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you like any of the Star Wars movies you will like this. Some spectacular scenes and shots. There were 3 hooky parts I could have lived with out. But I will see again allot to take in.not sure why all the bashing ","true":true}
