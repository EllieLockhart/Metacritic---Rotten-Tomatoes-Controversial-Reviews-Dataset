Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RIAN RUINED THE STAR WARS SAGA!!!!  Don't believe Ny of these idiotic 4 & 5 star reviews.  Who is Snoke? Doesn't matter because he's dead now. Why is Rey so strong? No idea. She just is because\\, uhh...girl power. Who are the Knights of Ren? No clue. But perhaps the worst injustice is that the film completely kills Luke. Not just in a physical sense. They kill his entire legacy. When Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with everything about his character in this film\\, he wasn't kidding. RiN must not have watched The Force Awakens and who the heck at Disney greenlignted this BS.  I am so angry as a Star Wars fan because it can't be taken back now.","true":true}
