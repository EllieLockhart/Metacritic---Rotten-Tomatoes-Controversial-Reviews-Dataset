Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a waste of potential. Lets just focus on Luke who is a total waste here\\, after more than 30 years waiting for him to return and to see him milk a space sea cow on screen just crushes you. I know Rey is our new Hero but Snoke (another wasted character) and him had to give us the greatest single Jedi \/ Sith confrontation ever seen in the saga. if he had to die sure but give him an Epic death not a Jedi mind trick.
