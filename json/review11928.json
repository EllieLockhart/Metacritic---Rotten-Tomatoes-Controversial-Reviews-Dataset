Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge plotholes\\, was hoping for something better than the first one but it looks like Disney paid off the critics to get a fresh rating given the audience score. I never really see the critics diverge so far from an audience in a positive manner.) I saw it again recently and still stand by\\, this movie was horrible.","true":true}
