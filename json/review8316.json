Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Feels like they tried to create a great movie addressing modern liberal ideas\\, but they failed and totally destroyed the rules that govern Star Wars and I doubt any of the writers bothered to watch the previous movies.","true":true}
