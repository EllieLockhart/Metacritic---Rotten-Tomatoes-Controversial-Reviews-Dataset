Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is Kylo Ren. Let's take one of the most popular and beloved franchises in history\\, shred the mythology to pieces\\, ignore the previous entry\\, and tell the fan base that they are stupid for liking the old movies in the first place. The movie was an overly long\\, absurd CGI fest\\, in need of better editing. Nonsensical atonal plot\\, with no payoffs\\, and no story or character development. Rey is an all powerful Mary Sue and Leia is immortal apparently. The movie is such a parody that I felt like I was watching Spaceballs. Bravo!  It seems like there is a movie missing before episode 7\\, with all of the answers and back story\\, and that this should have been the last in the franchise. Idk how JJ will save it. Rian Johnson wasted a talented cast and completely destroyed the franchise in the process. Political tokenism over substance. Save your money. If I wanted to see a farcical sequel I would've gone to see Jumanji.\\nBad sci-fi movie\\, the worst Star Wars movie.","true":true}
