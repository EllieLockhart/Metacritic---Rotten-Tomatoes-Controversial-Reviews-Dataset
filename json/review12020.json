Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie and it exceeded my expectations. It plays on the theme of dealing with failure and letting go of the past.\\n\\nThere are some SJW moments that will make you roll your eyes but they're brief and have nothing to do with the overall plot.  Finally we have a Star Wars movie that feels different while still feeling like Star Wars.\\n\\nUnlike Force Awakens\\, I left the theater feeling like I was fulfilled rather than feeling empty and left with questions that I could care less about. Without giving out too much spoilers\\, Last Jedi answers those questions in a way that makes the most sense.","true":true}
