Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am capable of forgiving many flaws in a Star Wars movie and still find myself enjoying it. TLJ could have been no different. For everything that I disliked -- the misguided humor\\, the infantilizing of Hux\\, Snoke being killed off\\, Leia in space -- I could have forgiven it if the payoff had been there in the end. \\n\\nHow could there have been so many eyes on this movie\\, from Kathleen Kennedy\\, Bob Iger\\, JJ Abrams\\, and Pablo Hidalgo... for somebody to have NOT screamed at Rian Johnson and said\\, \\\"What are you thinking? Killing Luke Skywalker off without a fight?\\\"\\n\\nMany of us were at peace with Luke's single cameo in TFA because we \\\"knew\\\" that Episode VIII would be Luke's movie. \\n\\nBut \\\"Luke's movie\\\" did not give us him wielding his green lightsaber in action. Imagine\\, for a second\\, him arriving on Crait in his X-Wing... he takes to battle like he did on Tattoine and Endor and confronts Kylo in a dual. Even if Kylo bests him -- or even if he kills Luke -- at least we would have seen Luke in action one more time. Heck\\, even the creators of Battlefront II \\\"got\\\" Luke better than the entire Episode VIII team. \\n\\nNow\\, the opportunity to see Luke battle on screen again is gone forever.  If Rian wanted to be \\\"above\\\" the fans and deny us this one piece of fan service\\, then he at least should have kept Luke alive for the creators of Episode 9. All of us should have taken the warnings from Mark Hamill more seriously\\, who was right in the way he got out in front of this. And\\, although I was not one of them\\, those who griped about the movie before it came out will now feel rightfully vindicated. \\n\\nRian's response to the criticism about Luke has been smug -- saying that he couldn't write a movie with the distraction of giving the fans what they wanted. As if he couldn't have given us the same movie but with Luke's battlefield heroism coming in at the end. Gareth Edwards and Tony Gilroy accomplished this with Rogue One in the final 30 minutes of the movie with Red\/Gold Leader\\, the Tantive IV\\, and Darth Vader being Darth Vader. I wish Edwards had been given the reigns for Episode VIII.","true":true}
