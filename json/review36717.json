Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself is pretty bad; there are no memorable battles (even the prequels had some amazing battles)\\, and the character interactions seem forced as heck.\\nThe best line in the entire movie comes from a character they had to revive for only one scene and for nostalgia vibes.\\n\\nIt is just plainly bad\\, it makes no sense to the original story\\, but I still recommend to watch it; you'll enjoy it if you watch it with a funny perspective\\, because how bad it is.","true":true}
