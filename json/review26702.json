Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok so CGI and colours amazing. Storylines were dreadful. I expected better after journalist reviews said it was as good as the empire strikes back... but wasn't. The next movie must have justice with strong writers such as  James mangold\\, or Alfonso cuaron\\, Guillermo del torro\\, or Bjorn Stein\\, Lana Wachowski to help JJ Abrahams make the next one as good as the originals. Please\\, with strong actors\\, like Kate beckinsale too","true":true}
