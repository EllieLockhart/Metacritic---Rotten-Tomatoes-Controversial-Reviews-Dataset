Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why some fans were disappointed in the direction this movie took and questions left unanswered\\, and to be honest i was a little disappointed at first\\, but the more I thought about it\\, some of those decisions were what made me end up liking it. Its what made it more believable and relatable. You don\u2019t always get what you want. Things don\u2019t always work out wrapped up in a pretty little package. And you don\u2019t always get all the answers right away. Thats life. Keep in mind\\, this trilogy still has another movie to go. Perhaps the things that don\u2019t make sense right now\\, will\\, when that one is released. And the mystery building up to that point will make it all the better.","true":true}
