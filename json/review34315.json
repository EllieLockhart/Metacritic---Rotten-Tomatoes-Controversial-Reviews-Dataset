Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was great but the story writing was just aweful You know all the questions we had set up from TFA? Yeah\\, they disregarded all of those all well writing a story with more plot holes than Snokes face. I couldn't be more disappointed in this aweful writing.","true":true}
