Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I different take on Star Wars and how the story develops. A very spiritual and thought provoking movie which it shows that the teacher isn't always all knowing. Characters are complex and they show their human side with their flaws.\\n\\nThe director took a risk to follow a different path to what the fanboys were expecting and in my opinion it's paid off. I don't want to see a remake of the empire strikes back but sadly that's what people wanted to see. The same old story only in a different shell. For this movie I side with the critics.","true":true}
