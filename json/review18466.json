Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is like the game where one person starts telling a story and then it's passed off to the next person and they do their best to fuck it up... well congratulations Rian Johnson... you fucked up the story... I am okay with things going in a different direction with the franchise... but this timeline was literally seconds after The Force Awakens (which was a brilliant film ) and there was no continuity... there were beautiful moments... the silence was stunning... the red salt was beautiful... but the story was boring... completely contradictory of itself... Finn and Rose were pointless... there was no emotional pull... there was absolutely NO reason to care about the characters... this was one of the most poorly written and thought out movies I have seen in a long time...","true":true}
