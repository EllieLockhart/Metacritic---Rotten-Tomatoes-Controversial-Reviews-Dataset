Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a longtime Star Wars fan\\, I have never been picky about the movies and always happily anticipated the next chapter when I knew there was one.  With the prequels it was until months or years after the fact that I saw some of the flaws\\, and was able to look past them to see the underlying story that builds on the mythology.  With The Last Jedi\\, my first viewing left me feeling a bit...hollow as I left.  I saw it on Thursday and couldn't stop thinking about what it was that made me feel this way.  There were jokes that felt more like they belonged in Marvel movies\\, and tasks like moving rocks around that took some pretty intensive training from Yoda for Luke to get the hang of.  On my second viewing\\, being well aware of the specifics that bother me and had me thinking about them for 2 days\\, I found that I was able to miraculously look past them.  What was left was a good chapter in the saga.  I favored the Force Awakens\\, but I am willing to accept this rather than walk away from Star Wars as I was previously contemplating.","true":true}
