Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just no...no no no no no no no. This movie just insulted the original characters like Luke and Leia by making jackasses and fools out of them. There was so much potential for Rey's and Snoke's backstory and Rian Johnson just tossed it out the window. Same with Kathleen Kennedy\\, I think she only made this movie to appeal to SJW's and her critic friends who'll like anything she puts out in theatres. Star Wars fans were so excited to see what they would do with characters like Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo Ren\\, Snoke\\, Finn\\, and Poe Dameron. They also came together like a family despite political and religious beliefs to see one of their favourite franchises tell a great story\\, only to get a knee in the private parts by SJW propaganda and lazy storytelling. I'm excited to see Solo: A Star Wars Story bomb at this point with it's lazy\\, unnecessary look\\, and it's obvious Guardians Of The Galaxy copycatting.","true":true}
