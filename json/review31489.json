Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some terrible plot decisions by the director and too many cringeworthy gags\\, animals and clunky politicising made this a real disappointment after episode 7 and Rogue One.","true":true}
