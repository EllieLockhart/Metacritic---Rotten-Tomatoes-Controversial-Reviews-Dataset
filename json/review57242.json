Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fails on so many levels. It fails as a Star Wars movie\\, it fails as a sequel to TFA\\, it fails at character development\\, and it fails to be fun. \\n\\nEvery time I watch TLJ I find another thing wrong in the movie so I don't even know where to start with all the problems it has. Even the prequels\\, with all their problems\\, didn't have the utter contempt for Star Wars that this movie has.\\n\\nAll I think that should be said is that this movie just drove modern Star Wars into the ground and we need to stop enabling Lucasfilm and Disney into thinking they are entitled to our money just because they slapped the Star Wars label on a garbage fire like The Last Jedi.","true":true}
