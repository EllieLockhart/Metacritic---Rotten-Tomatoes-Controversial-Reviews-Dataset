Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie for a Star Wars film. Rian Johnson is a hack.\\n\\nPros \\n-good cgi\\n\\nCons\\n-villains and heroes alike are killed off without seeing their archs all the way through\\n-noone working on this film had even a high school level of understanding in physics or science as youll watch people be completely fine after being sucked out into the vacuume of space and laser projectiles have a trajectory arch even when fired in space where theres no gravity\\n-lame new characters who are handed victories without earning them\\n-I was quoting Han the whole movie saying\\, \\\"Thats not how the force works!\\\" The Force is more of a convenient plot device to keep powering poor storytelling\\n-a single fighter ship brings down a ship that was the size of a Star Destroyer\\, if this is possible\\, WHY HASENT THE FIRST ORDER BEEN ERRADICATED!?!?!  \\n\\nJust an aweful movie that should be retconned out of existence for the good of the franchise!","true":true}
