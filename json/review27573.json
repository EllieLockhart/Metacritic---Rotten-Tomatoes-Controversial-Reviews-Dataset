Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, this movie has very little to no flaws. Rian Johnson brings a perfect balance of humor\\, action\\, and emotion that is overshadowed by this film's darker tone. Johnson doesn't just make The Last Jedi a pure Star Wars movie\\, he makes it his own creating an epic sense that is beyond anything we have seen in Star Wars. From beginning to end\\, The Last Jedi takes what we love from each of the previous trilogies and surpasses them by creating an emotional story of family\\, friendship\\, and darkness that makes it the best Star Wars movie of all time by not only satisfying fans of the old generations' stories but by making this generation have their own.\\n To check out more of my review on The Last Jedi check out my blog at: mtmovieblog.wixsite.com\/mtmovieblog","true":true}
