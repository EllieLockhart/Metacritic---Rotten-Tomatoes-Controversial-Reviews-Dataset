Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing will ever surpass episodes 4-6\\, but to be honest\\, this is the best star wars movie out of 1\\, 2\\, 3\\, And 7. Episode 8 does a great job at bringing back what made star wars unique. It\u0092s ability to use several different side stories and in the end combine them all into one epic ending\\, but\\, not really the ending(;. I really liked it\\, the characters did well\\, and the ending was great\\, and even though it wasn\u0092t what I expected\\, when has star wars ever met our expectations? Right\\, it exceeds them\\, and so did this one. It definitely helps to get episode 7 out of my mind.","true":true}
