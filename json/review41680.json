Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is memorable in the sense no other Star Wars were since the original trilogy. The lasting appeal combined with two or three scenes that blow any movie goer minds is enough to uphold what the spacial soap opera is all about. Conflict\\, redemption and blasters! I just wish the minor villains were more flashed out.","true":true}
