Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(No spoilers) This returned us to the days of eps\\, I\\, II\\, II\\, and to a lesser extent VI. It was a toy and video game ad thinly veiled behind a poorly written plot. I have no idea how writer\/director Rian Johnson got the job with three (adequate at best) movies to his credit. There is no possible way he is a fan of the original series. He clearly doesn't even understand it. Either that\\, or this was ruined by boardroom idiots.\\nThe use of Force powers was completely ridiculous. \\nIt was riddled with jokes aimed at 8 year olds and idiots\\, a failing of every Lucas film after Empire. IV & V were written for adults and kids loved them. That's the formula!\\nLike Lucas' later hot garbage\\, this will make a mint riding on the name. Undeserved. Such a waste of a great opening to the trilogy and cast.","true":true}
