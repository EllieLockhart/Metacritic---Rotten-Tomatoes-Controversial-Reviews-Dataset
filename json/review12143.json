Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong fan. I suffered through the prequels. I suffered through these Disney monstrosities. I had hope it would get better. It has not. The ORIGINAL TRILOGY still has a special place in my heart\\, but his framchise is dead\\, and this movie was the last nail in the coffin for me. I am finished with Star Wars.","true":true}
