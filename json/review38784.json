Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They destroyed Luke\u0092s character. Luke\u0092s ghost fights kylo. Bad fighting choreography. A lot of nothing happened. The most powerful character(snoke) was killed by a stupid trick. Still don\u0092t know who Snoke is and he\u0092s dead by the way. The new characters suck. Purple hair lady was lame and boring. Most of the movie was a slow car chase in space. Fynns character is worthless(and it sucks cuz u like Fynn). Rey still isn\u0092t trained but now some how she\u0092s \u0093ready.\u0094 Leiah dies but not really LOL. Then she shoots Poe with some blaster gun for no reason. This movie had so much potential to be great but ended up being a giant cliff hanger. So stupid. Don\u0092t waste your time. I\u0092m done wasting mine: I\u0092m done with Star Wars. What a joke.","true":true}
