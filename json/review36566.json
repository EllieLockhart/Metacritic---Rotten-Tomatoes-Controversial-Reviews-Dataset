Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had some cool visuals but overall it ruined so much of the franchise with stuff that made no sense. the plot holes still bother me on a daily basis - if destroying an enemy ship just took jumping to light speed to destroy it then why are there even any Star Wars movies and why even waste time building giant ships\\, how did Rey learn to fight with a lightsaber without practice\\, everything about Holdo\\, Finns\\, and Rose's entire plot\\, the complete waste of a character Snoke was\\, etc.......It's like whoever wrote the script didn't see the previous movie or have any idea what Star Wars was.","true":true}
