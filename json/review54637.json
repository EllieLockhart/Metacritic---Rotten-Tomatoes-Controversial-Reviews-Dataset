Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never expected to write a review about any movie\\, but I felt compelled to. The Last Jedi is one of the worst movies I've seen\\, and definitely the worst Star Wars film ever made.\\n\\nThis movie is a disservice to the original trilogy and is worse than the prequels. Bland characters and plot\\, no reveals for any \\\"mystery boxes\\\" that JJ Abrams left behind in ep7. Good start\\, pathetic middle\\, unsatisfying and confusing end.\\n\\nI went in with rock bottom expectations and this movie only slightly elevated my interest. The action scenes were nice\\, but they can't salvage this train wreck.\\n\\nDo not be deceived by critic reviews. They must have been paid off\\, or are too afraid of Disney to give their honest opinion.\\n\\nStar Wars feels truly dead to me\\, and may it rest in peace.","true":true}
