Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrendous \\\"progressive \\\" muddled drivel. The over politicization and leftist whitewashing of a beloved franchise. Virtue signaling of the highest magnitude. No one minds a strong female lead\\, no one cares that there is a diverse cast. Kudos. Yet when it's the thinnest veneer for sneering in the face of men (white or otherwise) or enacting some fantasy \\\"RESISTANCE\\\" revenge porn on whatever perceived or real injustices have occurred on this earth it becomes an excuse to be just as pigheaded as any past pigheadedness it seeks to expose. Whatever else this movie does offer I can tell you that it is not clever\\, nor smart. Not nuanced or complex. It is\\, however\\, clumsy\\, if not hackneyed as written and really not that much fun. Looks great though.  What a shame.","true":true}
