Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all the flaws and controversy in mind\\, my personal biggest annoyance of overusing the Jedi theme and robbing it of its impact\\, and while not liking it as much as the first\\, I still can't help but rate this a great film. There's brilliant acting from young blood\\, some bold twists\\, heart.\\n\\nIt feels flawed not because of big budget franchise mistakes such as pandering\\, but because it was too ambitious for its own good. I had a damn fine time and\\, without forgiving those mistakes\\, I like where they are\\, in my opinion\\, coming from.","true":true}
