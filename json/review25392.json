Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Non existent plot\\, rubbish answers to all our questions\\, and spent half the movie in space on a boring space chase. Every character had a bad decision made on their sub plot. Oh and blow away all the rich lore around Jedi's and just modernise it yolo\\, we don't need no training to be a Jedi now a days. OH and fight scenes\\, what fight scenes\\, can't remember any\\, they were that bad.","true":true}
