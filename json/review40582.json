Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars installment. No one in the accomplishes anything. It definitely lacks in story\\, pacing and theme. It basically killed the franchise. Johnson does like Whodoneits and so he murdered Star Wars. I do not recommend this movie.","true":true}
