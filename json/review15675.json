Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie as a die hard fan who has watched the originals from a baby with her Dad. Even my husband was blown away and he is not a fan of nerdy\\, sci-fi\\, space operas- whatever you want to call a Star Wars film. There was so much love and attention to detail and they took a huge risk- which paid off! I cannot wait to see this again! It was not a perfect film\\, but I wonder what could be perfect for all fans. Clearly there is a huge disconnect there with the swarm of bad ones. All I know is that myself\\, my friends and my dad loved it. Amazing job Rian and the whole cast and crew!","true":true}
