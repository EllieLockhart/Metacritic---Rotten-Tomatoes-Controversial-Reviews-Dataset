Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi continues the adventures of Rey\\, Finn and Kylo Ren\\, the characters set up in The Force Awakens. It is a wonderful middle chapter that was entertaining from start to finish and introduced us to an expanded vision of what the Force actually is. I\u2019m looking forward to the conclusion of this current saga and am interested in what (Director) Rian Johnson has in store for the next trilogy.","true":true}
