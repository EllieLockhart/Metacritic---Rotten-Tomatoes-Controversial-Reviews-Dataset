Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately not what we hoped for. Disney has ruined the magic of Star Wars. Too much focus on setting up future movies and no plot\/substance in this one. For fans it's worth a rental\\, but not much more.","true":true}
