Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS I enjoyed the movie be because it's star wars. It's fine if they want to tell New stories and split it in a new direction from the originals. however make a better plot. Fuel shortage in star wars. that's the most ignorant plot story ever. If you are going to kill off Luke then at least raise the xwing out of the water and get to the final battle and give yourself up that way. not by force projection. dumb and lazy writing. oh and no lightsaber battle? what??? Come on\\, it really is okay to follow the other movies with this one. Finn and rose were wasted with a side adventure. 2.5 stars and that's it. ","true":true}
