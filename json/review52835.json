Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of plot holes. Luke seems totally out of his character that we have gotten to know over the series. Plus the Director seemed to go out of his way to thumb his nose at true fans who came in expecting to finally have the questions from the last one answered. They where\\, but they went against what was expected. All in all it was a very ok movie. Just kind of had an empty feeling afterward than i have ever had after any Star Wars movie. It could just be me\\, but i kind of expected more. There is nothing really new or interesting in this film. Most of the side characters created in The Force Awakens where destroyed.","true":true}
