Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie get One star for the one Kylo and Rey fight scene I like. The rest is Garbage.\\n- 1. What they did with Luke is unforgivable.\\n- 2. Need Rey to train and not just be powerfull. That was a fail.\\n- 3. Haldo is ridiculous. That should have been Ackbar.\\n- 4. Leah Popins. Really Rian ? Really.\\n- 5. Canto Byte = Delete\\n- 6. Tico Foiled Finn's Heroic Sacrifice. WTF?!?! Ridiculous.\\nI could go on but I wont. Good bye Star Wars.","true":true}
