Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fun movie\\, but a poorly written one. All of the new series characters are terrible\\, particularly Rose\\, Finn\\, and Poe. This movie would have been much better off without Rose - she is a terrible actress and her character feels completely forced into the movie. Finn has very little to contribute as well - he is a boring character whose kooky comedic quibs are downright annoying. The writers need to kill off some of the new characters - that would keep get the audience on its toes. The writers also need to think things through further\\, INCOMING SPOILER\\, such as how did Poe in the beginning of the film manage to take out all of the enemy's ship's turrets so easily?! Think about it -- that ship is supposed to be the most powerful in the galaxy and the entirety of its anti-aircraft defenses\\, a handful of turrets\\, are able to be taken down by a single x-wing. It's not only ridiculous - it's not thought out. That's the problem with this whole movie - it was not thought out. The writers had a deadline and they forced a story out in order to meet it.","true":true}
