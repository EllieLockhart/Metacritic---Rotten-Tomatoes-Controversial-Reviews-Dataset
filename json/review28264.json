Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor old time fans! If you are one of those sad prople that felt like the prequals raped you childhood\\, then you must probably feel that with this film Disney and Rian Johnson has pretty much gang-raped the rest of your life as well. The prequals at least did not touch our old heroes in an adverse way. The Last Jedi does nothing less then cannibalise them. Especially Luke Skywalker who is sent in a direction that makes the actions and resolve of the original trilogy seem pointless. I am so sorry. This was really bad. Almost to the point of mild deppression. At least in me\\, a Star Wars fan since the late 70's.","true":true}
