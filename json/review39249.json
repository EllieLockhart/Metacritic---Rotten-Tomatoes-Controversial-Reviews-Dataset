Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had every potential and advantage on its side\\, and just simply failed. It failed as both a Star Wars film\\, and a film in general. From the off screen deaths of some of the franchises oldest characters\\, to whatever the hell that was they did with Leia. But even beyond that it failed as a film in general with storylines that go no where\\, new characters that felt forced and we didn't care about\\, and simple continuity errors that had characters seem to teleport from one location to another with zero explanation how they got out of their hazardous surroundings. In my eyes this is the biggest let down yet for the franchise. RIP Carrie\\, we love you and you deserved so much better.","true":true}
