Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see with my daughter after having to drag her along then having to explain the terrible story to her without really being able to convince myself it was cool either.Really wondering who this new addition is for since everyone in the theater young and old were shaking our heads while leaving? Glad some people seemed to like it\\, but man that was a swing and a miss! Really heartbreaking when you want your kids to enjoy Star Wars as much as you did and they're presented with that nonsense. Two stars for John Williams though.","true":true}
