Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So apparently half stars don't count so I came back to edit my review and give it 1 star.\\n\\nI went to watch this movie with my brother and mom all excited. So coming \\nout of the cinema I asked them \\\"Did you understand anything?\\\". It is not that I didn't get what was going on in the movie but was in shock how bad it was. I couldn't believe what I'd watched. My mom said \\\"It was so boring that in the last 30 minutes I was thinking about the chicken I can eat when we finally get home\\\". At least the chicken was good so there is that.\\n\\nThe jokes were not funny and ruined serious scenes. I want good directors and writers not KK and her lapdogs! The utter disrespect towards Lucas and his characters is blood boiling.\\nAs a woman\\, I am angry. You write shitty women characters and you want me\/us to feel represented and oh so thankful because they are in powerful positions. Shove it up your you know where. These are not powerful women! They are hateful\\, overpowered and non deserving of their positions! I would only watch episode IX for Kylo. The ONLY character I can relate to and feel sympathy for. Hands down the best part of this hot piling shit of a movie. I could talk about what I hate about it all day but ain't nobody got time for that. \\n\\nEveryone who loves Star Wars\\, don't give your money to disney until they get themselves together.","true":true}
