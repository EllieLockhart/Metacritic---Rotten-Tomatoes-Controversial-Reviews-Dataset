Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why some fans are completely upset with the direction Star Wars is going. After reading many Star Wars Canon\\, I was kinda upset with how Han Solo died in Force Awakens. I know I'll be watching this another 2 or 3 times. I'm just glad there's no bad acting from a young Anakin Skywalker. Maybe they'll bring back Darth Jar Jar Binks. ","true":true}
