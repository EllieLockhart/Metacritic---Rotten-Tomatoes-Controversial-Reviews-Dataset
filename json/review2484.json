Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very weak story. \\nThe chief villain was reduced to paper in a short scene and the legend of the franchise Luke became a shadow of his former self.  The plot did not benefit from these \\\"twists. It just ruined the build up from the force awakens and made the movie less entertaining. What's a sci fi story without a proper hero and villain. \\n\\nRey is unrealistic and feels more like femenist propaganda than a female protagonist. Kylo Ren has no depth ot impact \\,he is neither good nor evil\\, just stagnating in between.\\nThe side cast is occasionally entertaining but far to much time was wasted on their futile endeavours.  Overall this a very weak story and a disgrace to such a beloved franchise.","true":true}
