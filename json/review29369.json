Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson crafts a masterpiece that completely subverts everything you thought you knew about Star Wars. I consider myself a die hard and was pleasantly surprised with the direction he has taken the franchise. I'm sure his vision will be very divisive amongst us hardcore fans but place me in the camp of enthusiastically awaiting the final installment of this sequel trilogy.","true":true}
