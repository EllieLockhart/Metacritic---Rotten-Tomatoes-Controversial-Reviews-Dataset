{"101487":121462,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First up i am not a spam bot sent from Reddit or whatever\\, i'm a real boy i swear! Created an account to voice my concerns about The Last Jedi\\, the critics didn't seem to watch the same movie i did.\\n\\nThe Rotten tomatoes summation: \\n\\\"Critics Consensus: Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\"\\n\\nComplete BS and totally WRONG and here's why:\\n\\nObviously written and directed by a non star wars fan\\, instructed by his evil overlords to throw out the old and usher in the new ASAP. Just like Daisy Ridley's ass in hobo desert junker pants\\, the movie looks fantastic. However\\, once you look past the pretty explosions and the awesome sets you start to see obnoxiously strong themes appearing that have no place in your Star Wars experience. \\n\\nThemes like every female was at the front of the justice and hero brigade waving their flags arrogantly and proudly at the expense of every one of their male counterparts AND common sense also. All these pushes where not done in the \\\"wow amazing female hero\\, bravo!\\\" way but in the ultra-cringy \\\"WTF were they even thinking\\\" sort of way. Example: Laura Dern's character caused a mutiny all because she was too much of a stuck up cunt to spend the 20 seconds it would take to explain the plan to Po Dameron. Her reason for not explaining is because in her mind Po Dameron is Maveric from Top Gun. I know he's a bad ass\\, you know he's a bad ass but she thinks he's awaste of breathe? Pa-lease! Do you think she knows she's in the Rebel Alliance which kind of\\, you know; revolves around bad ass pilots? DUHHHHHH The only way he could have been more of an asset is if the DANGER ZONE played on casset tape while he took on all the bad guys by himself while she was in the shower for 3 hours dying her hair pink.\\n\\nI cant help but feel PETA had a meddling hand in this movies too. The stupid giant race-dog\/horse things where cute and all but all I could think of is if I were chinese\\, let alone an alien species I would have smashed one for lunch\\, not wasted precious mission time (and potential loss of friends lives) rescuing them. As a matter of a fact : fuck them! And fuck that little future jedi kids too! Clean the fucking stable you spoiled little future cuck lord!\\n\\nSpeaking of shitty cunts\\,The acting in this movie is incredible\\, Adam Driver has made his character truly 3 dimensional instead of the 1-D sooky mong Kilo Ren could have easily been. Some of the scenes with him and General Hux are seriously fun to watch as the pair almost come across as bickering siblings. Laura Dern's character was pretty fucking annoying\\, ergo top acting I guess because I loved her in Jurassic Park. Bennicio Deltoro has an aura of \\\"is he going to murder me in my sleep?\\\" while playing a genius traitor hobo in a pointlessly horrific plotline that went on for an hour too long. A plot line that may I mention could have been avoided in the aforementioned 20 second plan sharing. \\n\\nThe premise of the whole movie is the Rebel Alliance fleet is being chased by the New Orders fleet\\, but the Rebel fleet is running out of fuel! Gosh i hope there is a BP around the corner soon! Did they forget in space you dont need fuel due to perpetual motion?! \\n\\nThere was a relentless barage of jokes but Who were these jokes aimed at exactly? I'd say i didnt laugh at a good 90% of the jokes\\, nor did many people in the near packed audience ranging from oldies to little kids. I laughed out loud when Leia did her superman thing but i dont think that was meant to be funny. Don't believe the hype either\\, Leai didnt look like Mary Poppins during that scene\\, that far too generous of an analogy. I found it reminded me far more of Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat 1\\, you know; back when they had about 20 cells of animation.\\n\\nRay is gods gift to a lightsaber and the force with no real reason\\, no real training and especially no real parents\\, but because she is a very attractive white girl and definitely subconciously being promoted as the newest addition to the Disney Princess collection I guess she gets a free pass at criticism... this time. Speaking of which; everybody seems to be banging on about how pointless the whole sub plot where Finn and the asian girl go to the gambling planet to find the codebreaker... i bet you 20 dollerydoos that the honchos at Disney threw the asian girl in the mix to cockblock Finn's attempt at getting with Ray. In the Force awakens it was heavily implied that the black momba was definately at half mast whenever Ray was around Finn. Jungle fever is just not the type of musical Disney is ready to payroll just yet if you know what i mean.\\n\\nI could go on forever but all the movies plot holes\\, stupid plot lines\\, pointless characters\\, social justice warrior interference pales into insignificance when you see how Luke Skywalker was treated\\, Disney honchos must have got absolutely smashed off their faces on cocaine and had one massive bukkaki party all over poor Mark Hammil at every one of their boardroom meetings. The poor guy must be torn inside out and still smells like puke to this day. \\n\\nTruly criminal ...this is the biggest waste of talent AND fictional character in cinema history. Not even exaggerating. Mark Hamill was AMAZINGLY good as Luke as usual. We all waited 30 years for the baddest Jedi to ever live and they turned him into whiney old snivelling sooky lala who cares about nothing\\, has learned nothing\\, teaches nothing\\, doesn't even touch the controls of his x-wing or wield his lightsabre like the true legend he is. He has no interest in Daisy Ridley's Ray character (apparently a naturally skilled nobody even more powerful in the force than Luke) and just wants to be left alone... then why the fuck did he make a secret map to find him then? You know; 90% of what the last movie was about?? So instead we have a movie where our childhood hero was treated like utter trash. The finale sees him used a force projection \/ hologram trick to buy the last of the remaining good guys maybe an 2-3 extra minutes to escape. He does this by shows up and walking out to face down several AT-AT's. They all aim at him and they blast him like there is no tomorrow. As the dust settles we see him completely unharmed and he brushes the dust from his shoulder LIKE A COMPLETE TOSSER. Kilo Ren comes down and they begin to duel but he quickly discovers he's not even really there. The feeling of deflation as we all find out he was not really there is unfathomable. Just as blood started rushing to my boner for the first time in the entire movie you Lauraina Bobbet me hard and chopped my cock right off. Then Luke has a minor coronary from too many haemorrhoids from sitting on cold rocks for 30 years then dies. Sweet. Yep. Sweetah. Waited 30 years to see that so thank you Rian.\\n\\nYes i freely admit when Luke vanished into the force while looking into twin setting suns was cool as fuck but jesus it was about 4 movies too soon for me personally.\\n\\nIt really feels like JJ Abrams made a beautiful Star Wars sand castle on the beach where everyone is getting along and having a great time in the sun then Kathleen Kennedy come along with a gaggle of Twilight loving tweens with Rian Johnson in tow. Always eager to impress\\, Rian knocks down the castle\\, pulls his pants down and squats to Shit and piss on it (yes\\, he is a squatter). \\n\\nAfter sloppily deficating onto it\\, Rian then remoulds it into a few mounds with some shells stuck to the poop on it. Kathleen giggles joyously as Rian declares to all his new castle is amazing and original! \\n\\nA single tear rolls down JJ's cheek as everybody pulls knives from their budgie smugglers and takes aim at eachother. Its a knife fight on the beach!! \\n\\nBecause: \\n\\n1)Hey your ruined it you asshat! There was a perfect movie that was already set up for you\\, instead you made a Star Wars shaped coffin! \\n\\nor \\n\\n2)Meh; Star Wars\\, Star Trek Whatevs brah; its the change we needed.\\n\\nSo at the end of the movie i had to switch off my brain\\, my heart\\, my memory\\, my sense of humour and my cock... What did i have left to enjoy this with? FUCKING NOTHING MAN. \\n\\nWhat side of the line in the sand are you on? I dont know about you but im standing behind JJ as he wonders how in the fuck he's going to rescue this train wreck. I'm voting with my wallet and am sorry to say that i wont be taking my family to any more Star Wars movies.","true":true}
