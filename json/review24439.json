Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most boring Star Wars movie to date. Characters has no real progression. It tears down without setting anything up. Badly timed unfunny jokes. Canon breaking. It leaves you with no memorable scenes  besides the confusing\\, disappointing and infuriating ones. It has no payoff and builds nothing nor leaves any cliffhangers for the next installment.","true":true}
