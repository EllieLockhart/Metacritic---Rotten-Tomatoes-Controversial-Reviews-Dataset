Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"My opinion regarding killing Joel at the beginning of the game I think it was well introduced so that it could involve both Ellie's revenge and \\\"Abby's\\\" revenge that in the end wants to seek redemption while Ellie is still consumed by anger\\, fear \\, guilt and sadness for what happened to Joel\\, and it was very impactful\\, which may have caused many people to have many feelings or not\\, and regardless of that I know that there are or had many comments cursing and giving low marks because Ellie is a lesbian that it is very sad because there are still people who play the game because of the sexual option of the character and what is shown inside the game as part of LGBT people this for me has no difference is normal remembering that the game is for people over 18 so it does not come with papinho ai pq implement sexuality in the game first the director does whatever he wants with his work and second is a well told story it treats Joel's actions and what he did for all this to happen the fact is the first game was for more 16 ores so there are a lot of dizzy adults with bad and homophobic talk more returning to the subject of the game\\, the improved gameplay was very good I thought it makes you want to play about it\\, the graphics are wonderful\\, the characters some could have put more history in them\\, nothing more to worry about until they are well involved\\, there could be more ester eggs more and I like it I\u2019m fissured in ester egg sorry\\, the expressions are wonderful\\, jaw dropping in Portuguese is too much I\u2019m Brazilian and the language of America was also amazing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
