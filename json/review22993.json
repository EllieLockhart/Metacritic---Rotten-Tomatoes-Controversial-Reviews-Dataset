Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of great special effects and moments\\, but the story was disjointed and provided little expansion on the threads left hanging from 'Force Awakens.' It's best not to know anything about Star Wars if you're going to watch this and enjoy it.","true":true}
