Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just don't care about Star Wars anymore.  The franchise really has failed to give any truly fresh perspectives.  It always has been about the Struggle between good and bad\\, the dark and the light.  I understood that after the first few movies.  They continue to fail at developing an interesting and complete mythos of the force.  If this how the francise will continue...this one should have been titled: Star Wars: The Last Movie.","true":true}
