Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a fan of how the Star Wars lore was treated and the portrayal of Luke Skywalker. A lot of issues such as Rose storyline line and the chase with Admiral Holdo.","true":true}
