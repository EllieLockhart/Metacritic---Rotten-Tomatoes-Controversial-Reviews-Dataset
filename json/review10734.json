Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half a star is still far too many! This movie from it's visuals to its writting is shit\\, Terrible story! Terrible preformance! Terrible character develoupment! No arcs! And worst of all\\, No soul! Can't even call this a proper Star Wars movie\\, that's how bad it is. This is how you kill a billion-dollar franchise off like a dinosaur\\, Disney shoudn't have bought Lucasfilm\\, PERIOD!! The movie would have been way better\\, even better than the modern Star Wars films","true":true}
