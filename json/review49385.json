Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars yet\\, comedy was forced\\, too long\\, snoke died too easily and I feel as the movie went no where. I felt like mark hamill was being too much like him self( due to directors fault) and not luke skywalker. I did agree with Rey's background however.","true":true}
