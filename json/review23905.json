Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"makes me sad of what star war is turning into. The story didn't make sense in so many aspects. Some scenes didn't even need to be in the movie. some characters fates were horrible in what became of them in this film and there are too many useless characters as well being forced down our throats. overall this didn't feel like a real star wars to me at all..
