Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars for visual effects only. The story is garbage. Plot holes\\, character actions that make no sense\\, little or no backstory revealed\\, some of the most outrageously stupid things I've ever seen even for sci-fi\\, no explanations given for where or how some of the characters came to be in the story. Horrible writing\\, terrible movie. Disney should remove the film from theaters immediately\\, reshoot it entirely with a better written story\\, apologize for this giant piece of crap and give free tickets to new version for anyone that paid to see this one. DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE A TRUE STAR WARS FAN. You will be disappointed. You have been warned!","true":true}
