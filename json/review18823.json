{"101487":142308,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's amazing to see people giving Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 5 stars rating.  It's actually quite laughable.  The Shawshank Redemption is a 5 star movie.  Good Will Hunting is a 5 star movie.  A Beautiful Mind is a 5 star movie.  There are several other films that have well-earned that coveted 5 star perfect rating\\, but TLJ is not one of those films.  Not by a long shot.  TLJ is nowhere near the quality of the films mentioned above.  Most people giving TLJ a high review are not even sharing their thoughts as to why they feel TLJ deserves a perfect score.  That's disgraceful and looks suspicious.  This is how plenty of those 5 star reviews go also. \\\"Even though I don't consider TLJ to be a perfect film....5 stars.\\\"  Although there are flaws in the movie....5 stars.\\\"  Like I said before\\, laughable!  On the other side of the coin\\, there are scores of people laying down several examples and reasons why they didn't like and\/or enjoy this film.  I'm proud to be in this camp.\\nI watched TLJ twice.  After my first viewing\\, I left the theater feeling unsatisfied.  After the second viewing\\, I left the theater feeling disgusted.  There are so many great negative reviews pointing out all the flaws in the film which\\, I for the most part agree with\\, but I wanted to touch upon how horrible the movie ended.  Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   \\nSo the film ends with a feeling of hope.  Rey has everything she needs because Yoda says so.  Rey doesn't need any Jedi combat and force training\\, because she has a few ancient Jedi texts to read through.  I tried this type of training once in my life.  When I was sixteen\\, I bought and read through Bruce Lee's\\, Tao of Jeet Kune Do\\, hoping to become of great fighter on my own.  I trained a little on my own like Rey did in the film.  Twenty five years later\\, I'm still waiting for the book reading to pay off.  This is essentially what's being proposed in The Last Jedi.  This is absolute nonsense.   After all\\, Abrams did start off this Mary Sueness in Rey\\, so I suppose it's only fitting that Abrams has to finish it.  My only question on this topic now is who is going to train Rey?  Answer: No one or a Luke force ghost which IMO are both terrible options.  Good luck Abrams.             \\nThe resistance has everything they need also because why...did I miss something?   Recap: Luke is dead; the resistance is down to 20 or so people\\, they have no capital ships or star fleet\\, no small star fighters or bombers\\, etc .  The only ship in the resistance arsenal is the Millennium Falcon.  When the resistance called for aid on Crait\\, no star systems came to help.  No one even responded to the distress call!!!  But hey\\, there's a force sensitive slave kid at the end of the movie who's going to take that broom and squash the First Order with it.  The movie tries to portray that even though the resistance got their butts kicked (except Rey of course) that the resistance will come back stronger than ever.  How?   The way the story was written\\, there is no possible way for the resistance to come back from this butt kicking.  If the solution is to write that all these star systems want to help now in IX you better give one hell of an explanation as to why they changed their minds.  As far as I'm concerned\\, hope is dead for the resistance and the Star Wars franchise\\, especially with the way Kathleen Kennedy is running things at Lucas Film.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy left a massive mess for Abrams to clean up in IX. \\nThe Force is human\\, it is not female only.   The force connects all of humanity\\, female\\, male\\, black\\, white\\, Christian\\, Muslim\\, Atheist\\, Democrat\\, Republican\\, young\\, old\\, jocks\\, nerds\\, you name it...it unifies.  Mr. George Lucas\\, thank you for bringing Star Wars into this world.  Your Star Wars truly unified.","true":true}
