Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi will be the last Star Wars film I watch.\\n\\nIf you grew up with the original trilogy and the characters still hold a place in your heart I strongly recommend you do not watch this movie.\\n\\nI left the cinema feeling old\\, tired and very sad. To be brutally honest I was emotionally crushed by this movie and it's just not what I was expecting nor what I wanted at Christmas time from Star Wars. I'm a left-wing activist in the UK so don't think I'm hating on it because of its progressive values - that was all fine. It's the (mis)treatment of the old characters that ruined my evening.","true":true}
