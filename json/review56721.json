Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie honestly leaves you bewildered after the first billing. You are in awe because it is star wars\\, but also confused because it doesn't exactly read as starwars either. After multiple viewings\\, the negatives really weigh down the positives. The movie has a strong issue with pacing\\, character development and also the addition of unnecessary scenes and sub plots that don't really add to the main conflict of the story.  Along with this there is a saturation of characters that do not fit the established star wars aesthetic\\, and seem to be there for the sake of representation and even politics outside of the franchise. Sadly the established characters also suffer\\, and instead feel like new characters who are only related to their former iterations by name\\, ie Luke. A heroic character like Luke still could of have been portrayed as someone despaired by tragedies and wants to break from old traditions\\, but the execution was poorly done. Lastly\\, the film feels like an end to a series instead of a middle film to a trilogy. And besides that\\, there isn't a strong continuation between 7 and 8 like their predecessors in the saga. The movie is still a beautiful example of cinematography in an artistic form stronger than previous films. Also if you focus generally on Rey and Kylo's tension\\, especially when confronted by Snoke\\, you will be captivated especially when considering the poetry of the past films that led up to their characters. Hoping for the best with the concluding film to this trilogy to bring back what made Star War really captivating.","true":true}
