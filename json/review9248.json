Yet he can't pull the trigger. \\n nothing went right with Leia.\\nI always thought the whole map to find luke was stupid. \\nThis verified it. \\nBB8 became the most powerful  jedi. \\n13 year old pilot \\\"bombs away\\\" was pathetic\\nDIALOGUE IS THE MOST PATHETIC PART OF THIS MOVIE","true":true}
