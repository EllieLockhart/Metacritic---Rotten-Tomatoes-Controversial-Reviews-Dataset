Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this one is much closer to IV in terms of the characters' dialogues and humorous elements. I cannot give the original cast less than 5 stars anyway\\, and the newbies were good studies of the ethos. Of all the the new cast for VIII\\, I found Gleeson's Hux character the most compelling. Whilst I understand the issues raised by the 'decanonising' petitioners have merit\\, it's still viewers' tastes and preferences\\, rather akin to Martin Luther's contempt for St James' Epistle. There's a higher Force at work behind the scenes.","true":true}
