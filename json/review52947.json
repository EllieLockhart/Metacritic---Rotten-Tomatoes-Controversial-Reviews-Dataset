Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone surprised at the contrast in critic and user reviews shouldn't be. Look at what Disney has offered up for 21st Century Fox. Haha I think Disney is actually owned by Russia..maybe. Lost respect for Rian Johnson..held Looper in a high regard as well as well..Star Wars of course. Disappointing. This Social agenda\\, that is the \\\"flavour of today\\\" has no business in a Star Wars movie...clearly this sentiment is shared collectively.","true":true}
