Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All spoillers below;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- The credits were painfully dismissive; Force Awakens had the newly formed republic dealling with remnants of this fallen empire\\, The Starkiller Base seemingly crippled the republic so badly they could no longer maintain power and one line in the scrolling intro wiped it's existance clean\\, a throw away line that \\\"The First Order now reign\\\"\\, baffling how the entire resurgence of evil in the galaxy was an off-screen event.\\n\\n- This film demonstrates that Star Wars is becoming a 'whacky' series with every scene packed with shit jokes and 'funny' monsters\\, this all feels cringey and forced at best.\\n    While the Original Trilogy and Prequels had some stupid monsters and jokes\\,the quantity of jokes and gags has become massive\\, it's like 90% of scenes were the setup for a joke\\, Star Wars was never a comedy but this felt like the main focus of the film was cheesey gags.\\n\\n- A great deal of these new films have been the same re-hashed storys\\, Force Awakens was A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi was a clusterfuck:\\n    Virtually every scene felt like a cheap knock-off from previous films with the first scene of a ship being chased down by a Star Destroyer\\, a casino resembling The Cantina\\, a final base representing Hoth\\, intentional or not it feels lazy to reuse old scenarios.\\n\tEven characters resemble those previously seen: \\n\t    Captain Phasma was in these films to represent a Boba-esque figure but she fell short\\, her actions were trivial and death; meaningless.\\n\t\tSnoke was a one dimensional bad guy\\, he was in these films to fill in for The Emperor and guide Anakin to the darkside\\, atleast the scene after his death was interesting scene between Ben and Rey.\\n\tI'm fully aware that they may want to appease fans by using a story they already enjoy but it lacks originality; The Prequels\\, despite the storyline being a convoluted mess\\, was a massive departure from the Original Trilogy and shows these new films up as samey\\, they don't take risks they present existing stories back to you.\\n\\n- Especiallly cringey scenes:\\n    BB-8 hijacking a AT-ST was such an intensely stupid scene I wanted to walk out of the cinema.\\n    Leia pulling herself to safety was possibly the most cringe-inducing moment in cinematic history; violently ripped out of the bridge into space but remains both alive and consious to the point that she can casually zip back to the ship\\, this would have been a great scenario to remove Leia from the story but she's saved\\, out of nowhere by her natural force sensitivity.\\n\\n- Overall I thought this film was dull\\, lacked a consistent plotline and felt cheap; every scene was a 'whacky' joke waiting to happen and almost every character was one dimensional.","true":true}
