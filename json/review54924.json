Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a perfect movie. There are some flaws here and there\\, but overall\\, I thinking this is one of\\, If not the best Star Wars movie in recent memory. Just set aside all your assumptions am different expectations about what you're going to see. Like Luke says in the trailer\\, \\\"this isn't  going to go then way you think.\\\"","true":true}
