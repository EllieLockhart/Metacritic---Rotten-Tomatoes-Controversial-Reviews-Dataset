Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like I was watching bad fan fiction. The plot was kind of absurd and the characters dull and predictable. Think I've finally just about had enough of Star Wars now.","true":true}
