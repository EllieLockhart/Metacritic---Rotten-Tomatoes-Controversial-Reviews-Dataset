Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Es una mierda el gui\u00f3n\\, no me podes decir que esta mierda de p\u00e1gina le da un 93 %\\, mentirosos son una basura","true":false}
