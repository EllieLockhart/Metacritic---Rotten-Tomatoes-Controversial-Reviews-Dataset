Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe this is a Star Wars movie. It felt like a parody with good visual effects... It was very anticlimactic. The plot does not make any sense and filled with many unexplained holes. It felt like a kid movie more than a sci-fi movie. This movie is a huge letdown compared to the hype and previous star wars movie but it has good visual effect... Not to mention the unnecessary political agenda and feminist view portrayed. To avoid watching.","true":true}
