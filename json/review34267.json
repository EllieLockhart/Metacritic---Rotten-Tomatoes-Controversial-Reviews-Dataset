Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 1 star is for John Williams even though he just rehashed his old themes. The half star is for the CGI. \\n\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy deserve MINUS stars! They have no respect for our intelligence as an audience.  And I have no respect for their product.","true":true}
