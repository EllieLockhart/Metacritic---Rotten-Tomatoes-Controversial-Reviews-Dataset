Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, this was an absolute joy to watch. It struck the perfect balance between paying homage to the original classics\\, while generating new ideas\\, plots\\, and concepts to continue driving the story forward. I loved the much-needed diversity and representation of strong female leaders. We laughed\\, we cried\\, and we were on the edge of our seats the entire time. It was truly unforgettable and we are already planning to see it again!","true":true}
