Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi gave me everything I could have ever wanted in a Star Wars movie and I didn't even know that I wanted it. It was a wonderfully brave\\, beautiful and heartfelt movie. I never thought that I could love Star Wars more than I already did\\, apparently I was wrong. Rian Johnson\\, May the force be with you always!!","true":true}
