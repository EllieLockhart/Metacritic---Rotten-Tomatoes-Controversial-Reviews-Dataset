The gameplay\\, though not really anything new or innovative\\, was still solid.\r\rCONS:\r1. The story and its direction.\r2. The characters and how they were portrait or lack there of.\r3. The story plot of revenge doesn't make any sense at the end.\r4. The entire setup and ending from part 1 was destroyed and disregarded in the first few hours.\r5. Everything in the trailers were a misrepresentation of the game.\r6. This game was more like a movie than a video game.\r\rOverall\\, I did not enjoy the game. The story\\, it's direction\\, its pace and the direction of its characters were not enjoyable. The creator of the game said\\, there's no \\\"fun\\\" in this. And they were right. This game is not fun to play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
