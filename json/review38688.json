Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst thing about the Star Wars movies are the FANS. They are the absolute worst!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah\\, the movie is not without its flaws\\, but the mass amount of crybabies who insist on spending their time on the internet\\, trash talking the movie\\, instead of going outside and continuing to live their lives\\, is unreal.\\nThe Last Jedi is brave enough to show us something we haven't seen before\\, and that should be acknowledged. Yeah\\, they took Luke's story in a completely different direction\\, but still\\, Luke' story line is the best thing about the movie. Mark was incredible.","true":true}
