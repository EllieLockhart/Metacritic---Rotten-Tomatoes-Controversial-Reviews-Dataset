Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable while watching it\\, but if you think about it later\\, it's terrible in so many ways. Looks great in terms of cinematography but the story is a plot hole that retroactively makes episode VII worse.","true":true}
