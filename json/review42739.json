Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great. was on the edge of my seat the whole time. People who complain about this thing are too stupid to understand what Rian Johnson was trying to do with the franchise. It's new and surprising. Every time you think it's going to go one direction it goes the opposite direction. Star Wars fans are the absolute worst. This might be the best of the franchise and it deserves more respect and a higher rating","true":true}
