Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The WORST star wars anything ever... worse than the Holiday Special. Yes... at LEAST the Holiday Special had the characters we know... STAY IN CHARACTER. Yes is sucked\\, but it didn't CHANGE the characters. TLJ ruins star wars. In spite of being MADE well technically... aside from the prop and creature department...I'll get to that\\, this movie is just terrible in execution of the story\\, humor\\, and character development. The creature\/prop department can't even get Yoda correct. You have fans able to make a perfect looking yoda\\, but the mega budget of an official production fails to get it right. Sigh...","true":true}
