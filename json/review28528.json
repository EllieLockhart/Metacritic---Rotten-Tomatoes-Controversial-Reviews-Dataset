Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably in the top 3 of most disappointing sequels of ever\\, after so much potential buildup from Force Awakens this movie felt like the writer\/director was deliberately trolling the audience with his 'surprising twists' of delivering absolutely nothing in terms of developing any of the characters from the last part. This could be excused if he replaced it with a compelling story but here again with a few exceptions most of the plot lines made no sense. The only redeeming parts of the movie were the couple scenes with Mark Hamill and parts with Rey and Kylo Ren\\, two-thirds of the movie was nearly unwatchable\\, I can not begin to comprehend how this movie has a >90% critics rating\\, I will be watching the sequel to this rubbish on Netflix cause at this point I don't trust Disney to fix this.","true":true}
