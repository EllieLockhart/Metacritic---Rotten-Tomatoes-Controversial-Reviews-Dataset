Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Uninspiring and fragmented story makes the movie feel amateur and empty.  Useless plot deviations to Canto\\, big let downs by not telling us anything fun about Rey or Snoke\\, and the ridiculous way Luke was depicted as broken and eccentric.  It is as if Rian was trying to make a pun of Star Wars canon instead of adding exciting and energizing creativity to the story.  For the first time in my life I truly am unexcited about the next movie in the Star Wars universe.  Critics should be more honest about this movie\\, it should not get anything better than a failing grade.","true":true}
