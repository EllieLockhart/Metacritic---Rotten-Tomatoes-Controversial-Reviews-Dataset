Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously so much wrong with this movie. Graphics are beautiful\\, the saber fight was very well done. Beyond that though...just ugh. The side plots were meaningless\\, Rose is pointless\\, the plot points exist only because of bad writing.\\n\\nIf you have to watch new star wars\\, rewatch Rogue 1 instead.","true":true}
