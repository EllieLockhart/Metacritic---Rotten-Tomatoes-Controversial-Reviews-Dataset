Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a huge let down. I really liked The Force Awakens. J.J set up the dominoes. He left so many open questions for the next director to play with. It's a shame Rian didn't want to play. This is one those movies that was such disrespect to fans that after episode IX I'm done. Please J.J give the Skywakers a proper send off. Sorry Disney but you lost me as a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
