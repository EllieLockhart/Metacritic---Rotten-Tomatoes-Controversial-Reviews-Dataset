Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson allowed me to forget about Jarr Jarr\\, trade federations & sand dislikes; not in a good way. Finn's storyline was pointless\\, Snoke was pointless & Luke's story arch was barely passable. At least Obi-wan went out swinging in person\\, come on. BB-8\\, I enjoyed but the main heroes have to get themselves out of trouble sometimes. The only good fight scene with lightsabers in it was way too short but good. I feel better about J.J. coming back & confused about why Disney would green light A WHOLE TRILOLOGY BY JOHNSON. I feel bad about making my friends and family loose sleep to see it last night. Shame on you R. Johnson & Disney- you're killing my childhood & taking my money at the same time.","true":true}
