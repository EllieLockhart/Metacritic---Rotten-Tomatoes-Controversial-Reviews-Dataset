Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi continues the saga to help send off the original trio from the original trilogy will such grace and flair\\, that those who have grown up with the franchise will love all the twists and turns!","true":true}
