A grimdark story can be excused in certain cases when the gameplay itself is fun but with TLOU2 the creators try to make you regret playing it. Never before have I seen a game trying so hard to make you regret spending your money on it and with the current global situation that is an idiotic philosophy for a video game. I honestly question the sanity of the execs who signed off for this game to be released. It is such a directorial self insert that it may as well be Druckmanns facebook page. From inserting a character almost certainly based on himself who spits on the corpse of the first game to adding parts with his religion and personal politics there can be no doubt that this game is Neil's fantasy or else a physical embodiment of his own arrogance. Who signed off to release this? From the original games heartwarming and brutal paean to the relationship between Fathers and their Daughters to a confused mishmash of hysterical modern political preaching and violence to the point of parody this game wants to be hated to make a point that even it isn't sure about. In places visually stunning but the animations at times leave a lot to be desired. The jump button is useless and the box declaring it as a feature in 2020 is ridiculous. To best sum up TLou2 we must compare it to the first game because it is an unashamed vendetta against everything that made the first game special. It is akin to tearing down a classic painting\\, burning it and then proclaiming yourself the true artist. I understand certain zeitgeists put deconstruction of a classic on a pedestal but this is just crude and bitter. Even the pseudo Kojima trickery attempted by the trailers was bought by nobody. The fans knew what was coming. The main point of my review is that hardly any of what is in Tlou2 needs to be in a video game. A good video game with a bad story is playable. A bad video game with a good story is acceptable. Tlou2 may have familiar controls to the first game but the game tries to guilt trip you for using them. A survival horror game that tries to guilt trip you for surviving is not worth the plastic its printed on. Do sports games penalise you for scoring? All in all the game sought to elicit a negative response and I hope it gets it because contempt for the fanbase should never be rewarded. The minute you veer towards that you fail as an industry.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
