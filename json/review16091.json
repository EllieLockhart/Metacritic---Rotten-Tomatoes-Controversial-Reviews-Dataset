Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a Star Wars fan and this movie is epic\\, fantastic\\, deep\\, suspenseful\\, rare but fun.\\n\\nThe plot is filled with gaps that will surely be answered in the other film\\, leaving us with even more suspense.\\nHe's got a lot of memorable scenes\\, lots of fun ones. I recommend it\\, do not be fooled by critics who did not see the depth of this film\\, it is a new era for Star Wars.\\n\\nThe message... or the various messages that this film brings are incredible.\\n\\nI recommend it.\\n I loved it!","true":true}
