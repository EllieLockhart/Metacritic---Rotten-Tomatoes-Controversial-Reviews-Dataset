Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This did not feel like a Star Wars movie. All the slap stick humor and pointless subplots make this movie a joke. \\nLuke's character is unrecognizable and even attempts to murder his nephew in his sleep because he may go down the dark side....really?! And he is a grumpy \\\"get off my lawn\\\" hermit that doesn't care his family\/friends are dieing\/died. What a complete overhaul of Luke's character from OT.\\nMore worthless characters with no back story and gets punked\\, See Snoke and Phasma. \\nFinn is a terrible character that seems to know everything about FO technology but he was a janitor. He flees from battle twice in TFA and once in TLJ. He is a liability to whatever side he is on. He isn't a hero but a coward. Poe makes two decisions in this film that almost kills every single Resistance member. The opening attack on the devastator and during his mutiny which sends Rose and Finn on their pointless quest. By bringing the Hacker back\\, he alerts the FO to all the transports leaving and they blow up 25 of 30. With a friend like Poe and Finn on your side\\, who needs an enemy. \\nAnd what was with that Mary Poppins scene with Leia....like wtf\\, really?\\nI don't think I will pay to go see Episode 9 and will instead wait for rental. Its a real shame\\, I've seen every movie at release too.","true":true}
