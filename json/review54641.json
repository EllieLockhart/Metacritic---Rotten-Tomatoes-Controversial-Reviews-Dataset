Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would leave a new SW movie feeling the level of disappointment that I did after seeing TLJ.  The amount of missed opportunities and just flat out wrong plot directions was just mind boggling.  And I don't mean wrong because they weren't what I wanted\\, but wrong because they didn't stay true to the underlying themes and story of SW.  What Rian Johnson\\, a self-professed fan of Luke Skywalker\\, chose to do to one of the most beloved characters in cinema history was inexcusable and will not be forgotten by myself and millions of other fans.  An insurmountable travesty in my opinion for the SW brand.  \\n\\nThere are so many things wrong with TLJ\\, and so few that it got right\\, that I won't bother to list them.  At this point there are plenty of reviews\/rants out there enumerating these flaws much better than I can here.  However\\, I will mention that aside from the bad writing and flow of the film\\, the over-the-top SJW and blatant feminism crap did nothing to improve the impression the film made on me.\\n\\nThanks Disney and Rian Johnson\\, you managed to do what I thought was impossible; in the span of a mere 2 hours and 40 minutes you stole my passion for Star Wars and replaced it with true apathy regarding what comes next.  Episode IX you ask?  Who really gives a shit at this point? \\n\\nAnd for the record\\, NO\\, I am not a \\\"bot\\\" writing this review to sully the score of the TLJ on Rotten Tomatoes.  I've never felt compelled to write anything on RT before\\, but this movie was so bad I I felt I had to do something to make my voice heard\\, regardless of what little impact it might have.","true":true}
