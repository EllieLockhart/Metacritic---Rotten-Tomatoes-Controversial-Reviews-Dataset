{"101487":184207,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolutely terrible\\, a complete murdering of the Star Wars saga.  There should be a negative stars scale. Rian Johnson took a sledgehammer to all the good will re-established by the Force Awakens.  In watching this travesty\\, I got the exact same reaction I got when I saw the Phantom Menace for the first time\\, absolute disbelief and disgust.  I can't believe that someone actually let this get made.  Was nobody paying attention?  Whoever was in charge should be ashamed.  Everything exciting that the Force Awakens alluded to was completely thrown away.  Big moment when Rey hands Luke the lightsaber\\, he tosses it over his shoulder in a Saturday Night Live comedy skit. Instead of being a Skywalker\\, Rey is just some all powerful nobody. Kylo is a spoiled brat with moobies. No info on Snoke other than he wears slippers for comfort. Knights of Ren\\, nope\\, they are MIA.  Toss in some stupid porgs\\, lizard nuns\\, Luke milking some turtle thing with teets\\, a slow speed chase through space\\, flying Leia (OMG)\\, the neutering of Poe\\, the running of the camel dogs\\, Force-time\\, Rey's snapping routine\\, a crappy\\, giggling Yoda puppet (how can you not recreate something from 1980?)\\, BB-8 driving an AT-ST\\, BB-8 shooting bad guys with coins\\, purple lady not sharing her plan like an idiot\\, Hux not calling more ships to cutoff the resistance like an idiot\\, the resitance for not sending ships in hyperspace in different locations like idiots\\, purple lady for not realizing there are such things as droids and autopilot\\, broom boy and the kids from Annie\\, a casino and aliens straight from the steaming pile that were the prequels\\, \\\"Mmm\\, this is salt\\\"\\, the romance between Rose and Finn (WTF) and there you have it.  While watching the movie\\, I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to jump out and say I was punked. Wow\\, just wow.  How does this happen? Fans waited a long time for the return of Luke Skywalker\\, Jedi Master\\, and all they got was the grumpy old troll from Dora the Explorer. The characterization of Luke was horrible\\, a complete slap in the face to Mark Hamill and Star Wars in general. I can't believe they let Rian Johnson do all of this.  It reminds me of Boomerang when Eddie Murphy let that guy do the Strange commercial unchecked.  'Last Jedi\\, it stinks so good'.  No\\, no\\, it smells like the giant turd that it is.","true":true}
