Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels like people have covered this well but it cannot be said enough... This is a very poor excuse for a Star Wars movie. It was awful from start to finish. The plot was terribly written and the characters were either disgraces or showed no development whatsoever. I'm a woman and I couldn't stand the amount of toxic feminism. Look I love a strong female character but this movie is so over the top with bringing down male characters and elevating female characters that it becomes ridiculous. Easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made.","true":true}
