Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has its good parts\\, parts make you want to sleep\\, others bother enough (Yoda being a fool\\, when Yoda is the best Jedi\\, and they showed him like a fool and I did not like that) among other things. The next Star Wars movie I will not despair in seeing it like this.","true":true}
