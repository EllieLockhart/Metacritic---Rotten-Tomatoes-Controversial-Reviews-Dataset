Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it\\, really liked it; but overall disappointed.\\nI really wish they would of used George Lucas as a consultant. And followed his original plot.  Disney you could of made so much more and keep your fan base.\\nSad really sad","true":true}
