Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers:::::::This movie is a giant middle finger pointed at The Force Awakens.  Finn and Rose could be cut from the entire movie and it wouldn't alter a single plot point.  Rey's parents reveal was the biggest FU to the Force Awakens. Snoke ending was weak.  Luke ending was weak\\, and he was just a crotchety old grumpy coward.  Hyperspace jumping a drastically smaller ship into a massive super destroyer size ship makes all space combat pointless.  Other than all that\\, I liked it :\/  \\nVisually stunning overall and Rey\/Kylo vs Praetorian guards was the only scene I can really remember that I loved (minus Snoke's death).\\nThis movie's problem is that the director doesn't seem to realize that The Last Jedi is NOT a standalone film.  It is part of a trilogy\\, and you can't completely ignore the movie that came before it.  Abram's has the chance to not just make episode 9 great\\, he can fix a lot of The Last Jedi as well (by answering everything The Last Jedi ignored).","true":true}
