Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie's story simply isn't very good. It doesn't make any sense and it's compltley disjointed. This has nothing to do with gender\\, race\\, or position of the characters. My favorite line I read from an actual critic is that \\\"every actor and actress in this movie deserved a better script.\\\" What they did Luke Skywalker was insane. Disney is currently out with a huge marketing push planting stories and getting some friendly stories but the movie just isn't good which is a shame because where they left off the last one\\, which wasn't great but pretty good\\, set them up to be able to do something great and instead they made this. It's worth watching but if you're someone who loves the original trilogy you're probably going to leave the theatre questioning a lot of the choices they made.","true":true}
