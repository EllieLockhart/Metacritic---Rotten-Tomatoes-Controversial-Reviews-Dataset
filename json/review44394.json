Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many things going on in the movie in my opinion: confusion. The transitions between the scenes is poorly connected and bad executed. You have the impression of a continue parade of special guests going on during the entire movie. It could have been better than that. It could at least have a coherent story from beginning to the end. The film could have ended much earlier. What we see in the film could have been diluted in two films with a better direction and screenplay\\, eliminating some useless and really ugly scenes. I really enjoyed the story between Kylo Ren and Rey\\, but not the ending part that actually nullifies the growth of the characters developed during the movie.","true":true}
