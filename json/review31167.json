Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many issues and flaws... dreadnought's don't have shields??  Why are bombs 'falling'?  there's not gravity in space...and why are the bombers moving at a snail's pace.... But the biggest issue with what they did with Luke.   The most iconic character of the saga and they completely disregard this character's psyche and legacy.... From the hero who faced Vader and the Emperor- and the beacon of hope for the galaxy...the eternal optimist who sees the good in everyone....to a coward hiding on an island who was going to kill his nephew in his sleep...??!?!!!??!     And to have his end be so anti-climatic....  Wow.    Where was Kathleen Kennedy and Pablo Hidalgo to keep things fluid with canon????      A slap in the face for real fans.","true":true}
