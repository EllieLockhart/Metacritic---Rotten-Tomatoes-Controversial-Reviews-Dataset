Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst star wars movie so far!  Whoever is responsible for writing this crap should be fired because they have ruined Star Wars.  Plot full of holes with whole scenes that are unnecessary and add nothing to the story.  Luke's character has been emasculated along with all the other male characters as a helpless\/hopeless old Jedi.  They could've at least made him believable in his role by being more like old Ben Kenobi.  I'm just so disappointed and sad that my childhood movie has taken this turn down the toilet.","true":true}
