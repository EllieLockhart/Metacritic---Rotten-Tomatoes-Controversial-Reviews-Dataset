Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sitting down in the theater for a new Star Wars movie is always special. The feeling is heightened by the entire room\u2019s excitement. I left the theater thinking I had enjoyed myself\\,...but that\u2019s when the high wore off. Given some thought\\, this movie has a ton of problems\\, and lots of plot holes. Fans are not really given an homage to Star Wars the way The Force Awakens did. Instead\\, they changed everything. ","true":true}
