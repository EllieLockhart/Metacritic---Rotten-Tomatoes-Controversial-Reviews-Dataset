Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"as a die hard star was fan this film was extremely disappointing. introducing the worst character in the franchise in Holdo. Ackbar should have gone down with his ship. There is no anchor for hope and too much of a political agenda behind the script and characters. This should be a family film and Disney have really done the dirty on the franchise. Make star wars for the fans not the Oscars.","true":true}
