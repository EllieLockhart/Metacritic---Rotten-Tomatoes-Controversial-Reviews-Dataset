Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very different tone from the other\\, recent Star Wars films\\, The Last Jedi is a disappointing example of a Star Wars film attempting to be something it is not.  Strange wannabe-Guardians-of-the Galaxy\/Marvel humor mixed in with tacky\\, unnecessary\\, and some outright dumb plot choices make this a film that appears to be pandering to a very basic and simple audience (when\\, in fact\\, most movie-goers are not so basic and simple) at the sacrifice of making a good movie.","true":true}
