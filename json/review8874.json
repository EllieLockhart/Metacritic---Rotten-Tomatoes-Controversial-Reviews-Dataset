Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the love of all that is holy... please\\, kick the writers of this tragic excuse of a movie out of the business!  I swear\\, if we don't get some serious spaceship battles and real light saber duals soon\\, criminal charges may be levied. \\n\\nSo I get it\\, Star Wars fans \\\"must\\\" go to see this movie (guilty). But its just so disappointing to be faced with yet another snooze fest with no plot\\, shallow characters and no action. The triple crown of failure.  Fortunately\\, the theater we saw it in had just been redone with full reclining seats!!! Even better\\, the wife came and was there to wake me up when it was over!","true":true}
