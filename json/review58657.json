My respect to Neil Druckmann who has crafted a complex and intricate narrative within a medium that he changed 7 years ago with the first game. The central theme of the game is the endless cycle of violence. A disease that we humans have been victims of for thousands of years. If the first game is about love and care for one another\\, this one is about revenge and the terrible consequences that it brings. I have seen a lot of biased opinions towards the story and I say biased because of the people who criticized the leaks instead of playing the actual game. The game is constructed from the perspective of two central characters Ellie and Abby\\, (yes\\, not Joel\\, get over it) two sides of the same coin\\, through which we can see the horror of the post-outbreak world. I'm not trying to convince people who disliked it that this is a masterpiece for the ages. It's pointless arguing and it says a lot about you if you are unable to understand what the game is trying to tell you. I am writing this to show appreciation towards Neil Druckmann and the Naughty Dog Team who deserve it and have given us so much. And all I want to say to you Neil is: From the bottom of my heart\\, THANK YOU. I'll be forever changed by this experience and I hope that someday I can create just a bit of what you have done with these two games.\r\r\\\"When you are Real you don't mind being hurt\\\".\u2026 Expand","true":true}
