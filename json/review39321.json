Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is amazing and it keeps the spirt of Star Wars alive. For me these films have always been a fun experience outside of the real world and I could never understand why so many have to divide these films and take away the spark they hold in cinema history. I fully understand that the original three will stand the test of time but you have to adapt with the times and appreciate these new films for what they are. The Last Jedi was an amazing Star Wars film it had so much raw energy and it left you wanting more. I don't want to go into the film to much because of spoilers but if you appreciate Star Wars go out and see this film I personally loved it just like every other Star Wars film. May the force be with you... always","true":true}
