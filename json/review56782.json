Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason this film isn't getting a rock bottom rating from me is the aesthetics. \\n\\nEverything else about the film was cheap and insulting to watch. I felt like I was being presented an up jumped puppet show. \\n\\nThe idea behind the film is to sweep away the old and make way for a new story\\, and these new characters are nothing to write home about\\, let me tell you. \\n\\nThe characters introduced in Episode 7 and 8 are boring\\, vapid\\, empty\\, unrelatable annoying and most importantly nonsensical. \\n\\nThe story is all of those things\\, in spades. By the end of Episode 8 you aren't sure what's worse\\, the fact you don't remember what the hell just happened or the fact you really don't care. \\n\\nEverything else about the film\\, no matter whether it was well done or not- coasts on the coat tales of former glory. Unconvincing and uninspiring. \\n\\nIt would have been one very tall order had someone told me the coming Star Wars films could be worse than the prequels but boy\\, did they deliver.","true":true}
