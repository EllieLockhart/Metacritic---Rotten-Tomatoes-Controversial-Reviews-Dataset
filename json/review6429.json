Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney Star Wars is not for me. \\nThis movie had a lot of problems. Many parts were boring\\, silly and not holding true to traditional star Wars movies. Not a good story. No hero's journey. Very Inconsistent with other Star Wars movies including TFA. \\nLuke's Character assassination was a slap in the face to fans of one of the greatest heroes in movie history. This was just like what Disney did to Han. Leia was the only original character who did not change. She is still fighting the bad guys. The men wimped out. Pitiful what became of my legendary childhood idols. \\nThis movie should have been called: Spaceballs 2: The Last Schwartz\\, How to sell more toys.","true":true}
