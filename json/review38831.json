Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They had a chance of a lifetime to make a great movie and they blew it big time:\\n1) They killed my childhood hero\\, Luke Skywalker and made him into a character I cannot recognize.That person is not Luke Skywalker but it is not Mark Hamills fault. It reminds me off the mistake Mattel made with Masters of the Universe in the 1980s: They removed the main characters from the toy line and the sales dropped the following year.\\n2) Tried to make parallel scenes from The Empire Strikes Back.\\n3) Time paradoxes.\\n4) Bombs dropping in space! Come on.\\n5) Rose: Almost a annoying as Jar Jar Binks.\\n6) An unscary Kylo Ren as the leader of the evil guys.\\n7) Killing off Snoke in such a bad way and without getting to know who he is? People have been wondering about this for two years!\\n8) No background story for Rey??\\n9) The story in itself: Poorly written.\\n\\nDisney just killed off all the main characters and a lot of the things we loved about Star Wars. I mean\\, almost all the things I remember from my childhood about Star Wars have been transformed or removed. I could have passed that legacy on to our children and grandchildren. I don't want to buy one single piece of merchandise from The Last Jedi because there is almost nothing left of what I love about Star Wars. Its actually quite sad.\\n\\nThe only good things about TLJ is the title\\, Marks Hamills performance and the scene where Luke gets shot at.","true":true}
