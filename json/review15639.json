Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the visuals but the absence of strong male roles\\, the mommyish interference of Holdo to prevent Finn and Po from ever being free to take action and the strong feminist agenda left a bad taste. It is not possible for little boys to identify with any of the male characters and be excited. They have been emasculated - at the heels of Leia\\, evil and confused\\, or absent and irrelevant (Luke). Furthermore the film failed to follow on from The Force Awakens which ended on a high note\\, and managed to destroy all victories that film achieved\\, and destroy all hope for a logical  sequel.","true":true}
