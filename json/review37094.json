Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The one thing that saves the movie and makes it really good is the climactic ending. There were some moments of cheesy dialogue and acting slips\\, there were also moments where the characters were doing things that made me ask \u201cWhy are they doing this?\u201d\\, but overall it\u2019s a pretty good film.","true":true}
