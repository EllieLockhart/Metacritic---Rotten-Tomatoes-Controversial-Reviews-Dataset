Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really wanted to like this movie. \\n\\nBut all it did was make the Star Wars universe smaller to me. In comparison to the books that continued the stories\\, this version of the story brought the saga down. The lead characters are no longer the legends we've lived with for decades\\, but pale shadows of what they once were. \\n\\nEven the new protagonists introduced in the previous film were brought down and made less interesting. I don't care about these characters anymore. \\n\\nLike many\\, I loved the original heroes. I don't love this. It's just a massive disappointment that is a poor bookend for the once great saga.
