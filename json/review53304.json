Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deeply meditative\\, brilliantly dark and often taking brilliant unexpected turns\\, The Last Jedi is very much the \\\"Empire\\\" of the sequel trilogy. Whereas The Force Awakens could be argued to have been playing a little too safe at times for its own good\\, TLJ really shows the potential of what they're trying to do\\, and runs with it\\, to rousing success.\\n\\nAlso\\, it has some absolutely spectacular-looking battle scenes\\, which I won't speak about here for the most part to avoid spoiling it all (there's a particular standout moment for me in a space battle\\, one I'm surprised was never done in the series before\\, and was one of the most spectacular moments in these battles - you'll know what I mean when you see it)\\, but that opening space one alone was enough to give the spectacular opening to \\\"Revenge of the Sith\\\" a run for its money.","true":true}
