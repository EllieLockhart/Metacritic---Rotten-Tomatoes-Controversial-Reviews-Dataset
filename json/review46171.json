Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waiting two years to get this movie. Ouch\\, a punchin the stomach. Never have been so disappointed in a Star Wars film ever. I would write a review but there is just too much to complain about.","true":true}
