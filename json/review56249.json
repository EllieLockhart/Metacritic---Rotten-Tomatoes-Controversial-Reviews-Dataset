Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star  Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is far from a disaster. It's far from anything terrible either. But what this 8th instalment is is static\\, and that is perhaps what remains its greatest downfall. No one character is truly allowed to grow or change in any meaningful way\\, save for Driver's conflicted Kylo Ren\\, and those who do either have their decisions and the significance thereof stripped from them in service of maintaining a status quo. \\n\\nIf 2015's \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was a familiar foray into a world I love dearly that held a great deal of room for improvement\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" would be best described as receiving a slap in the face for liking \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, and then told to cheer when you see someone you recognise. Your movie cannot simultaneously be about letting the past die and recognising that nostalgia may not always be a healthy thing\\, as well as a nostalgic romp that expects you to not care that the new guard are pushed to the sidelines for return appearances of your childhood heroes.\\n\\nYou can't always have your cake and eat it too. Which is it Disney? You tell me.","true":true}
