Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am old enough to have seen the original first Star Wars movie in the theater along with all other movies since on opening night.  And I must say this movie is terrible!!\\n\\nI might not like what Lucas did with 1\\,2 and 3. But the man at least knows how to give us a good choreographed light-saber fight. I thought it odd that several articles hit the media in the past 24hr's where Mark Hamill was making comments on how he wished Disney keep Lucas's vision for the plot. It now completely makes sense. \\n\\nIdiotic inserts of comedy\\, terrible CGI\\, weak action scenes and a plot that feels like a late night film on the SyFy channel.\\n\\nI will giving away my tickets for Saturdays showing!!","true":true}
