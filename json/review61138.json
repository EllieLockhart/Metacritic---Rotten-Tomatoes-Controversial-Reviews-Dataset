Vengeance brings no one and nothing back\\, because it would only bring suffering in the end. I am glad I have experienced this game. The beginning and the end of thid game's dark and gritty sotry made perfect sense. I applaud the developers for their hard work on everything. I applaud the actors for their performances. I applaud this franchise. And I applaud this year for bringing me The Last Of Us Part II.\r\rWhoever down votes this game out of hatred needs to educate themselves more\\, and needs professional help.
