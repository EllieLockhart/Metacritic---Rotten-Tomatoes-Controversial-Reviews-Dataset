Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Inappropriate comedy. Characters make stupid decisions that are contrary to their established personas and their actions have no payoff for their story arc. The tone is all over the place. Every mystery set up in the previous film is revealed to be pointless. Characters die but aside from that nothing really changes in the universe by the end of the film. Felt more like a parody than an actual Star Wars film.","true":true}
