Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As long as you can keep eyes on visuals and FX it's tolerable\\, but it wasn't for me.\\nThe Last Jedi trying too hard to deconstruct Original Trilogy. There is a clear message \\\"Past must die\\\"\\, and this message isn't only to characters\\, but to audience. \\nThe goal of this deconstruction is to throw away all previous Star Wars\\, episodes and Expanded Universe production\\, to cease comparing and complaining\\, like \\\"It was in A New Hope already\\\"\\, or \\\"Zahn wrote about it and it was better\\\". \\nWhile chasing this goal\\, movie misses in other directions. Abundant plot holes\\, bad pace and one-dimensional characters made it awful.","true":true}
