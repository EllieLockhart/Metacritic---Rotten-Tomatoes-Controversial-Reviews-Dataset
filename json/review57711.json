Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unreal best Star Wars yet twist after twist all these amazing creatures was not bored one min!!! And the visuals of that film were stunning!! How they introduced so many new idea for the force just brilliant!! Don\u2019t listen to all these cry baby\u2019s that will hate anything that\u2019s not the first 3!! We all grew up with it things change and movies get better this is a smart powerful film. These people don\u2019t have the maturity to see a good film! There all 35 year old men living with there mothers angry that there is a woman in the lead and different races in the film it\u2019s just to much for them! I\u2019m a man and I can see that!! Watch this movie! One of the best films ever made!!! Still so sad that this is still low! Now we know trolls just sit around all day making fake accounts so they can bring the score down all my friends & family loved this film! My mother who grew up with the originals saw them all in theater! Still says this is her favorite one! It\u2019s so sad I feel bad 4 the ppl who can\u2019t see past the hate in there hearts! & can\u2019t see what a true masterpiece this is! There loss! There complaining won\u2019t change a thing! There drainer there own energy not anyone else\u2019s! ","true":true}
