Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson scraps the energetic and engaging new characters of The Force Awakens for pale\\, uninteresting meandering. The tone and editing makes the weak plot weaker which results in a mess of tacked-on homages\\, revelations with no sense of consequence and a lot of boredom.","true":true}
