Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a 3 star movie but because it was so hyped to be great I gave 2 stars. Leia floating through space was the worst thing ever in a SW movie. Rey and Kylo talking to themselves looked straight up nutty - why not just use voiceover instead of them looking like schizophrenics? I would expect a purple haired SJW to be suicidal but NOT FINN! FInn is the greatest character ever because of Boyega's talents and Rian pooped on him. Although Rose's actions made up Rian's poop. I created this account today because LucasFilm needs to know what the fans are thinking. I thought after TFA that knew the secret formula in making a good movie. They lied.","true":true}
