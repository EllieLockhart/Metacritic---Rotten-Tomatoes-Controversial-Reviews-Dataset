Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a thoroughly bad movie\\, whether you are a Star Wars fan or not. Bad dialogue\\, awful sub-plots that go no where\\, and nonsensical scenes including Leia flying through space like Mary Poppins (this scene may mark the lowest point in the entire Star Wars cinematic universe). Episode VIII's greatest accomplishment is completing the herculean task of making a movie that is worse than the prequels.","true":true}
