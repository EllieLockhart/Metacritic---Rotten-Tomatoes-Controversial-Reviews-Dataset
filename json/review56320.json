Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a huge disappointment. The plot is almost nonsensical at times. Beloved and new characters are treated with no respect. No one has any real character arc and the humor falls flat at every turn. Worst of all\\, it seems that the writer\/director didn\u2019t even take the time to watch the force awakens. A huge misstep in the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
