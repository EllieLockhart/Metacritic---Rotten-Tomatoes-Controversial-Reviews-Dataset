Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't see how \\\"fans\\\" consider this a bad film. They all asked for something more different after The Force awakens. This chapter decides to not only do something different\\, but also to grow the characters from various situations and take this whole story and mythos to a whole new direction. This movie shows me that I can still be surprised by Star Wars movies.","true":true}
