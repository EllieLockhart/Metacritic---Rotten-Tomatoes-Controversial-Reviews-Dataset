Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SUCKED.  Pretty sure Rian Johnson has never seen Star Wars before.\\nSPOILER ALERT:!\\nHe changed all the rules that have been in place for 7 movies:  Now Leia can fly; now Luke can make himself appear via hologram.  He totally changed the story about Kylo Ren and Nights of Ren -- and Leia's reaction makes no sense.  A major let down.  Worse than Jar Jar.","true":true}
