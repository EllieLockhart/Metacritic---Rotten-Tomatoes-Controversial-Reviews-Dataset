Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has the potential to be one of the greatest Star Wars stories ever told. While every indication signified it was heading in that direction\\, director Rian Johnson\\, decided to take a sharp turn\\, right near the finish line\\, and head in the wrong direction. In the previous installment\\, while very familiar\\, certain questions and character developments were set up nicely by J.J Abrams\\, only to be thrown to the \u201ctrash compactor\u201d immediately when Johnson took the reins. While The Last Jedi\\, not only fails to answer many of the questions raised by The Force Awakens\\, it also throws them out the window\\, as if the previous installment never happened and the director wanted to find the quickest way to start from a blank slate. The movie deals with severe pacing issues\\, often feeling too slow\\, too rushed\\, or simply unnecessary. There are several plot holes (one critic counted 13 major plot holes) that should have ever prevented this movie from receiving high reviews. The entire movie builds up to a final moment\\, one every Star Wars fan has been waiting for\\, only to be severely disappointed. While many negatives exist\\, some being unforgivable for die-hard fans\\, there are some positives that made this movie entertaining. First\\, for the most part\\, the imagery and setting was gorgeous and well done. Aside from Canto Bight\\, all the locations are very unique\\, interesting\\, and beautiful. Second\\, while the jokes were horrible and inappropriately placed\\, the dialogue was actually quite good\\, particularly between Rey and Kylo Ren. Third\\, Johnson takes some risk in Star Wars mythology\\, particularly with the force\\, that is rather brilliant and will add to future installments. Overall the movie deals with pacing issues\\, badly written and timed jokes\\, severe plot holes\\, neglect of previous installments\\, and complete disrespect to Luke Skywalker\u2019s character\\, but despite all that it is an entertaining movie\\, with excellent acting\\, imagery\\, dialogue\\, and risk taken that pays off. Simply put\\, casual fans will enjoy it\\, while die-hard fans will be disappointed.","true":true}
