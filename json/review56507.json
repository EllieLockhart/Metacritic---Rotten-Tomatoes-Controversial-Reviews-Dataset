Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force was not with this film. Some newer\\, and progressive fans may enjoy The Last Jedi\\, loyalists of the original trilogy are in for quite a disappointment. JJ Abrams was able to ride the forgiving wave of fan-nostalgia when Disney released his entry\\, Force Awakens in 2015. Sure\\, the plot seemed a bit too familiar\\, and a bit of a re-hash of things seen before. However\\, the story-telling potential with what was set-up in The Force Awakens was enough to forgive the lack of originality. 2 years on\\, the intriguing questions posed by The Force Awakens are poorly answered by The Last Jedi. Some of the biggest mysterious are poorly handled\\, and done so in a careless way...bucking audience expectations. Additionally\\, the problems with The Force Awakens are only magnified tremendously. Director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi borrows heavily from The Empire Strikes Back\\, but does so without any of the charm JJ Abrams brought to The Force Awakens.  When the credits of this film roll you may be left wondering if the Star Wars powerhouse has finally run out of steam....or if the folks at Disney should really spend time creating an original story that stands independent of recycled plots\\, themes\\, and characters.","true":true}
