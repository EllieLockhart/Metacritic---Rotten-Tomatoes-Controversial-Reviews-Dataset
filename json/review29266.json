{"101487":164928,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey and BB-8 are such 'Mary sues' that they take all of the suspense and tension out of most scenes. The element of a good story that keeps you on the edge of your seat is uncertainty. Having the feeling that nothing is within our heros' control\\, but you already know that Rey is going to do everything exactly right and win\\, and become a Jedi\\, and get Luke off his butt and do something. It was very uninteresting. Also\\, Luke Lea and Han were horribly portrayed in both this movie and episode VII. Luke and Han aren't awesome anymore\\, and run away from their problems instead of trying to fix them. (Also does anyone else have a problem with the fact that GRAND MASTER LUKE SKYWALKER was defeated by a scrawny fourteen-year-old padawan? Also\\, it feels like the movie doesn't accomplish anything. In the original cannon the rebellion defeats the Empire\\, forms the New Republic\\, and finishes off the Empirial Remnant. Peace is restored. Then \\\"Star Killer Base\\\" And \\\"Kylo Ren\\\" come along and stop any of that from happening. The New Republic is gone and we are once again reliving the enchantingly fabulaous adventures of scrappy rebels always outnumbered\\, on the run\\, and hopelessly outgunned. Over and over again. And now we are literally down to ONE ship of survivors meanwhile the \\\"First Order\\\" seems to able to pull innumerable amounts of weapons and soldiers from their armpits whenever they feel like it. There's a term in writing called 'Tension and Release' I'll give an example: Tangled. If you haven't already seen the movie\\, it's pretty easy to understand. Rapunzel and Flynn go through all of these trials and Flynn almost dies and there's a lot of suspense\\, but then the villain is defeated\\, our plucky heroes are safe and sound\\, and then Rapunzel finds her true parents and they all live happily ever after. After the danger passes\\, the audience breathes a sigh of relief\\, giving everyone a satisfying ending. Now abviously there have been bad examples of this in many films\\, but this movie seems to have no release at all\\, leaving (me at least) feeling unsatisfied with the ending. The \\\"Rebelion\\\" is basically about to die\\, unless our amazing heroine doesn't save the day at the last minute again. There are many many more things about this film that could nit pick at\\, but it's a miracle that you haven't already gotten bored reading all of this already\\, so I'll leave you to your own opinion now\\, but I would like to close with this: The original Star Wars films were basically a space fantasy opera. That may be a little too sophisticated way of saying it\\, but it gets the point across. It had a lot of thought and honest hard work put into it\\, with many people contributing to it's final form from George Lukas's wife to Mark Hammel and the rest of the cast themselves. It was an amazing adventure; one that I believe can never be repeated. So I ask of you and of Disney: May we not simply enjoy what we already have instead of going after something that will forever be out of reach? For as long as we live\\, I believe that we will never again re-create the original formula that brought us one of the greatest sagas ever known.","true":true}
