Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is disappointing. From the visual point of view very well achieved\\, but as terrible story and structure. The humor is bizarre and takes emotional weight away from the story. The dialogues are basic\\, the new characters are too two-dimensional and the story disrespects the previous films\\, both the original trilogy and the first film in this new trilogy.","true":true}
