Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely HORRIBLE! I waited 34  years to see Luke Skywalker back in true form action once again only to be exposed to a 2 1\/2 hour  humiliation of Skywalker while being force-fed social PC garbage buried throughout a collage of weak subplots performed by purposeless characters. Hey Kathleen this is Rian........I have a great idea........let's take the one Star Wars character that everyone loves and adores and turn him into a washed up\\, scared\\, weak\\, paranoid fool! Great idea Rian let's do it!","true":true}
