Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"REALLY wanted to like this movie. However\\, the biggest issue I had was the TERRIBLE mischaracterization of Luke and Yoda. Luke\\, the young boy who refused to give in to the dark side and successfully turned his father\\, would NEVER even consider killing his own nephew. And Yoda\\, a leader on the Jedi Council and one of the wisest characters\\, would NEVER tell Luke that the Jedi texts aren\u2019t important and burn it down... The other thing that really bothered me was the comedy. IT WAS SO OUT OF PLACE. Not only was it not timed right\\, but it wasn\u2019t the right tone for Star Wars. I was kinda half expecting Iron Man to pop out at the end... It all comes down to BAD WRITING. This movie honestly makes TFA and even parts of the prequels feel like masterpieces. ","true":true}
