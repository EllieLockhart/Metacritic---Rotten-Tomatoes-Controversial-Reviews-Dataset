Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It would take a miracle to save SW now.  The Last Jedi was the last SW film I see.  Beautiful to look at\\, depressingly bad.  I don't what it is with the fascination to make every original trilogy character a disappointment\\, but I for one have had quite enough of it.  My Star Wars ended with Return Of The Jedi.","true":true}
