{"101487":175507,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is thematically about ending the ties to the past (Kylo Ren drives the metaphor home literally\\, several times)\\, and it's an understandable goal. After all\\, how does the series continue on its' own if it is rooted in the original trilogy? There would be little room for creativity that most fans probably crave.\\n\\nThat being said\\, The Last Jedi is a weak installment. The plot twists are handled quickly; once is shocking\\, twice is alright\\, three times or more and it's annoying. The treatment of one character's story is handled poorly (even with understanding the point of letting go and dying a peaceful life in a struggle-filled life). Some scenes or laughable in a bad way (Leia in space). There was an odd romance arc that had not a trace of build-up that came out of the blue. There is also a villain problem\\, as the antagonist for the series seems rather weak and ineffectual.\\n\\nWhat killed it for me though\\, was the pacing of the story. This is a long movie\\, and the majority of the plot revolves around... waiting for the good guys to run out of gas. The resolutions are handled quickly and abruptly\\, while the seemingly insignificant parts are dragged out.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, it's still a star wars movie\\, but it's probably one of the worst I have seen.","true":true}
