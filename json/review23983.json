Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many pacing issues\\, many plot holes\\, disrespecting beloved characters\\, and contradicts all that was built during the previous movie. The only redeeming part of this movie was the phenomenal acting in the face of poor writing.","true":true}
