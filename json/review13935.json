Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you can warp into another ship and cause devastation on that level\\, none of Star Wars makes sense anymore.  Why didn't they do that at the start? Why would the Empire even attempt to build death stars? Why is every space battle not automated ships hyper driving into enemy ships?  How did Finn get Rose all the way back to the base from in front of the entire Imperial (whoops I meant First Order) attack force without being shot down?  How did Rey escape the ship and get back to the Falcon?  Who knows?!?!! They didn't bother to think about these things\\, and neither should you.  Focus on all the awesome world building they've done to flesh out the current state of the Star Wars universe....oops\\, they didn't do that either.  It's a throwaway popcorn flick with a coat of Star Wars on it.  I expected Episode 8 to expand upon the groundwork of 7.  It did not.  Disney is just going to keep churning out Star Wars flicks\\, not because they have a story to tell\\, but because there's money to be had.  I guess that's fine\\, but I think I'll just hop off the hype train here.  It's been real Star Wars.","true":true}
