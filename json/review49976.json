Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You're left with Adam Driver's petulant temper tantrums leading a galaxy wide empire that had trouble killing a couple of henchmen guards early in the movie.  Rey\\, who can now move rocks\\, Luke disappeared for no reason after his main purpose was to be a distraction after 30 years of exile\\, God only knows what the Leia's wicked witch of the west scene was about\\, Snoke got so caught up in a hate orgasm that he did not sense his own demise\\, the rebels biggest issue was not having a gas station around\\, Finn went to a casino\\, rode a floppy eared donkey so that he could kiss an asian woman\\, and a kid at the end uses the force to sweep crap off of a freighter.  That is the story\\, that is what you are left with\\, a bunch of who cares what happens next.  Pretty sad when you can make phantom menace look like an award winner","true":true}
