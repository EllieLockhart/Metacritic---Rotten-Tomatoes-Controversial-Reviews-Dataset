Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This one finally lives up to the reputation of being a star wars movie. While not the direction I had hoped it would go\\, this movie is the best one after the original trilogy.","true":true}
