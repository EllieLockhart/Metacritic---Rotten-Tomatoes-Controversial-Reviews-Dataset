Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as Episodes I\\, II and III\\, but this movie is terrible. I gave it 1 star because I did really like some (BUT NOT ALL) of the visuals. I genuinely could not have been more disappointed by this movie. I know that Disney is trying to say that the \\\"rotten\\\" viewer score is a hoax done by upset fans\\, but it's not. This movie is bad on SO many levels far beyond the \\\"fanboys\\\" that might have wanted things to go differently. If anything is a hoax about the response to this movie\\, it's the critics reviews and other audience scores. I only know one person that liked the movie and everyone else has disliked it as much as\\, if not more than\\, myself. And\\, my many dislikes aside\\, the two things that bothered me most are that the movie is actually quite boring and the story is silly\/stupid. In some ways\\, the story is possibly more silly than Lucas' Episodes I\\,II\\, and III. The dialog and acting might make this story seem better than Episodes I-III\\, but when you really look at the story arc\\, this was just awful.","true":true}
