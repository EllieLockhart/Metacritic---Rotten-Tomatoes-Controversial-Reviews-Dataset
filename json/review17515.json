Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I share many options with other people. For instance\\, Canto Bight was pointless and hypocritical\\, too many corny Marvel-like Jokes\\, Luke and Auckbar were butchered\\, and nobody except for MaRey Sue Rey cared that Han died. Not at all excited for TROS.","true":true}
