Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disgusting and exploitative film if you can even call if a film in good conscience - it's a slap in the face to the original trilogy\\, those who love the original trilogy\\, and the ideas and characters that made those movies great.\\n\\nBad story telling\\, nonsensical plot\\, poor characters\\, one missed opportunity after another.  All these I can forgive.  What I can't forgive is the shameful mishandling of the Star Wars universe and particularly of its beloved iconic characters.  Luke is pathetic in this movie.  He's not Luke - Luke is Star Wars - I can understand why he needs to be out of the way to tell the next chapter\\, but he should have died a hero\\, he should have died with a noble sacrifice.  Star Wars operates on the level of archetype\\, it's why it has such a  broad cultural appeal\\, it's why the characters are beloved and celebrated.  It's about the hero's journey\\, the noble sacrifice\\, good vs evil.  This movie has none of that\\, and I believe that it rejects these things on purpose.\\n\\nThe writing and direction utterly failed in this movie.  Disney\\, and particularly JJ and Rian\\, lack the creative vision and general competence to properly do Star Wars\\, they're just milking it for money at this point.\\n\\nThis movie is downright offensive to the Star Wars universe.   It is a complete metaphysical inversion of everything that makes Star Wars Star Wars.  Cynical nihilists will probably love it\\, but cynical nihilists never \\\"got\\\" Star Wars to begin with.  I don't understand how it was even approved to be made.\\n\\nStar Wars\\n1977-2017\\nRIP","true":true}
