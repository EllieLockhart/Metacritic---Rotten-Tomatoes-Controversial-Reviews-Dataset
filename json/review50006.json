Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yowza\\, this movie stunk.  The only good thing that I can see coming from this dreck is if episode IX opens with Rey waking up and realizing that everything we saw in episode VIII was a dream (nightmare).  That would make me feel a lot better about this hideous display in TLJ.\\n\\nAnything short of that and I'll really and truly believe that Disney is purposely trying to drive the old fans away.  They must be really tone deaf.  Check out SW facebook page...they are really trying to heap on to some of the things the fans disliked most about this movie.  Posts with pictures of Canto Bight (most fans least-liked scene).  Posts about Rose (most fans least-liked new character)\\, calling her a HERO???  Posts with pictures of Porgs (most fans know this is a merchandise ploy).  \\n\\nNot sure what they are playing at...I guess I would like to see them acknowledge that TLJ was a massive misstep and move on.  Quit trying to pass of your shitty story and characters off as anything other than the shit they are.","true":true}
