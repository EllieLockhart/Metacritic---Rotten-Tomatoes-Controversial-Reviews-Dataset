Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In The Force Awakens you kill off Han with no character payoff (Ben still an a hole)\\, now you kill off Luke by using a cheap magician's trick. He never truly faced a difficult battle\\, and as a Jedi Master - what a waste. Not another dime Star Wars\\, we're done.","true":true}
