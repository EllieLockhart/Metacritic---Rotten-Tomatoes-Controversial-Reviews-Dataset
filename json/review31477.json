{"101487":168597,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Some spoilers\\, but nothing too major) In Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson takes the Star Wars franchise in a bold new direction. Whereas The Force Awakens plays it safe\\, relies on plot similarities\\, and is more fun (it is also a solid film\\, IMO)\\, The Last Jedi does not care about your expectations\\, or the fan theories which either you devised or you bought into: it is meant to be unpredictable and to shock you (after my first viewing\\, I walked out of the theater feeling like I got the wind knocked out of me). Your fan theories for plot or character development that you had for this film are very likely wrong\\, which is something that I actually appreciate about this movie: Rian Johnson takes this saga in a new direction and makes this movie very unforeseeable. Rian Johnson writes two themes into this film and executes their application well. First is this idea that maybe the lines between good and evil are a little more blurred\\, and the Force requires balance between the light and the dark. This doesn't mean that we see the concept of Grey Jedi\\, but maybe our new heroes (or villains) need to adopt only the teachings and maxims of the Force which make the most sense and don't make someone blind to underlying problems. This theme leads to a much bigger theme which is prevalent throughout this whole film: Failure. Pretty much every single character in The Last Jedi commits failure\\, faces failure and has to confront failure. Even Luke points out how the Old Jedi Order failed miserably\\, and that the Force doesn't just belong to the Old Jedi Order (my own input\/analysis now: but maybe Rey can properly learn from previous Jedi failures to better understand a proper balance and which maxims she should adopt going forward as she continues to learn about the Force). Many characters on both sides in this film have to learn from failure in the future in order to save their side\\, achieve greater personal power or power in the Force\\, and\/or fulfill their destiny. \\nThe 3 characters that Rian did the best job with in this film are Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo. The character development for each has depth\\, substance\\, and the element of surprise. Each character must deal with conflict\\, failure\\, frustration\\, and figuring out not only who they are\\, but what their role is in the fight between the First Order and the Resistance. The nostalgic little kid in you (and me) will not like the character traits and arc of Luke in this film\\, but his story and internal struggle and grief are actually intriguing\\, and make sense based on what we find out during the film. Mark Hamill turns in what might be his best performance as Luke Skywalker\\, in which he had to reinvent his portrayal of the iconic character. Luke was overwhelmed by the burden of living up to his legend status that he had to deal with\\, and his flaws from the original trilogy end up causing his failures\\, which is interesting and goes to show how anyone can slip back into bad habits or characteristics. Daisy Ridley turns in another solid\\, charismatic performance as Rey\\, and does a good job portraying a character which has to deal with disappointment\\, sadness\\, feeling letdown and shocked that a legend\\, mentor\\, and second fatherly figure didn't meet her expectations\\, the emotional pain of not knowing who she is and if she's important\\, and what her place in the fight and as a possible Jedi are. Adam Driver is excellent\\, too\\, and does a really good job at showing Kylo's conflict and intersecting of emotions (embracing the darkness vs. the call to the Light\\, and\\, like Rey\\, feeling alone and feeling letdown by a mentor\/teacher\/master).\\nA few more things about this movie that I liked: First\\, I agree with what happened with Snoke's character. Second\\, I'm fine with Rey's parentage\\, as it establishes the idea that the Force isn't solely a hereditary power\\, and that anyone of any background can have outstanding Force sensitivity and power\\, and can also play a vital role in making in impact in the galaxy. Additionally\\, this movie struck a solid balance between honoring the original movies with a couple of emotional\\, poignant\\, and touching scenes\\, and also letting the past die and charting a new course for the characters and the saga as a whole.\\nRian Johnson's skills and talents as a director and a creative filming mind are on display\\, with some truly outstanding shots and visuals (1. The red and white contrast on Crait\\, with the ski speeders kicking up the red salts and particles was beautiful and unique. 2. The cinematography of the ship collision scene is brilliant and jaw-dropping).\\nWhile I am certainly pleased with this film overall\\, there are still a few flaws and issues with this installment of Star Wars. First\\, the Canto Bight scenes dragged a bit too much. Rian was trying to establish backstory as to why a new\\, younger generation would want to support the Resistance despite the galaxy having lost almost all hope\\, but the movie still spent too much time there for what was the least compelling plot line of TLJ. I would've rather seen the third lesson between Luke and Rey (which was filmed but deleted). Second\\, there were a couple of characters who were wasted or not used effectively. Third\\, I'm not a fan of Rose's character arc\\, though it should also be said that I at least appreciate her character's role in helping develop Finn's character. \\nI give this movie a 90-93%. Rian Johnson has moved the Star Wars saga forward and unlocked new possibilities for the saga\\, while also giving JJ Abrams a lot of room and freedom to work with for Episode IX.","true":true}
