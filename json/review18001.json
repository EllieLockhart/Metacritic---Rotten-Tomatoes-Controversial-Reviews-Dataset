Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that this was a very good follow up to The Force Awakens.  The humor was excellent\\, but maybe the Chewbacca eating porg might have been better served if it may have been a little shorter and not dragged on.   I was laughing out of my seat when Poe was messing with Hux.   \\n\\nI think many people were really disappointed with Luke's first reaction to being handed his own Light Saber\\, but I think it was both hilarious and a powerful way to establish the state his character was in at the time.  I will admit that I was a little saddened at the backstory with Luke and Ben\/Kylo Ren\\, but this is a legitimate fear and it did shadow the fears that the Jedi Order had when dealing with the rise of the Sith in the prequel\\, especially sentiment of Mace Windu when he tried to kill Darth Sidious.   Just like that sealed the deal in Anakin's turn to the dark side\\, Luke sealed the deal in Ben's turn to the dark side.  \\n\\nThis has many plot points that were borrowed from both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi\\, but I think that the way that they were done was a perfect way to both show the similarities of the character's journeys but also contrast those journeys as well.  Overall I think this movie will be one of my favorite behind Return of the Jedi.  I'm pretty sure that the fact that Empire Strikes Back is not my favorite of the original trilogy will lose me \\\"street cred\\\" among the most faithful Star Wars fans\\, but I'm not here to tow the line\\, I'm here to be genuinely entertained\\, and this movie did just that.","true":true}
