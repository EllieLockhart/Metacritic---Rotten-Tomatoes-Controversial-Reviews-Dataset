Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pumpa pe pepepepi pe pepepepi pe pepepepe.. :D The Great\\, Legendary\\, John Williams' One of The Best Themes.. This is the First thing you'll hear when someone says \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, Isn't it.? ;) And our Desi awards stole even that :P\\n\\nFirst thing first\\, when I heard about Princess Leia\\, Carrie Fisher\\, I just couldn't believe the news. I was so shocked. Then & then\\, I decided to watch this movie if no other reason but to give my respect to Carrie. She was The Best. May her Soul Rest In Peace. She did Fabulous work in this movie. Salute to her.\\n\\nNow\\, the story isn't going ahead much. I'm a Spoiler-Free reviewer so I'll not spoil anything but the movie definitely could've been better if written well. General overview which every Star Wars movie has in the beginning\\, In a galaxy\\, far far away...\\n\\nOnly one group of Resistance\\, a Spark\\, is there to fight the Supreme Leader. Meanwhile\\, Rey is trying to convince Luke Skywalker to train her so that she can control her Force\\, Light\\, & be able to fight Kylo Ren. Everything beyond would be Spoiler\\, So\\, Just Chill\\, I won't spoil it.\\n\\nNow\\, performances..\\n\\n~ Daisy Ridley did Awesome job as Rey.. Just FYI\\, She's The Last Jedi.. Sssshhhh\\, don't tell anyone.. ;)\\n\\n~ Oscar Isaac\\, Ma Man\\, Poe.. I'd love to watch him again & again. Just Fabulous Actor.. Poe is the New Han Solo ;)\\n\\n~ Adam Driver\\, Kylo Ren's struggling character played well. His character could've been written better.\\n\\n~ Mark Hamill\\, in the beninging :D (I just remembered that video :D ) He's Pain in the A\\, eventually he becomes less pain in the A ;)\\n\\n~ John Boyega\\, Finn\\, He's Alive :) Supported well.\\n\\n~ Andy Serkis\\, Snoke\\, The Supreme Leader.. So Awesome He is.. You know what I did here ;)\\n\\n~ Domhnall Gleeson\\, General Hux\\, Ohh Poor him :D\\n\\n~ Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata\\, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma\\, Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico\\, Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo\\, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO\\, Jimmy Vee as R2-D2 All did Very Well..\\n\\nLast but not the Least\\, BB-8\\, I just Love It :D\\n\\nOn the Whole\\, The Last Jedi is The Best Entertainer you get at the Year End.. Don't Miss It ;)\\n\\nMy Rate for The Last Jedi is... *drum rolls*... AWESOMETECULAR (Yeah\\, It's Stolen :P )","true":true}
