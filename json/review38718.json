Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing in this movie is just terrible.  There were pointless subplots and characters that did nothing for the plot. Rey is a Mary Sue who still has no training through 2 movies but is good at everything. Luke Skywalker spent an entire movie trying to turn Darth Vader good but all of a sudden is terrified of Kylo Ren and almost kills him. Luke also spent an entire trilogy as the optimistic hero and turned into a whiny little bitch drinking milk out of an aliens tit. They have completed ruined his character and none of the changes make any sense. Forced dumb humor where not necessary. The list goes on and on.","true":true}
