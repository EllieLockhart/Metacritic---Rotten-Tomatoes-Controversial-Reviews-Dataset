Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial reaction was that this movie was entertaining\\, had exciting visuals and did a serviceable job with the main cast. The more I thought deeply about the subplots\\, the connections\\, or lack thereof\\,  to the previous film and how it handles the original trilogy cast and lore the more I realized this was a terrible Star Wars movie.\\n[SPOLIERS]\\nIt's message about how being a hero and undergoing heroic sacrifice was the wrong thing to do and yet depending on said heroes to save the day was confusing. As well as the philosophy of burying the past.  None of it made much sense.  Not learning from the past dooms you to repeat it. Not only  were these messages confusing but the entire casino plotline was pointless if Admiral Huldo just let Poe in on the plan. Luke acted like none of the lessons learned or things he fought for in his trilogy mattered which was completely out of character. His contempt for the Jedi order was interesting but his apathy towards the resistance made no sense.  Why wouldn't he help his sister!? Its just all rather confusing and if any of the filmmakers had even seen the previous films they would agree this one was unfaithful as well was a slap in the face of hardcore fans.","true":true}
