Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie and what it did to foil the original trilogy. A lot of the \\\"plot holes\\\" aren't actually holes. Lots of details are hinted at only\\, no full exposition like the classics. Excited to see the conclusion of the Skywalker saga in the next installment.","true":true}
