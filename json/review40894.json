Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie deserves a lot more than it\u2019s getting from people who are afraid of something sacred changing its ways so late in the game. Loved it\\, go see it.","true":true}
