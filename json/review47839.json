Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? The writing is poor - both dialogue and storyline are among the worst of the franchise. Attempts at humor often miss the mark and flat out fail in some scenes. The plot holes are so numerous and obvious that they begin to distract from the movie before it\u2019s even over. And there are too many subplots. This felt like script by committee. ","true":true}
