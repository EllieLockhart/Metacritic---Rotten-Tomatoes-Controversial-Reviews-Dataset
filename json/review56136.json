Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie ever made. Director Rian Johnson should be ashamed of what he created. He took 30 years worth of character development and spat on it. Im a huge star wars fan and this movie convinced me that the saga is over. I will never support another star wars movie made by Disney","true":true}
