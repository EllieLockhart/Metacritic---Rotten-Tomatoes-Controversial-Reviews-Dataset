Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the salty low scores from bitter fans\\, who think they are entitled and upset the movie didn't go like they expected or predicted.  Complaining about stuff that they accept fine in the OT  lol  This movie was great and different.","true":true}
