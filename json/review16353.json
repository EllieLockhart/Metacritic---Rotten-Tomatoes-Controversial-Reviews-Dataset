Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm only giving this movie one star because RT doesn't count half a star. this movie is trash. it defecates all over star wars' past\\, present\\, future\\, and fandom. even all the political BS aside\\, this is a horrible movie. Like\\, bad fan-fiction horrible. it's seriously mind-boggling how bad this movie is and how much damage it has done to the star wars franchise.","true":true}
