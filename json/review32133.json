Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers.  Utterly disappointing and unfulfilling and I was so hopeful after The Force Awakens and Rogue One which were both excellent and true to the Star Wars mythos.  The Last Jedi  gives us all that the middle finger.   What I saw was Luke Skywalker's legacy destroyed\\, Rey is nobody (surprising yes\\, dramatic no\\, good job Johnson)\\, the omnipotent big bad killed with a flick of the wrist (no explanation of  who or where he came from either\\, why was he in the films?)\\, Rey mysteriously escapes off screen from her showdown with Ren\\, Ren still raging like a child\\, Finn and Rose accomplish nothing and fail their mission\\, and the rebellion utterly destroyed\\, hardly a single upbeat or hopeful moment in this film.  Easily the biggest downer of all the Star Wars films and will undoubtedly go down as one of the most controversial among audiences and the fan base.","true":true}
