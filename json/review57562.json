Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was the biggest letdown since episode 1... the a-hole who directed this movie burned every plot bridge that j.j. Abrams had carefully constructed to carry the trilogy on through the next couple episodes\\, and wrote the characters completely ass backwards to the rest of the movies. there was also a major kaibosh on any men taking charge of any situation and an underlying tone that male role-models are not to be trusted with the lives of their friends\/family. overall it was tolerable as a movie but a horrible \\\"star wars\\\" movie and a complete insult as an installment to the new triolgy. help us j.j. Abrams... you're our only hope!","true":true}
