Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as I have heard. I was really surprised that TLJ had some totally unpredictable scenes. While not perfect\\, still a solid piece of the SW story. Fans are really nitpicking it. \\n \\nSpoilers: Leia flying through space was a bit corny\\, but that's what happens in movies. Luke had a believable exit.  Kylo is so immature and full of hubris\\, and I'm surprised he's still around honestly. His General is likely going to mess up his life in the next installment\\, as they HATE \\neach other.","true":true}
