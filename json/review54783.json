{"101487":140520,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think 2 stars was too generous. The more I think about it\\, the less stars this piece of excuse of a film deserves. The half star is there for the visual effects. As for a full review\\, I'll wait until it comes out on DVD so I can comprehensively deconstruct this mess and show you exactly why it's so terrible. And Rotten Tomatoes critics\\, you are probably like that guy who works for Buzzfeed on BoJack Horseman","true":true}
