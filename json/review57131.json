Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review. I\u00b4m an all time Star Wars fan since I saw The Return of the Jedi on the movies back in the 80\u00b4s. Each and every movie has been a wonderful experience for me\\, and for my kids\\, who became fans themselves with the prequels. Say what you want about them\\, but they were entertaining and captivating for kids. But enough of the backstory. THIS MOVIE WAS A DISASTER. I mean\\, it was beautifully made\\, the cinematography was gorgeous\\, but the story and the storytelling was pure and absolute CRAP. Rian Johnson and whoever wrote the script managed to tear apart everything we grew up admiring about Star Wars\\, turning Luke Skywalker\\, the same Luke Skywalker who abandoned his training to save his friends in Cloud City\\, the same Skywalker who turned the most badass villain in the whole universe into the light side\\, the same Skywalker\\, well you get my point\\, they manage to turn him into a bitter wimp who won\u00b4t get his hands dirty even for his twin sister.  They fail to reveal the source of all mighty powerful Rey\u00b4s powers\\, they fail to explain Patricide Kylo Ren motives\\, heck\\, they even fail to explain who the hell is Snoke\\, who at time feels more powerful than every Sith before him.  The movie is a mess\\, and only screws us by taking our greatest heroes in the galaxy and turning them to nothing.  I\u00b4m beyond words to explain what a mess this movie created.  BTW\\, kudos to JJ Abrams\\, who managed to create the least likeable and reedemable villain in Kylo Ren. I mean\\, Anakin\/Vader\u00b4s story was great\\, because he was as great a hero as he was a villain\\, he saved as many lives as he killed\\, but he NEVER did anything to the point we could think was unredeemable. (not even killing younglings). He really became Vader when he tought he had killed Padme and his child by mistake\\, but we knew different. He saved Luke when he was about to die. But Kylo is a freaking patricide who killed his father in cold blood and saw his mother blow into space and did nothing. JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson only needed to make him a paedophile priest to make him the most unredeemable person EVER. So\\, it\u00b4s not as we are waiting for him to turn to the light\\, we COULDN\u00b4T CARE LESS if he was hanged by the balls by all eternity.  Way to go screenwriters !!","true":true}
