Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So they want to kill a fairy tail? Congrats...they did it with a story that made no sense...with no character arcs...while trying to bury the base of the franchise in a movie where you weer not sure what was the point of anything. Visuals were nice...","true":true}
