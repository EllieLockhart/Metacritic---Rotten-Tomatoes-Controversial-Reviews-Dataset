Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stunning. Rian Johnson made a great Star Wars film that had its controversial points\\, but they were necessary to expand the series and Star Wars in general. Weird seeing the story move past the Skywalkers as being the central focus\\, but it needed to be done. Also\\, cudos to RJ for completely giving the bird to JJ Abrams\u2019 biggest story plot holes left in TFA. Amazing SW movie... maybe the best one. ","true":true}
