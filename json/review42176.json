Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie seemed designed to kill off everything beloved in Star Wars.  From its opening scroll when you are casually told that everything your heroes fought for for the last 4 movies counted for nothing and now the Rebellion is a few hundred fugitives on a handful of ships to the flippant dismissal of any every Star Wars sacred cow - I felt like the movie's creators hated Star Wars and wanted it dead.  Over and over in the movie we are told you must \\\"kill the past\\\" - it seems that was the directors goal\\, and he succeeded.  The Star Wars franchise is dead to me now.","true":true}
