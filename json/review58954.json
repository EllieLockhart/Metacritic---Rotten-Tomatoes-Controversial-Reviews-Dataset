This game in terms ofFinished it yesterday and I got to say\\, this is a goddamn masterpiece that only comes along every once in a while. Last few times were Death stranding RE2 Remake and Red dead 2. And seeing all these salty streamers that have to react to cynical viewers and seem to struggle hiding and processing their real emotions and human feelings only makes me feel sorry for them. This game in terms of gameplay\\, graphics\\, level design\\, music and sounddesign etc\\, raises the bar for the industry. The story is so dark\\, hard and such an emotional rollercoaster\\, that it will leave you beaten and bruised by the end and gives you a lot to reflect about. Unlike what you might hear online\\, the story is VERY last of us. It just takes - maybe unexpected - themes and dynamics from the first game\\, and takes them to their logical conclusion. And seeing and playing this\\, will leave you feeling very uncomfortable\\, but that is a good thing. And people who make fun of these things\\, like streamers and youtubers\\, seem to do so\\, because they have some sort of persona to keep high and it\u2019s easy to just join the meme outrage train. And the stuff in the story they seem to complain about\\, just makes them look like a bunch of pansies.\rI\u2019ll be honest\\, there are some moments that require you to suspend your disbelief\\, but it will cause an eye roll at best (if you can let that stuff go). But all and all\\, story wise\\, it might be up there with games like Read Dead (1&2)\\, Nier: Automata and Spec-ops: the Line\\, probably exceeding that last one.\rIn any case\\, if you own a PS4\\, you owe it to yourself to at least give this a try. Streamers make money off of making cynical rage videos and take any opportunity to do so. Don\u2019t let that ruin the fun for you. And again\\, I feel sorry for the people who didn\u2019t enjoy this as much as I did\\, because I haven\u2019t felt these emotions playing a videogame in a long\\, long time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
