Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: the Last Jedi had a few truly magnificent scenes. The opening battle with Poe Dameron comes to mind. Warning\\, spoilers ahead. \\n\\nIt also had many scenes that were truly execrable \\, such as the overly animated ride through the casino planet\\, and the introduction of the \\\"magic pixie dream girl\\\" Admiral Holdo. \\n\\nIt was a film that appeared to be designed by committee\\, where everyone got their favorite part or character added\\, but gave no depth to any of them. Characters that seemed destined for great showdowns simply died with little more than a whimper\\, and no explanation for where they came from\\, or why they were so powerful (Supreme leader snoke)\\, while others brought us dialogue such as \\\" that's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate\\, saving what we love.\\\" Clearly no one at the writer's table has ever served...\\n\\nIt's a boring\\, jumbled mess with a nice opening scene\\, and a final showdown that makes little sense other than to kill off characters who clearly want to be anywhere else (Luke).  You would be forgiven for thinking Lucas stepped back in to direct\\, with the extreme overuse of CG\\, the ignorance of what happens to human beings in a vacuum\\, and the incredibly wooden acting.\\n\\nTo top it off\\, the same committee must have been dominated by people that were far more interested in \\\"combating\\\" social justice issues than telling a coherent story. While the inclusion of diversity was welcome\\, the attempts to promote women's empowerment came off as pandering\\, and more concerned with making the male characters look foolish than anything else. \\n\\nIf \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was a triumphant return to what made the original so compelling\\, this movie is only good if you are particularly nostalgic for the prequel trilogy\\, with which it shares eerie similarities\\, right down to the characters that obviously serve no other purpose than to sell toys. \\n\\nAbsolutely NOT recommended.","true":true}
