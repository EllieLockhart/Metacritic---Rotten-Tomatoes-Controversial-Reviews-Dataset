Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has killed Star Wars for me. Finn and his new girlfriend wasted 45 minutes of a movie that is already too long. Their story had NO impact on the movie. Kylo and Rey don't develop\\, they just stay light and dark. Snoke was built up to be something major but ended up pretty minimal. Hey Disney\\, you have some money\\, spring for a good make up artist. You should have hired someone off the set of walking dead\\, but you wasted money on another CGI character. Luke is the only one with an interesting story line and he is the only reason for a star. The dialogue was campy. The story was jumbled and answered no questions\\, and left me with no mystery. Not only did you kill star wars for me\\, you have killed science fiction\/fantasy.","true":true}
