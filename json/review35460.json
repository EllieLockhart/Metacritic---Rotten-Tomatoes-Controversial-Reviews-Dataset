Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi disrespects the characters and the Star Wars universe as a hole with virtually every character either being underdeveloped\\, underused or changed completely for the worse. The movie creates a mess leaving countless plot holes and subplots that do not advance the story in any way. It\u2019s as if Rian Johnson wrote this film to purposely hurt the fanbase. I\u2019ve never walked out of a theater feeling this devastated. ","true":true}
