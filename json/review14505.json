Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate it becauae they made luke Skywalker is a whiny\\, selfish childish character..... he is a jedi master.. he refuse the dark side during the final confrontation with the emperor.. he has a good sense of justice and wise.. how come he try to kill his nephew just because he sense the dark side inside of him.. silly... they destroy the image of ljke skywalker thatbive known and loved..","true":true}
