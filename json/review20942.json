Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was expecting so much after a long wait. Rian delivered a SW film that went nowhere\\, filled with plot holes and disappointment as well as completely disrespecting the veteran characters. And what's with the feminism? Why are you also lecturing me on animal abuse and the wealthy? Why did you cast a star wars fangirl in the movie? Nobody cares about Rose\\, she's a pointless character. I left the Force Awakens anxious to see episode 8. I left the Last Jedi with no desire to see episode 9. Thanks Rian\\, you made me lose interest in Star Wars.","true":true}
