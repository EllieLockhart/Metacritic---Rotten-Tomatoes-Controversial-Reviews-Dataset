Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How in the world does this movie get a 93%? I guess the formula is as long as you have an exciting chase seen at the end that's all people will remember. The is no gravitas to the movies since Disney took over. There are practically no storylines.   Most of this movie revolves around chasing the rebels\\, and stuff on Luke's island that are of no consequence at all. The writers don't 'get' Star Wars like Lucas did. It's a shame. The magic is gone.","true":true}
