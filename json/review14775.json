Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen most Star Wars film multiple times\\, but I don't think I'll bother again with this one.  The plot has MASSIVE holes in it (no spoiler comments here)\\, some of the characters are really poorly developed \/ unnecessary\\, scenes (as another reviewer noted) are not needed \/ confuse things\\, and no\\, gravity doesn't happen in space\\, which negates a crucial 10 minutes of the film (so\\, a little bit of spoiling here).  My family and I - wife and 2 sons - all walked out with \\\"meh\\\" as our review\\, and each from different perspectives.  If we add up all our \\\"mehs\\\"\\, we probably would give it 2 stars\\, except that it's Star Wars\\, and the CGI is outrageously incredible.  The effects get 5 stars\\, the plot\\, character development\\, and unnecessary \/ ridiculous scenes get 2 stars.   I can't recommend it to anyone other than Star Wars fans.","true":true}
