Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! I've been a SW fan as long as I can remember (I am 45). It is visually stunning\\, especially the ships fighting. I didn't find that it jumped around like other are saying. Is it different? Yes. Is it a great continuation of a story we all adore? Yes. Are SW \\\"fans\\\" whining? Absolutely!","true":true}
