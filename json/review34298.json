Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst star wars movie ever.  If they don't care about the previous Star Wars storylines and characters\\, then neither do I.  I will sadly walk away from Star Wars and just pretend that this movie does not exist.  What a disaster.","true":true}
