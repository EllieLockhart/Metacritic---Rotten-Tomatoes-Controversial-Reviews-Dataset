Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So\\, this is seemingly going against hte majority of people\\, but here goes: The game is good. At least the game on its own.\r\rThe story is enjoyable\\, and while I absolutely hated Abby and hated playing as her\\, playing her made sense in the grand scheme of thing\\, which was: You pay a big price for revenge and can get lost in hate.\r\rThe biggest problem Last of Us 2 has are:\r\r1) It is not as good as Last of Us 1. With Last of Us 1\\, they set the bar very high\\, and last of us 2 needed to at least meet that\\, but it didn't\r2) Questionable character decision: Joel told us not to trust any stranger in the first Last of Us. Joel knew not to just outright invite them or follow them into the cabin\\, and yet he did. Why? Because it was the easiest way of writing it. I didn't feel that was Joel making this decision\\, but rather someone deciding for him\\, what gets the job done the quickest and the job was to get Ellie on her path to revenge.\r\rIf there was no Last of Us 1\\, this would have gotten a better score from me\\, but knowing the characters\\, I don't think they made the choices they should have made based on the previous game.\r\rDina\\, in my opinion is the best character out of all of them. She is the one making the most sensible choices\\, the one that fit her the most. Maybe because I never knew her before the first one\\, but I also didn't know Abby.\r\rThis game would have been better as a standalone game\\, and not as a continuation of the first Last of Us.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
