Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Not only is there very little character development\\, most characters were bland or completely useless. Coupled with cheesy lines\\, boring dialogue and glaring plot holes\\, it seems clear that Disney is going to run this franchise into the ground quite soon. Overall experience makes you feel like they're out of ideas. You're better off just rewatching The Force Awakens.","true":true}
