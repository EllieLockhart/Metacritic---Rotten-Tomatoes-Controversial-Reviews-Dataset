Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney presents \\\"Marvel's Star Wars.\\\" Stunning visuals and impressive lightsaber duels do little to help this movie that is plagued by humor that saps the drama from even the best of scenes. Interesting characters and plots from episode VII are put down before reaching their climax.\\n\\nLuke's growth in episodes IV-VI is entirely forgotten. Instead\\, we are presented with a Luke Skywalker that hardly resembles the original and who seems to do everything possible to tarnish his memory. Finn\\, yet again\\, proves to be a character that does more harm than good. The sole survivor of this holocaust of any interesting character is Kylo Ren\\, yet he is not enough to carry this film on his shoulders. The plot holes (see: cruiser lightspeed jump) are numerous\\, and I left the film with a solemn promise to myself to avoid the future star wars iterations in theatres.","true":true}
