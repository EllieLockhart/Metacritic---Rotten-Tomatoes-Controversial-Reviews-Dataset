Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the subplots feeling kind of unnecessary\\, I think I enjoyed this more than TFA\\, and found it emotionally richer. Loved the Kylo Ren\/Rey scenes\\, which had a mind-blowingly great twist on the ol' shot-reverse-shot. Of course there were a couple of contrived action sequences (something the Star Wars movies do on a regular basis)\\, but there were more surprises\\, some fucking gorgeous imagery\\, and I really appreciated the killing of many sacred cows. To carve your own future\\, you really do need to silence the ghosts of the past. That final scene was brilliant in that sense.","true":true}
