Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Great gameplay\\, many new things implemented\\, excellent graphics at the top of the generation\\, excellent music and let's talk about the history\\, it is good but determined to do certain better things\\, for example the path that Joel had to record to be killed had many conveniences\\, stories like the way of trusting unknown people\\, I think these details have had an improved improvement thatGreat gameplay\\, many new things implemented\\, excellent graphics at the top of the generation\\, excellent music and let's talk about the history\\, it is good but determined to do certain better things\\, for example the path that Joel had to record to be killed had many conveniences\\, stories like the way of trusting unknown people\\, I think these details have had an improved improvement that Joel would not drop his weapons and point to Abby and her people and ask them what they do there\\, this would have given him more realism since we recorded that Joel was a hunter and a smuggler For what I had a lot of experience in these things\\, the death they gave me was not disliked but the way it was reached. After that I liked everything\\, I feel that it goes a little over the issue of inclusion\\, there are many people with different gender preferences in the game and this is what you can know if you listen to the conversations and read some texts that you collect. I am not saying that this is bad\\, but in reality there are not many people like that\\, 1 person out of 100 has different and putting so many takes away realism. Well\\, the game I recommend 100%\\, they have to play it so they will feel more empathy with the characters\\, there will be strong moments in which they will feel frustrated\\, sad and confused by what I recommend to stop\\, similar and then continue. They will not play any game\\, because it treats the facts in a very crude and realistic way\\, if I could give it an evaluation it would put a 9.4 \/ 10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
