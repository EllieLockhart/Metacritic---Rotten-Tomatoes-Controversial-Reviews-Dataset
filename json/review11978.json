Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely adore this movie; after coming out of the theater I didn't know what to think but after processing it I have come to love The Last Jedi. It took risks and MOST of them paid off for me\\, I have issues with a few of the plot points. Kylo was probably my favorite part of this film\\, his development was amazing and Adam Driver's performance was outstanding.","true":true}
