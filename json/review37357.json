Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The poorest writing ever in a Star Wars film. Rose is the most annoying\\, pointless character ever\\, her stopping Finn's sacrifice (thereby sentencing everyone else to die if this film had any logic) was the dumbest thing I have ever seen in Star Wars. Leia's Mary Poppins moment is a disgrace. Luke criminally under-utilized... need I go on.\\n\\nThis movie killed Star Wars. I'm not even a hardcore fan\\, just someone who expects movies to be well-written. Case in point\\, I thought Rogue One was very well made. But this was just so inept that if it was not called \\\"Star Wars\\\" people would not ignore how bad this was.\\n\\nThe real story here is how\/why these movie critics can give this movie a 90%+ rating; either they are being rewarded by Disney (not necessarily with money) or they are idiots. Either way the system is totally rotten.","true":true}
