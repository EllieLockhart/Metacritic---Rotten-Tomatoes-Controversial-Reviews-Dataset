Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It didn't explain any of the questions people had after watching Episode 7\\, and basically the new director canned a lot of plot lines and replaced them with social justice and anti-capitalism scenes that didn't further the plot and were pointless. I saw the movie 4 days ago and it still doesn't make sense.","true":true}
