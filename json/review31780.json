Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So very disappointed with this movie. Why? The plot was dreadful\\, aspects were so unoriginal - Leia flying through space\\, Luke ducking under Kylo\u0092s lightsaber - plus the way Luke was treated was abominable. I love the character\\, he represents everything great about modern movies and heroism\\, and yet he was treated like a pathetic old man in this film. If I was Mark Hamill\\, I think I would have refused to play this part! Finally\\, Snoke was killed in such an easy way\\, it beggared belief. What exactly is there to look forward to in the next movie?","true":true}
