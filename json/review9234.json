Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. If you want to know how to maintain a legacy whilst doing something new\\, that also touches and connects with audiences\\, see Blade Runner 2049.\\n\\nIf you want to ruin a franchise\\, destroy the legacy of older characters\\, use weak and disconnected young characters\\, if you want to bore people to death with special effects and jokes that don't make people laugh. Make a film like this. Just the worst film I've ever seen in terms of reality vs required expectation.\\n\\nFor how to do a Star Wars movie right in this day and age\\, see Rogue One.\\n\\nAny critic who is not a moron should be tearing this to shreds. The world has gone mad. I guess the critics got paid off by Disney from all the money from the moron special effects loving masses.","true":true}
