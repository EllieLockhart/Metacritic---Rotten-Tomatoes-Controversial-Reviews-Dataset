Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. So many plot holes\\, inappropriate timing of unfunny humor\\, shafted character arcs\\, nonsensical pacing\\, and worst of all so many boring scenes.  Lukes character was absolutely butchered. The greatest hero in the entire galaxy tries to kill his nephew for thinking bad things? The guy who tried to save his father who had already wiped out the entire jedi order and served the empire for years? Bravo\\, Johnson. I guess it's nice that Luke is enough of a big guy to drink some alien testicle milk straight from the source. Always wanted to see that in star wars. But hey\\, that wasn't worse than how they dropped Reys character arc faster than the value of bitcoin. You had a great plot there with Rey being conflicted and possibly tempted by the dark side\\, but NOPE. Just a few minutes later and suddenly she's back to being 10 times the mary sue she had ever been before. And the spaceball-tier slapstick\\, holy shit. That was extremely painful to watch\\, I couldn't believe it when a character got thrown about or smacked around  like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Nothing made me laugh more than Super Leia though. I guess that was pretty serious for you\\, but I could barely hold back my laughter the entire time. 0\/10 you didn't even try. ISHYGDDT ever again. Screw Rian Johnson and Screw disney.","true":true}
