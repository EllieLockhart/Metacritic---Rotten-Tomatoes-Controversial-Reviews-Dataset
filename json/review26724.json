Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok. This wasn't the best Star Wars movie. And by no means was it the worst. I did not know what to think when I saw it initially. After the second viewing\\, I had a blast. It is however far from perfect. It suffers from pacing issues\\, a major story arc that probably didn't need to be in the movie\\, and some plot points that were a little sketchy. \\n I loved how the movie took my theories and preconceived notions and took them down completely different paths. Some of the scenes are absolutely stunning. I see the criticisms\\, but I had just way to much fun with this movie to give it near a negative rating.","true":true}
