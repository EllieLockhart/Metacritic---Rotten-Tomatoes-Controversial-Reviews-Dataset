Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The greatest sci-fi movie hero of all time receives the worst send-off of all time. Waited 35 years to see Luke on screen doing... something... something other than moaning. His highlight: performing a David Copperfield magic trick? Mark Hamill lost all that weight for nothing! Thanks a bunch\\, Rian.","true":true}
