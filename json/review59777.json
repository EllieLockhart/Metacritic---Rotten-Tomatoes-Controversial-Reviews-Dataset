Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a disaster\\, if there wasn't a TLOU .. it would be a huge game with a story problem (as u all know by now) ... but\\, you spend a lot of time building some of the best characters in games history\\, we fell in love with Joel and Ellie .. then in this garbage we see them get out of character\\, it doesn't even make sense ! i don't give a damn about Abby\\, but i don't accept for a second to harm the main character of the 1st game\\, it's ridiculous\\, unacceptable and unfair ... and then youuuuuuuu make me do it ?! how the hell am i supposed to react ? i'm not even SAD\\, i'm MAD ! this game is an insult to TLOU and to the reputation of ND and Sony ! DEFINITELY NOT BUYING THIS CRAPPY GAME\r\rAnother thing\\, the gameplay is very good .... just to be fair !! not that it matters !!!!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
