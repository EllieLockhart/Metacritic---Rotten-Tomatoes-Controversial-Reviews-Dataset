Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a horrible Star Wars movie. It would be even worst stand alone movie. There is nothing redeemable about it.  My take from this movie is that writer\/director does not like stars wars and hates male heros in movies. They've succeeded in humiliating every male character while uplifting every female characters. Push the \\\"Rich people are bad\\\" narrative down the audiences throats didn't help either. There are just a few movies that I'll hated more than this one and I will not pay to see another Star Wars movie ever again.","true":true}
