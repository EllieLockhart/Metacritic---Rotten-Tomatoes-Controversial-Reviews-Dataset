Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave this film a shot. It was unfortunate that they gave a guy like Rian Johnson so much creative power in the middle of a 9 episode story arc...  It's also unfortunate that JJ setup excitement and expectations only to have Rian actually write something to diffuse any kind of excitement and expectations. I have never hated a film as much as I hate this one. It was so bad\\, calling it crap isn't enough.","true":true}
