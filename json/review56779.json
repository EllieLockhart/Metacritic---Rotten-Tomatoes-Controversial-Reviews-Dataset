{"101487":177655,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-10-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only positive of this movie is how beautiful each shot is. A more in-depth look peels back the pretty wrapping to reveal the heaping trash compactor beneath. The continuity of this film is that there isn't any continuity. Lucasfilm would be better served by either retconning this film or pretending it never happen\\, much like Star Trek Beyond did with Into Darkness. Poor storytelling and horribly-written characters make this movie fall flat. The faceplant isn't complete without the complete dismissal or denial of logic\\, science\\, character arc\\, or what came before. In the hopes of subverting expectations\\, Rian Johnson (the director) crafted elements that broke the canon of the entire Star Wars universe. Many have come out in defense of some choices\\, saying they are explained away in TLJ novel--if it's not apparent to movie-goers\\, the people who fund the movie\\, then it's a moot point. Not everyone who watches the film will go out and buy the novel\\, so the excuse is just that\\, an excuse. \\n\\nThe subplot underpinning the movie? unravels at its culmination\\, as the duo's sidequest\\, Finn and Rose\\, does not accomplish what they set out to do. Worse\\, the quest ends in a manner that both Finn and Rose profess wouldn't work. Finn had potential in the end\\, and of all the characters that carried over from The Force Awakens\\, his was presented the best. Others did not get away unscathed as they suffered from emasculating counterparts.\\n\\nThe female characters in this movie were atrociously written and give the viewer no cause to root or care for them. Screen time for each turned into a modern\\, politically-motivated moment to emphasize the personal beliefs of the crafters rather than constructing a grand narrative worthy of the Star Wars title. Unfortunately for women everywhere\\, they do not have heroes to look up to from this movie\\, as all women were shown to be incompetent. Even the heroes of the OT era did not come away unscathed. \\n\\nIf you are excited to see this film\\, you may enter with high hopes\\, but this is where franchises\\, childhood dreams\\, and heroes go to die. The art of subversion is lost due to Rian Johnson's impotent writing skills. The entire movie is set up to make viewers disregard all that has come before\\, to forget the past and forge ahead anew\\, only to turn around and hand you the very things it promised not to deliver. When all is in ashes\\,  and the emptiness of the experience resonates\\, you will realize how utterly The Last Jedi fails. Save your money and your heartache; rent\\, don't buy.","true":true}
