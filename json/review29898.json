Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rotten Tomatoes has completely frozen the audience review score. It's mathematically impossible to remain at 49%. The average should be in the 30's at this point. This site has proven to be a complete joke and has exposed itself as the scam it really is. THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE. No amount of \\\"positive\\\" media coverage or bought off critics can change this fact. TLJ is an abomination to Star Wars and may have irreparably destroyed the franchise. I don't know what's more upsetting: the fact that Rian Johnson wrote such an incoherent\\, atrocious script or that enablers at Disney allowed him to get away with it.","true":true}
