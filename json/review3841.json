Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bitterly disappointing. Threw away everything jj Abraham's tee'd up. Full of plot holes\\, rug pulls and terrible humour. Did not care about a single character\\, zero stakes and blatant merchandise plugs. Hard to see how this will be redeemed :(","true":true}
