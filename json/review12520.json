Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't begin to explain how disappointed I was leaving the theatre after watching this trash.  I loved Johnson's previous work\\, especially Looper\\, so I was really looking forward to a competently told\/directed Star Wars adventure but this was not it... Terrible plot\\, pacing\\, character choices\\, development (or lack thereof).","true":true}
