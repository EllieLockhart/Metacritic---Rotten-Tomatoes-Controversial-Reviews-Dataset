The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Positive points : This game certainly pushes the limits of graphics in the previous generation and might also give competition to the next gen games that are gonna come out with the release of ps5\\, the level of detail in acting and audio is one of the best I've ever seen\\, plus the gameplay has also improved drastically even though the basics of the gameplay is still that of its predecessor.\rNegative points : The story is an edgy piece of crap trying to shout \\\"Oh look how different the story is\\, look what a piece of art this is\\, look we killed the main character in the first 2 hours of the gameplay and then made you play as his killer for more than 10 hours in order to have some sympathy for Abby and waste your time in the process\\\" throughout the whole game. Personally\\, I like sad and grim stories in movies\\, tv shows\\, games\\, books etc. and most of the things i've seen tends to work perfectly on an emotional level\\, but this game seems to have done the opposite despite being a sad story. Throughout the game\\, i felt no emotional attachment to the game after Joel's death as I had literally no control over the events occuring in the gameplay or the cut scenes whatsoever(especially the end)\\, yet the game constantly tries to show me how bad the decisions i made by killing hundreds of NPCs Humans and dogs were even though I killed them all because i had no choice over the actions while playing as Ellie. It feels like the writers of the Lou2 tried to shove their own ideas and thoughts while at the same time scrapping everything the first game was built on. Games are supposed to be fun even if the story is sad\\, the first part was extremely sad\\, but it was still a fun game as the chemistry between Joel and Ellie was so intriguing\\, and the audience wanted to know what more will happen to both of their relationship\\, the cure\\, the fireflies and other major parts. Scrapping the whole game\\, killing Joel early on in the game\\, and making the previous characters naturally unlikeable just for the sake of establishing new bland characters seems like a pretty goddamn dumb idea to me\\, because clearly it didn't work with the majority of the Lou fan base\\, not to mention the game was way too lengthy too. If anyone is going into this game without playing the first part\\, you might like it man but for someone who had waited for over 7 years for this\\, I feel thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied with the final product. So much for a generic revenge plot\\, holy **** Neil\/Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
