Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a movie about failure and war. It\u2019s unpredictable and undeniably one of my favorites. I don\u2019t understand the hate towards this movie. It pays homage to the two previous trilogies and turns an unexpected corner developing a truly great villain. If you are mad about the purple haired admiral not telling Poe her plan. That\u2019s because he was untrustworthy and went behind her back and made things worse. He learns his lesson in the end. 2nd best Star Wars flick!","true":true}
