Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why did Luke give up and why have jokes in a darker movie and what was the point of this movie\\, leia Should have had a ending of the character unless you do cgi and and phasma should have had a better screen play . Just everything was to much or to stupid. Kinda sad when I give a better review on my little ponys and I hate my little ponys.... thank you for the great movie.","true":true}
