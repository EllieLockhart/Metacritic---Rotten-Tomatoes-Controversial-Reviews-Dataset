Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really don't understand why this game is getting so much hate (Review bombing apparently). The game was beautiful. The only reason I give it a 9\/10 Instead of a 10 is because of the last 2ish hours\\, where you leave Dina and JJ and go back for your last chance at revenge. I get why Ellie did it\\, she needed to reach that point of full on revenge to realize that it would bring nothing but more suffering and sadness. I just wish she would have stayed with baby momma lol. It showed that the people in this world were all dealing with the same struggles as each other. Its a post apocalyptic world\\, did people really think Joel wouldn't die? He killed a hospital full of fireflies in pt.1 and no one that there would be repercussions? Lol I loved the first one so much and I think I loved this one just as much. I didn't like playing as Abby at first\\, especially the first like hour or so\\, but by the end I saw her and Ellie as equals. Everyone in this world is fighting for something\\, and the mirroring of their stories was done perfectly. I don't want a 3rd game though lol this ended perfectly. I'm happy with the game and that's all that matters to me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
