Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie and I can not deny that I got the taste of want more from Luke in episode IX he was phenomenal but we need to move on and the film leaves us on that path being epic at various times.","true":true}
