Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This star wars may have better acting and more exciting plot points than the prequels but the few crimes it commits are high crimes indeed.  Continuing the theme of episode 7 it takes the character development of Luke and destroys it.  Luke correctly believed that Vader\\, a man with trillions of deaths to his name could be redeemed.  This is now the same Luke that believes that his young nephew that is listening to the wrong channel should be executed.  It makes no sense.\\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the movie in the theatre and it was a ton of fun\\, when I left I was left with a vast empty feeling.  The movie wasn't satisfying and the more I thought about it the worse I've felt.  I've tried hard to reconcile these feelings because it is Star Wars\\, but I've felt myself slowly slip from love\\, to like\\, to simply enjoy\\, then on to dislike\\, to now hate.  It's to the point where I may wait for Redbox to even try out episode 9.","true":true}
