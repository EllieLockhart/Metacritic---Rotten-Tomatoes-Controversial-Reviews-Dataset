Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was phenomenal.  Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, & Daisy Ridley were absolutely spot on.\\n\\nNot even these actors can overcome the atrocious writing.  Huge mistakes\\, small mistakes.  No vision in the writing or directing.  It's almost as if a pubescent troll was given the Star Wars reigns for a movie.","true":true}
