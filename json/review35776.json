Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is fantastic. It goes to new places brilliantly\\, and brings familiarity with finesse. Fantastic performances and excellently directed. This is the most ambitious Star Wars film to date and it pays off in a big way. Not a single shot is boring\\, not a single character is archetypal\\, not a single action sequence isn't intense and enjoyable\\, not a single arc is weak or unbelievable. This is Star Wars at its best and boldest. Amazing. Simply amazing.","true":true}
