Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, the new Star Wars film is pretty bad. What's worst of all is how divergent the tone and style are from the original trilogy and even the prequels which at least maintain the both scope of grandeur and the subtlety voice from the originals (which Rogue One did very well). \\n\\nThe Force Awakens and The Last Jedi seem much more intent on TEACHING YOU A LESSON instead of telling you a good story. \\n\\nAnd beside tone and style\\, it didn't make ANY sense and tried to substitute 'events' for 'plot.' \\n\\nI suspect the 'professional' reviewers who gave this film a thumbs up also gave the new Ghostbusters film a good review. \\n\\nF.","true":true}
