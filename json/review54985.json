Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was certainly an entertaining way to spend 2.5 hours. It was extremely well-polished\\, was aesthetically stimulating\\, but overall I thought it was terrible. It feels all too disconnected from the Star Wars universe everyone knows. Felt like I was not watching a Star Wars film\\, but a Disney sci-fi space movie. Roam Johnson could have used the setups and mystery from episode VII but it was no well connected at all. I personally think this is my least favorite of the entire series; didn\u2019t answer any questions the audience had\\, plot was lazy\\, writing was not strong. ","true":true}
