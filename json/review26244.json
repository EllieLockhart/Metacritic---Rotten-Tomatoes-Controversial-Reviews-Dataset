Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why there\u2019s so much hate. As someone who found The Force Awakens to be pretty bland\\, I really liked the direction this one went in. In the end (no spoilers)\\, it\u2019s likely hard to see what exactly was accomplished. But I think that\u2019s part of the point. Not everything always works in your favor. Sometimes progress is made\\, sometimes we\u2019re impeded in our goals. Shifting minds will make for an interesting third installment\\, no doubt. ","true":true}
