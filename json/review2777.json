Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful mess of a movie! Another familiar story line. Unconvincing character development and clich\u00e9d interaction between the characters with simple\\, plagiarised dialogue. And then there are the cheesy jokes which ruin the atmosphere of the movie on top of some cringe-worthy scenes! There are critical errors beneath the shiny polished exterior!","true":true}
