Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal! It was an amazing movie that continued the wonderful story of Luke\\, Leia\\, Ray\\, Finn\\, and all of our other favourite Star Wars characters. There were nearly countless easter eggs\\, metaphors\\, and hidden agendas. All together a wonderful work of art.","true":true}
