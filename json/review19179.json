Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's kind of wasting money and time to watch a movie merely titled as Star Wars. It's very very disappointing as a sequel\\, the director and writer simply ignored the plot in episode VII and tricked the audience for fun. I feel a great darkness of Disney\\, the money empire will continually buy every good franchise then ruin them. Like EA did in game industry.","true":true}
