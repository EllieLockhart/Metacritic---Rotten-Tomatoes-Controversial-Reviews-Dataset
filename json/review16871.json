Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In terms of theme and character development\\, this is one of the best in the franchise\\, but there are some technical tropes and issues with plot that are par for the course with Star Wars films. Overall\\, the travesty that is the Rise of Skywalker makes the Last Jedi look like a masterpiece; the fanboy hate against Last Jedi turns out to be BS. With the benefit of hindsight\\, the trilogy would have been better off staying the course that Last Jedi sets\\, but Disney capitulated.","true":true}
