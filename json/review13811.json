Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found this one ok\\, but expected better. The film does stretch on a bit and the rose character and story ark was not great. I'm glad they decided to do more with the force use in this. It is a bit of a risk \\, but a risk i think pays off and there's quite a few really good scene's i enjoyed . However there's quite a few plot hole's and decisions in this that annoyed me.","true":true}
