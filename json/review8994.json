Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the reviews I have read it seems most people are upset that it did not do the original 3 justice and let down all the die hard fans... because they did not like the fact that this movies story did not follow their version of the story\/ how they hoped it would play out. Much like in the film\\, everyone saw their plan going one way\\, but irrational decisions lead to failure after failure. Let all the people involved in creating the film tell you a story\\, and check your preconceived notions at the door. I would give the movie between an 85-90% but I'm giving it 5 stars to balance out the shills that gave it a 1\/2 star \\\"because it didn't play out exactly how I wanted it to in my head!!!!\\\"","true":true}
