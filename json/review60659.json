Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is gonna be my honest review about the Last of Us Part 2. I will start by saying I love the first game\\, it's probably in my top 3 of all time. What made that game so great? The characters and the journey of the story.\rSo when you already kill the main character of the first game in the first 2h of the game\\, that's really hard to take in. I just want to be clear on something: I don't have a problem with Joel dying\\, but I have a problem with how it was executed. It was just so unrealistic and stupid and something Joel & Tommy never would have done. That really put a damper on me liking the game. The problem in itself is that ND lied about the game in the trailers. Nothing was indicating Joel was dying in the first couple of hours and I'm gonna guess 90 % would have wanted a story\/journey with Joel and Ellie again. The positive things about this game is of course the graphics\\, amazing AI and great combat. But what does that do when after 2 hours of the game and u don't feel engaged in the story anymore? So I did play it\\, but I never really enjoyed it. The fact that you have to play as Joel's killer in half the game also made me seriously consider putting the controller down. This is ND weakest game to date and they have to seriously do something special to hook me the way they have done before as I won't really trust what they will put in the trailers of their next game\\, whatever that is.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
