Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Finally a woman who is a Jedi and we also got to see a side of Leia that we knew was always there. I loved the parallels: Snoke trying to convince Rey of joining the Dark Side just as Darth Sidious tried to make Luke join it. I also like the fact that Rey's training was similar to Luke's. Apart from all that\\, each character has their own storyline and they all combine in a wonderful way. Adding on\\, all the new creatures were awesome! Definitely recommend it. :)","true":true}
