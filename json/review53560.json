Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent film! Rian Johnson delievers the unexpected the Star Wars movie we didn't deserve\\, but the one we needed! A wonderful addition to the saga\\, but just as good as a stand alone film. Beautiful cinematography\\, special effects\\, and some very memorable moments! This film breathes new life into the Star Wars franchise. Is definitely worth watching a second\\, third or hundred times!","true":true}
