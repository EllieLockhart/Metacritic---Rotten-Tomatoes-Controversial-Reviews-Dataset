Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor was cringeworthy (thought I was watching a bad Star Wars parody)\\, plot was ridiculous (The Resistance basically runs out of gas and 99% of them die in the process)\\, all TFA questions are rejected and thrown off a cliff and the worst part is they did Like dirty. Could care less about Episode 9. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
