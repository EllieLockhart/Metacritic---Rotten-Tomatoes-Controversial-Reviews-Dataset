Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I too am not a bot.   I saw this movie opening night and have given it two weeks to ponder and think before doing my review.   It's great if you are a person that enjoyed this movie.  I don't pretend to know your thoughts\\, and reasons -- so please don't be arrogant to think you know why I didn't like it ( and many others didn't also).\\n\\nThis movie pretends to be complex and full of surprises.  But instead I see it as lazy and condescending.  It wants to tell you that life is shades of gray\\, but then paints certain characters in a very black and white manner.  In previous movies\\, Star Wars made you smile and laugh from character interaction and dialog.  This movie seems to think that comedy must be forced and over the top. All of this is cringe worthy.\\n\\nThe main story is not at all interesting\\, and the side adventure is not needed and only serves as a way to paint certain people in a stereotypical manner.  \\n\\nI am especially saddened by the way that Luke was treated in this movie. I didn't have a fan theory about what happened to him\\, but expected him to be treated with respect and in the way that pays tribute to his previous adventures.  \\n\\nI give this movie 1\/2 star.  The visuals and music by John Williams were first rate.   In no way am I excited or pondering episode 9.  I was 12 when the IV came out\\, and for the first time in 40 years am not excited about this franchise.","true":true}
