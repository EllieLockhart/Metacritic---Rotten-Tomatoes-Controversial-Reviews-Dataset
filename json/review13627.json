Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If EpVII was a return to the \\\"feel\\\" of the original trilogy\\, EpVIII is a big step towards the \\\"feel\\\" of the prequels.  Cheap gags for laughs (that aren't funny) that ruin serious moments\\, boring plot elements\\, completely unnecessary side quests\\, forced romance\\, characters wasted due to untimely demise\\, etc\\, etc.  I won't go into spoiler talk\\, but this is definitely a movie that's not worth seeing in the theater.  The space battles (not the low-speed \\\"chase\\\" lol) are excellent\\, as is the Kylo\/Rey lightsaber fight\\, but you will want to be able to skip much of this movie.  Buy it on Amazon or blue ray next year.","true":true}
