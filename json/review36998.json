Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was so unlike every Star Wars film in that it was so unfaithful and contradictory to the main characters\\, morals\\, plot-lines and story arcs of all 7 movies before it--especially Luke's--that it turned my lifelong-fan husband into a hater. He showed me all the films and made me a fan\\, as he WAS planning on doing with our children... before he saw this film. What I dislike most about--and why I'm posting-- it is that it has  shocked\\,depressed and then angered him and turned him away from something that has been so very passionately important to him for almost his entire life. I hope Disney understands the danger they are in when they slap the faces of millions lifelong fans that have spent hard-earned money all their lives on the franchise into angry people who swear off Star Wars for life now. Before he saw this movie\\, I would have bet every cent I own that my husband would always love Star Wars\\, collected the toys and show all the movies to everyone he knew that never saw them. This movie has stunningly proved me so wrong.","true":true}
