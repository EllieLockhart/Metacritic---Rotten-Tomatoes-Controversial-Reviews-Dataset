Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited 30 years to see what happened to Luke Skywalker and was not expecting a bad comedy of a film when the time came. Some are saying haters of the last Jedi are missing the point of the film. No. We get it. It's not that complicated. But the same result could've been achieved with a but more fan service.","true":true}
