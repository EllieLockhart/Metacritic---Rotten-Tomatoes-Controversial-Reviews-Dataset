Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I seriously LOVED the game. Don't let anyone fool you. Of course you may not like the game\\, like some people did with the first one\\, but that doesn't mean that it's bad. Let me tell you otherwise: the game is a masterpiece. I'd like to say a thing or two about the trolls on here. did you know that the vast majority of player ratings were posted a few hours (if not directly) after the gameI seriously LOVED the game.

I'd like to say a thing or two about the trolls on here. did you know that the vast majority of player ratings were posted a few hours (if not directly) after the game was released. Which means they didn't play it! So don't trust these haters (I'm not saying that those who didn't like the game are haters\\, they have the right to dislike it\\, but most ... they are hehe.\r\rNeil Druckman said from the beginning that TLOU 2 was a story about revenge so if you're not ready to see ANYBODY die well... Just keep playing TLOU 1 and stop telling this game is bad\\, because it's not !\rThe story is so well written\\, I laughed\\, cried\\, got very angry and felt empty when the game ended. I got attached to some characters (abby) which I never thought I would attach myself one day. All this because despite the fact that I was very angry\\, I kept an open mind and I trusted Neil and his team. This game makes you feel something\\, and just for that it deserve wayyy more than what trolls are saying.\rI mean\\, of course some people didn't like the story\\, which is completely fine\\, everyone can have their opinion. But most of them are just mad that the game is \\\"SJW\\\" (which is not.. Ellie is a lesbian\\, ok\\, but NEVER in a thousand years do you see them having sex or anything like that\\, it's smooth and very innocent\\, it's not \\\"pushed down your throat\\\" like I've seen some people say.)\r\rNow I'd like to talk about the gameplay. It hasn't changed that much from TLOU 1 (apart from the dodge button) but I like this one better: you feel the tension more\\, you can feel just with the fights that this game is way more mature from the first. It is way more slow\\, by that I mean that it's harder to aim right\\, you feel that Ellie is more weak and has less experience that Joel.  (maybe it's just me\\, I don't know)\r\rOh I know let's talk about the music ! I loved that one too\\, but it's too bad that it's less present from the first one. Santaollala did a very good job !\r\rI'd like to go more in depth with the story but I don't want to give away any spoilers\\, but let me just say one thing: Game of the year.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
