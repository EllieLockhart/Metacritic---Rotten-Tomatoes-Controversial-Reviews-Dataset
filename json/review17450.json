Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie and I the movie was an absolute MESS. I am giving this movie a half a star just because it ruined the Starwars franchise. The plot was so horrible\\, the dialogue was shit\\, they ruined lukes character and they made another giant introduction to the next film. Episode 9 is going to be bloated and there's nothing that's going to interest me from watching Episode 9. Rian Johnson and the writers really screwed this one up BIG TIME!","true":true}
