Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed to see Luke die of course\\, Snoke turned out to be a nobody and no back story on who the hell he was. Leia surives a ship blowing up flies into space yet she is ok\\, but look dies becuase he is not strong enough to project himself across space. Stupid.","true":true}
