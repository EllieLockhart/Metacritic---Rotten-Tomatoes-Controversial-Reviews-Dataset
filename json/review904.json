Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An instant classic! Rian Johnson takes the Star Wars saga in fresh and interesting new directions while avoiding the tired\\, formulaic rehash that made The Force Awakens such a disappointing movie. Does justice to the original vision of Star Wars while setting us up for a whole new generation of heroes and villains. Can't recommend it highly enough!","true":true}
