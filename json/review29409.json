Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did take risks but most fell flat with little substance sustaining them.  This whole movie placates a myriad of social justice groups\\, and it doesn't even do it very well.  It reinforces a female agenda by making every male in the movie look incompetent\\, foolish\\, and dumb.  \\nIt deconstructs beloved heroes for no apparent reason.  It pokes fun at and marginalizes a passionate fan base in an arrogant attempt  to pretend it is progressive\\, current \\, and smart.","true":true}
