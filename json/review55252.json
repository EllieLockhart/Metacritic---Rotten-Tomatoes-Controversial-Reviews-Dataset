Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"kinda feels like the Lost TV show. lots of buildup to not much of anything. All the mysteries and setups from Force Awakens are a total letdown. apparently they did it on purpose to claim some sort of artsy idea of defying expectations\\, which is more LIKELY a fancy industry term for\\, having no idea how to write an interesting conclusion for those set ups so lets try and squeeze some really weak humor out of them. \\nReally stupid leaders on both side making really stupid decisions makes you wonder how anybody follows any of them. \\nCritic rating of 91% suggests that they were really hoping for a let down of a movie and got exactly what they wanted. HAvent been this DISAPPOINTED in a movie since phantom menace.","true":true}
