Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a good movie\\, judged only on its own merits - in order of severity\\, it's flaws are sloppy writing\\, poor direction\\, weak pacing.\\n\\nJudged as a Star Wars movie\\, this is easily one of the worst of the entire franchise. It's nonsensical and completely inconsistent in tone and plot with everything that came become. In the same way that Disney's \\\"Hobbit\\\" movies came a distant\\, sloppy second to the outstanding Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\, the Last Jedi is an embarrassment to the franchise and a slap in the face for the fans.\\n\\nIgnore the clueless\\, possibly-bought-and-paid-for critical reviews. This is a mediocre movie at best.","true":true}
