Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of fun and an interesting take on how people not named Skywalker connect with The Force. The scenes in the casino are lame and I wanted to learn more about Snoke's backstory\\, but otherwise it's a great movie.","true":true}
