Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Regardless of whether this keeps in line with Star Wars lore\\, as a movie it's poor. The plot is so full of holes it's stupid. It's overly long\\, and the whole Casino scenes are a complete waste of time. It's poorly written and edited.","true":true}
