Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as if the writers had never seen the Original Star Wars Trilogy. \\n\\nLuke Skywalker\\, who saw good in Mr Evil Darth Vader\\, gets a whiff of dark side in his best friend and twin sister's son\\, his very nephew\\, and attempted to kill him. Then went into seclusion like a coward. Then killed him off.\\n\\nWhat a crappy conclusion for Luke Skywalker.\\n\\n\\nI was there opening day to see this film\\, as well as many other Star Wars Films\\, but this one has told me that \\\"OLD\\\" fans of Star Wars can F*** OFF by Disney.","true":true}
