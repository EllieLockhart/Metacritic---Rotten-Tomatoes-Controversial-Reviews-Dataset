Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's so many people already complaining about the humor aspects to the movie who don't even begin to realize why they're in there to begin with. The movie as a whole is extremely dark as it delves deeper into Kylo\\, Luke and Rey. The light hearted moments were needed and welcomed to give the darker moments more of a raw impact that's just writing 101. Too many people out there nowadays just want what they think is best\\, but if they had it EXACTLY\\, their way only they would enjoy it. \\nThe Last Jedi did everything it needed to and more\\, we finally got to see how powerful Luke was\\, we got constant carpet pulled from under our feet moments\\, Leia used the force finally\\, Rey and Kylo teamed up briefly from a bad ass scene. Honestly there's so much good to be writing about this movie that my fingers would cramp. I just felt the need to make this review\\, because people nowadays are so\\, well childish ironically enough. They hate the slightest thing and over dramatize it without even thinking about why it's there. The comedy isn't Jar Jar levels of bad\\, it's brief bits in there to get the audience to relax again. People forget movies are stories\\, they have to set moods and be able to surprise us\\, impact us\\, and leave us wanting more. I'll be seeing his movie at least once more in theaters and I bet most of the naysayers will too.","true":true}
