Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this \\\"franchise\\\" can be burried now.  similar to what Alien Covenant was for the Alien \\\"franchise\\\" this movie destroys all characters and character development from the old movies\\, brings in purple haired SJW\u00b4s in space and is a blatant spit in the face of anyone just loving the original series. I cant believe i\u00b4m saying this but the prequels look like artworks now. at least they didnt killed of Star Wars. Avoid. at. all. cost. Ah yes the music and vistas were great. But same was true for Alien Covenant or any other high budget movie nowdays.","true":true}
