Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Una pelicula muy incomprendida por parte de los fans\\, quienes quieren ver una pelicula hecha a su gusto y teor\u00edas. Buena pelicula falla con la poca aparici\u00f3n de Luke pero lo demas bien\\, yo opino que merece ser mejor tratada y que los fans se den cuenta de que George Lucas ya no es mas el director de Star Wars\\, y acepten a las nuevas generaciones innovadoras\\, menos apegadas y  mas futuristas.","true":false}
