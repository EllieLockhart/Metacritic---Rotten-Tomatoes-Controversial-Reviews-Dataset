Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never left the theater after seeing a star wars movie so disappointed in my life.  I have a 4 month old boy and I have been counting down the days until I am able to show him star wars\\, one of my most beloved stories.  What they've done to these characters in a single movie has greatly lessened my anticipation  and made me dread what else they will ruin for my little boy before he's old enough to see these movies.  I haven't even touched on the fact that we already found out what happens after Return of the Jedi 20 some years ago in the books\\, but they were scrapped for absolutely no reason at all.  I now consider these new sequels to be nothing more than second rate fan fiction","true":true}
