The game was extremely well written having players go on a journey as both Ellie and Abby. Ellie's story truly pulls on your heart. Players will find themselves lost in a world of horror and anger. I truly hated Abby when I started playing as her since she killed Joel\\, one of my favorite characters. By the end of playing as her\\, you come to love her and want her to succeed. The ending teaches players that revenge is not always the correct answer. Revenge cost Ellie everything she ever loved\\, almost getting her killed.\rThe game mechanics truly are amazing. Fighting is incredibly smooth and gives players a ton of options on how to play. You can run and gun or you can be stealthy in your encounters with enemies. There are intense and graphic death scenes that help players get immersed in life during the zombie apocalypse. All enemies have names so killing them will cause their friends to cry about the deaths of their friends. The game is also extremely scary filled with more then just typical jump scares. This game is a must-play for all players.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
