The game on Survival is BRUTAL\\, It's exciting and makes you come up with hundreds of new ways to play the game. If you see a user score of 0\/10 or 1\/10\\, you should best leave it ignored\\, the amount of graphical achievements\\, art direction\\, game play\\, animations\\, they're way beyond anything I've seen in gaming.\r\rThis game has surely surpassed technical leaps\\, to give it such a low score is disgraceful.\rWhile I do think the first game is better than the second one story wise\\, overall my experience in Part 2 was a lot more fun due to it's flashed out mechanics.\r\rThis story is all about moral choices in a world that is cruel and you should ask yourself....Would you personally end the cycle of revenge?\r\rJust cause the game has characters that you love\\, doesn't mean they're safe\\, nor should they be perfect as people want them to be\\, and that's the beauty of this game\\, it's real and raw with emotion.\r\rIt's a masterpiece for me\\, not meant for everyone.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
