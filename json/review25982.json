Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing will ever be as good as the first three. This one I actually fell asleep. It was visually well done and it was nice to see the characters created 40 years ago. But it is a one and done for me. It\u2019s time to put this franchise on the shelf for a good 10 years.
