Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What's missing from the Star Wars franchise since the original trilogy is any sense of vision and passion. This is the worst of all for its sheer pretentiousness and as with most of the comedy\\, the attempt to 'subvert expectations' falls flat.","true":true}
