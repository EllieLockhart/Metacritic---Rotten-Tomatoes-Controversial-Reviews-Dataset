Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As standalone movie would be great\\, as part of the saga it was just so off. Seriously Luke character didn't make any sense\\, also suddenly force users getting overpowered\\, while in previous movies they trained for years just to lift a small rock\\, now they can talk through distance and stuff.  I could go on.","true":true}
