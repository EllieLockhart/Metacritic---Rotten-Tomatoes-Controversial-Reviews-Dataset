Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was extremely disappointed in TLJ. The story with the Resistance made no sense\\, all of the tactics portrayed were based on the theory of \\\"what is the stupidest thing we can have them do now?\\\"\\, and how Luke was presented just turned my stomach. As a diehard fan of the original trilogy and having read many of the books that came after\\, I just can't accept TLJ as a Star Wars movie. It was like the Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr. If you aren't a fan of Sherlock Holmes\\, then they weren't bad movies\\, but if you are a fan\\, prepare to be disappointed. As always\\, this is all just my opinion\\, but there you have it.","true":true}
