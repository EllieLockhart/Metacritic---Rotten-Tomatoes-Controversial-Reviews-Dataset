Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie ever made. Useless subplots and too many weak characters. They could have developed Rey's background to make us care\\, but didn't. Kylo is just way too angry to be a smart villain. Basically\\, Rian Johnson and the writers have killed off everything good about Star Wars.","true":true}
