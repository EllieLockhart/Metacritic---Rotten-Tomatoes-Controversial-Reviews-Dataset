Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many Star Wars fanatics such as myself\\, I have spent most of my life watching the movies over and over again\\, reading the books in the extended universe and watching the TV shows. My love and appreciation for the Star Wars universe has only grown stronger as I have reached my 20's. It filled me with much sadness and disappointment to leave the theater Thursday night thoroughly disliking this movie. The acting was poor\\, along with the dialogue written for the actors and actresses. The story was impossible to follow at times\\, meandering around like a stray dog. I am not sure if Rian Johnson even knew what direction he wanted this movie to go. Supreme Leader Snoke was a supremely useless character\\, as was Captain Phasma. The whole codebreaker sub plot was ridiculously pointless and made the Resistance look like a bunch of hapless fools. In the end\\, I fear this could be the end of quality Star Wars movies as we know it. Although George Lucas missed the mark with the prequels\\, I dare say he could have easily produced a better movie than this last installment. I gave this a 1 and a half star rating\\, the half being a quality scene with Force Ghost Yoda and Luke\\, but it seems to me as though this movie did not deserve that scene in the slightest. Knowing Rian Johnson is heading up the new trilogy in the future\\, I fear it is truly a dark day for those of us fighting with the Rebellion. In the words of Luke Skywalker\\, \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\".","true":true}
