Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A poor exercise in deconstructing the heroic character and paragons of virtue that came before.  A shallow and transparent attempt to use the older cast as tools to use to pass off a money printing machine to a corporation\\, then be disposed of.  Kathleen Kennedy and her cabal of anti-intellectual corporate suits in her writer's room have done it again\\, created a soulless advertisement for toys\\, lead by a non-character.","true":true}
