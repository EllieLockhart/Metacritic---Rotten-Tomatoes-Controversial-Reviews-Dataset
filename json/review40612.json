Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever...  Why why why did you take this movie from JJ Abrams....  Magic Jedi books??  Changing the plot multiple times?  Breaking every rule established in previous Star Wars films?  The last Jedi milking a muppet on the beach with big ass kitties??  Is this Jedi retirement???  Is he milking Ensure from those things??  Ohh man..........  Disappointed beyond words......","true":true}
