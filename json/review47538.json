Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What's make a good movie is a the story. Once you have your story you can built around had whatever special effect or characters on it. The Last Jedi just forgot this simple rule. Who ever was in charge of the script didn't do is job. None of the new characters are interesting and the two Legends Luke and Laia look so... old and tired. So please for the next one do your homework start with the story.","true":true}
