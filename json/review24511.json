Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the backlash this movie gets comes from nostalgia. Yes this movie does have it's fair share of problems but the good stuff more than just makes up for it. Finally something new is coming from the force and it feels like a natural progression.","true":true}
