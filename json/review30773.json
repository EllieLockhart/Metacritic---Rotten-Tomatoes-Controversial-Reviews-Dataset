Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slower paced than Ep.VII. Felt a bit too lengthy and stretched out at times. But also deeper than VII. A LOT more unpredictable. With a couple of jawdropping twist-turns. And an E-P-I-C \\\"BOSSS!!!\\\" moment between a single Luke Skywalker versus the entire First Order armada of Kylo Ren. Overall\\, just what we expected\\, another fulltoos awesome fun Star Wars.\\n\\n9 out of 10. Need to see at least a couple of more times to fully absorve everything!","true":true}
