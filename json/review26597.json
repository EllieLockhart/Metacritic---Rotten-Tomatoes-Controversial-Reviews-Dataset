Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay as a standalone movie... but that doesn't make up for the fact it destroyed the Star Wars franchise; and my love of the Star Wars universe.   I use to love all the  characters from old\\, but the way Rian J. desecrates Luke's legacy... makes us all hate any reference to Skywalker or the characters of  old.  \\n\\nI don't connect with  any of the new rebels or badarses  (I found Snoke interesting... but he is gone as well).   I guess the Star War saga isn't being produced for the sci-fi fans anymore...","true":true}
