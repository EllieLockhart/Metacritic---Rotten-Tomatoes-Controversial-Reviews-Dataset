Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't see where the hate is coming from?!  There were two bad scenes.  The casino scene was not good by any means and the destruction of the bridge was terrible. You can't just kill off main characters without even the slightest bit of acknowledgement.  What did work was the acting... Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley worked so well together.  Hammil  turned in his best performance as Skywalker since ESB. I thought the pacing was great and the humor hit on the right notes.  Highly recommend it for old school fans. Prequelist will be disappointed.  Among the many things that did work with the film were be general were the space battles that were visually stunning and reminded me of the good thing about the prequels. I did not have of any sense which way this film was going to take us come out which was quite a bit different then the force awakens come out which I felt was very predictable.","true":true}
