Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie of all time. If you are a Star Wars fan\\, do not put yourself through this. If you a fan of films in general\\, you still will probably not enjoy this. Plot holes galore. Over half an hour dedicated to a stupid side plot that has no effect at all on the film and only serves to shove politics down your throat. Established characters acting totally out of character with no explanations. Horribly written new characters. A total disregard for certain things that were set up in the previous film.","true":true}
