Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank goodness it wasn?t a remake of Empire Strikes Back.  I?m happy that some of foolishness set up in The Force Awakens was resolved and thrown out.  I was happy to see the new characters introduced and I?m interested in where we go next - that is high praise.","true":true}
