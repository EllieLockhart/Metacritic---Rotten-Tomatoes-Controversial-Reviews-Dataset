Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"would have given 5 stars\\, but I wanted to see more jedi action. other than that it was a very good movie. I already knew what was going to happen because of spoilers\\, last time I do that. plenty of action and humor to keep one entertained. I'm hoping for more light sabers in episode 9","true":true}
