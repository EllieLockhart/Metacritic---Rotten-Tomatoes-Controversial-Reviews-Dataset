Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Production\\, music and certain story elements\\, but overall\\, abandoned much of what makes a Star Wars Movie 'Star Wars' I did not like the way the represented Luke\\, as he just didn't feel like the Luke that was established in the original trilogy. Many plot points also did not make sense\\, questions brought up in the Force Awakens were just brushed aside\\, leaving me\\, as well as others feeling 'empty' when leaving the theatre. After all the build up\\, a huge disappointment\\, and while Rian Johnson should take much of the blame\\, the whole Disney version of Star Wars\\, as been trending in a poor direction. We'll see if they get their act together in episode IX\\, but for many it will be too little too late.","true":true}
