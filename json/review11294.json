Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this was a very disappointing film. The plot holes\\, droped plot lines\\, out of place humor\\, and the underdevelopment of certain characters make this film not hold up yet it was somewhat enjoyable. The real problem with this film however is the complete missed opportunity to make it amazing. There were times while watching the movie where I literally laughed and the stupidity of some of the scenes. This movie will not hold up over time and eventually critics will come to realize some of the mistakes that this film made.","true":true}
