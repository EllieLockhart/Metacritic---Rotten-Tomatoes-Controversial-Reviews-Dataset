Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where the force awakens followed a new hope's structure very closely\\, the last jedi takes the foundation of empire strikes back but manages to build its own unique story while still keeping a familiar feel within the star wars universe. The themes chosen are refreshing to see not just in this series but in cinema in general. While pacing and character development for the expanding cast does have issues at time\\, the overall narrative will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. While being the middle movie of a trilogy\\, the last jedi manages to escape the common pitfuls similar movies face wrapping up the 2nd of a 3 part story and frankly would be a satisfying end to the core story of star wars all together.","true":true}
