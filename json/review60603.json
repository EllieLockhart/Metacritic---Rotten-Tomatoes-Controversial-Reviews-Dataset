Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Everyone forgot what happened to Ellie at the Chapter Winter in the first game. That season changed her and took away a lot of her innocence and love. The story for Part II isn\u2019t perfect and I didn\u2019t like playing as Abby. Ellie is the same character from Part I she lost her innocence before that game even ended. Joel has had to deal with his lie all this time and Ellie knew it as seen in a flashback from the trailer for a second and in gameplay. Ellie\u2019s worst fear was ending up alone and... it happened. I get the split liking and disliking of this game and this is the very first game review I\u2019ve ever posted on Metacritic but I have to say I enjoyed what I witnessed but it wasn\u2019t perfect\\, but still a good game and good story just not fantastic. And I\u2019ve played the **** out of Part I I\u2019m not even exaggerating when I say I\u2019ve played Part I 16 times and I played it 2 more times in a span of 2 months before Part II dropped. I was ready and had huge refreshes on the story. I also stayed away from the leaks but I did know how Joel died just not when and how fast he did. This is a definite should play all around\\, define your own opinion on games and media it\u2019s what we all have the ability to do. Judge this game on your own terms\\, I did.
