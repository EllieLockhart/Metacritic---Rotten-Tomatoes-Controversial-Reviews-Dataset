Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ruined Star wars. Let me start with the fact that all involved squandered so many opportunities. No ancient jedi lore\\, no real training for Rey\\, luke milks a space cow\\, Reys character gets ruined by being the child of junkie  \\, and we are supposed to buy that she would care enough about Kylo Ren to go try and save him? GTFO. Squandered the Snoke character. No back story on him AT ALL. He could have been some ancient Sith.Luke is weak\\, and they gave him a horrible death\\, almost laughable. His only fight scene\\, if you can call it that\\, is him a some stupid force hologram? Lol. Did I mention that carry Fischer was blown out to space\\, and force floated herself back to the ship\\, and lives? Lol. The vacuum of space woul have sucked her eyeballs out and her lungs would have exploded after she was frozen solid. Who the F#%^ approved this script? We get no answers\\, no cliffhanger\\, no knights of Ren\\, no lightsaber fights. I could go on and on. Pure crap Disney\\, and Rian...you're a hack.","true":true}
