Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage.  Critic score 91%????  I smell some dirty money.\\nReally though\\, terrible writing\\, pointless plot arcs\\, and pointless characters. The movie builds you up thinking something is important and then suddenly shows everything they had been building up is meaningless.  Rey has yet to face a real challenge the whole movie.  Also\\, the political statements are obvious and poorly executed to the point of being sickening.  I've spent time in the military and Holdo is about the shittiest Commanding Officer you could ask for.  I won't be visiting the theater for any more Star Wars movies until they fix the franchise.","true":true}
