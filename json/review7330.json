Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 was not good and theirs no other way to put it. They diminished the Fans of this universe by ruining characters and leaving way to many plot holes.\\nRey is a horribly written character and the story is underwhelming and unbelievable.\\nThe story and writing is really what suffers here and even great visuals can't replace that.\\nThis movie is an example of why there should have never been a sequel trilogy.","true":true}
