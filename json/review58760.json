The other type are people disgusted with the graphic violence and depressing tone of the game\\, who I guess expected Nathan Drake to drop from the sky and give everyone ice cream. They're both wrong.\r\rAt the end of the day\\, this game is A LOT like the first one\\, with a lot less board carrying\\, ladder moving\\, and garbage dumpster placing and a lot more exploration\\, world\/character building and combat tactics.\r\rIts probably the most beautiful game ever made\\, and it's probably the first game I've where the slow walking speed that's usually forced in games feels appropriate; the world is just THAT dense with detail.  I found myself literally slowing down just because it felt right taking the world in at that contemplative speed.\r\rThe story\\, is brutal. Period.  In fact its miserable. If you like drama like Requiem for a Dream\\, you'll be right at home\\, but I understand why this game is too much for some people. It's realistic and it's unrelenting. LoU2 is mostly a revenge anti-fantasy and the game's story ends up being a lot about the price we pay a person hates.\r\rGame play is a lot of the same but more dynamic with less stupid puzzles to keep you stuck in small areas. Its a wider world and you have a lot more freedom to explore which has been my favorite part. The game probably changes characters and skips around in time a bit for me\\, BUT these instances more than justified themselves in the story and happen less frequently later on.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
