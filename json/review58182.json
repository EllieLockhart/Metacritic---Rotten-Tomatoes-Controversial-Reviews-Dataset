Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yick\\, what an atrocious movie.  I too created an account just so I can give a voice to what was wrong with this movie.  This was a pretty movie that had Star Wars music\\, but it was not a Star Wars movie.  The rules in that galaxy that we've come to expect no longer apply.  There is corny humor throughout and characters acting contrary to their personalities.  But\\, the most offensive part was the social commentary.  I could have done without the preaching and heavy-handed poltical issues.\\n\\nSince this movie was an obvious attempt at feminism propaganda\\, I'll discuss it by gender...spoilers follow.\\n\\nMen \\nLuke - slightly deranged\\, cranky and weak\\nPoe - impulsive\\, brash hothead\\nSnoke - weak and stupid\\nFinn - empty and cowardly\\nKylo Ren - petulant\\, moody and destructive\\nHux - a joke\\n\\nWomen\\nLeia - fearless\\, wise\\, can fly\\nHoldo - smarter than all the men\\nRey - most powerful Jedi ever\\nRose - worst character\/actor ever portrayed in any movie\\, ever\\n\\nDroids and Chewbacca - a mere prop who shared a combined total of about 5 minutes of screen time.\\n\\nNone of the intriguing questions that the Force Awakens were addressed in any satisfactory way.  Rules of space and gravity don't apply.  Jedi lore and legacy trashed.  Scenes that should've ended up on the cutting floor occupy a bulk of time.  Time wasted on pointless\\, tedious scenes that go nowhere.  Characters that annoy and spout SJW nonsense (ROSE = JAR JAR BINKS level annoying).\\n\\nReally\\, just a terrible installment of what should have been an amazing story.","true":true}
