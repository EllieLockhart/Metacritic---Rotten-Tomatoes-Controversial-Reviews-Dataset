Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, first off\\, I really liked The Last Jedi . I thought it was a good space-opera movie\\, and overall a very good blockbuster sci-fi movie. Is it perfect? No. But it's definitely far from ''bad''. I enjoyed it from start to finish but had some problems along the way. Here we go\\nFirstly\\, the returning characters were really great. John Boyega as Finn was awesome\\, Daisy as Rey was amazing\\, and overall\\, each and every one of them were very good. Characters were done very well in this movie.\\n\\nBut the best\\, I mean\\, the BEST character in this movie is the one we've all been waiting to see; Mark Hamill as Luke. He was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Mark Hamill did an amazing job in this one. might be his best performance of Luke.\\n\\nAlso\\, the movie features some really\\, REALLY great lightsaber scenes. I'm really satisfied with what I've seen. There were a lot of great action scenes in this movie and it's great.\\n\\nOther than characters\\,the movie had a lot of great wide shots and I absolutely love it. One thing's for sure\\, the movie looks beautiful. There's not a single scene in the movie that looks bland or uninteresting. Also\\, I really like the story in this movie. it's a very matured story\/premise compared to the other Star Wars stories (movies) in my opinion.\\n\\nSince I've talked a lot of good things about The Last Jedi\\, let's talk about some things that I don't like. firstly\\, there's 1 subplot (which I won't spoil) which was dragged on for too long and it took me out of the movie for a bit. It's not a major problem\\, but still..\\n\\nOne other thing that I saw is the pacing. Though I liked the movie a lot\\, the pacing were a bit too fast in some parts of the movie. I think The Force Awakens had better pacing and scenes that connect with each other.\\n\\nOverall\\,this was a very good movie. It's my 4th favorite Star Wars movie (so far).It's a fun blockbuster with some very good writing on some characters and also great cinematography & action scenes. Rian Johnson did a good job. I can't wait to see more of his works! Loved his work on Looper! (that was one of the best sci-fi of 2010s in my opinion!)","true":true}
