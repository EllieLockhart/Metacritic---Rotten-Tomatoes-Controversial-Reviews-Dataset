Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the bad reviews are people that went to the movie with too many fan theories in their heads. \\n\\nI'm one of the least harsh critics out there so I thought it was great. But I just really enjoy movies in general and especially Star Wars. \\n\\nThe movie does a lot of unexpected things so go in with an open mind and just enjoy yourself. It's a big budget movie that takes actual risks\\, which is a really cool thing to see nowadays.\\n\\nThere are definitely some glaring plot holes and a few character choices that are pretty illogical but is it really even a Star Wars movie with out those aspects?","true":true}
