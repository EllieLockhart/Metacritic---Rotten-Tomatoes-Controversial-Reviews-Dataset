Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies Ive ever seen.  Cgi is awesome\\, but EVERYTHING else  is horrible.... In my worst imagination I couldn't see Disney screw up star wars this bad.  They get the last laugh though\\, all the way to the bank.....","true":true}
