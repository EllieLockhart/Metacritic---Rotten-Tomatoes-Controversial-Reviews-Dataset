Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is just amazing! As many people are saying\\, the best star wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. It is so exciting\\, I cried and it gave me the goosebumps a couple times. There characters are so well developed\\, specially Kylo Ren\\, his arc is just perfect\\, is one of the best ones in the movie. Rey is also amazing as always and Luke\\, damn was he great\\, he just gave everything we wanted\\, from far Mark Hamill's best performance. I recommend it to everyone to go watch it\\, and can't wait to see it again myself.","true":true}
