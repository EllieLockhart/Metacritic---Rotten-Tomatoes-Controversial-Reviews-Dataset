{"101487":184157,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, if anything\\, shows just how out-of-touch the 'critics' are with reality\\, and how Rotten Tomatoes has sold it's soul and become completely unreliable as far as ratings go.\\nThe movie itself was just ok... about on par with Attack of the Clones\\, although even that movie had better story. I still enjoyed The Last Jedi better than Episode 1\\, but not by much. The movie's effects and action sequences were actually top notch\\, a huge round of applause goes out to the FX team as the visuals and use of sound were outstanding... some of the best I've seen. The main issue with this movie is the story. As good as Rian might be\\, he absolutely butchered this and went so far off track with nearly everything. There was a lot of setup done in TFA that just isn't taken advantage of or even used in TLJ. The stories that fans wanted to hear and the answers they were hoping would be there just weren't. Instead\\, it seems\\, he went for the 'last night before the term paper was due' approach. There was a large portion of the movie that was not only unnecessary\\, it actually made things much worse and many more people were killed because of it\\, but somehow that's ok because 'hey\\, we're taking a different direction with this one'. So much else is wrong with this one\\, but even so\\, I'll still see the next one because I am a true fan and I have hope that the franchise can be rescued from this debacle. After all\\, rebellions are built on hope.","true":true}
