Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'Last Jedi' KILLED TWO things:\\n\\n[1] My love of Star Wars.\\n\\n[2] Any trust I had in Rotten Tomatoes. I don't mean the critical score (thats all Disney's 'generosity') but the audience score. I read several pages of reviews and most are 1 star or less. Even including all the suspicious CAPS LOCK\\, one sentence 5 star reviews\\, its impossible for this movie to be as high as 49%.  \\nRT has lost credibility.","true":true}
