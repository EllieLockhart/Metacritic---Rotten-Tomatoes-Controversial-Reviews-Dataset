{"101487":121313,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all I'm a big star wars fan\\, but I must admit that to me Force Awakens was a mash up of everything which went before it... Secret plans carried by droid chased down by First Order\\, young potentially powerful Jedi on planet similar to Luke. I can live with those similarities. Then we have Last Jedi... I will try to do this with no spoilers but around half way through this film I was wondering why we were moving at such a slow pace. Snoke's origins are not discussed\\, and to be honest I don't yet really feel a great warming to the new characters not really sure there is much chemistry. Spoiler alert\\, well letting you know two characters still alive at the end of this movie anyhow. Right at the end of this movie Poe introduces himself to Rey... You telling me that after everything that happened in the first movie they have never met.....!? I wonder whether Disney's intention is to do background movies to give more depth so we may grow to love these movies. After all our modern Bobba Fett\\, Phasma has no real depth\\, though when you think about it Bobba Fett only had more interest than say Greedo because\\, well one he was there a little longer\\, and two we learnt more about his background during the prequals. Still massive fan of the Star Wars franchise just hope that Disney can improve on what they have done so far.","true":true}
