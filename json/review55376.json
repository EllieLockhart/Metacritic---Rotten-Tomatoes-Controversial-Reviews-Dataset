Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it!! What's with the audience hate? I loved the twists that added to the Force mythology. Some of you complained about Luke...calling him bitter and cowardly and then ignored his complete story arc. He went from a kid with big dreams\\, finding out about his father\\, dealing with dual side of the Force\\, anger at his personal losses\\, defeating the Empire\\, re-establishing a Jedi temple\\, painful awareness of his consequences of his decisions\\, rejecting\/accepting his Jedi training to a very satisfying end. Mark Hamill whether you agree or not about the story....just did his finest acting in all of the Star Wars movies. \\nI'm also a huge Star Wars fan and I don't agree with many of the people's dislike for the Finn or Rey storylines.  You also claim that there were too many inconsistencies with all the storylines...I got news for you...the original star wars movies were full of them too. Don't get me started on the Phantom Menace. Lol. The Star Wars universe\/Force is alive and under good care with Disney.","true":true}
