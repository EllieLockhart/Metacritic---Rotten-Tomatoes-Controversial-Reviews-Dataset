{"101487":170355,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-13","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi (TLJ) has to be in my top 3 Star Wars movies for a lot of reasons. Yes\\, it does have a few problems\/mistakes but TLJ always came threw with an explanation to the scene and a purpose. \\n\\nSPOILER WARNING\\n\\nLet's start with the good things \\n\\n- Amazing graphics and special effects\\, easily best in the series\\n- Incredible performances by the entire cast\\, especially by Mark Hamil (Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher (Leia).\\n- Even though there really wasn't a real light saber fight scene in this movie\\, the action and the fight scenes were very nice.\\n- Great Story\\, very clever plot (Especially the Kylo Ren and Snoke scene\\n- Overall great fun\\, intensity\\, plot\\, and characters.\\n\\nNow the downs\\, there are a few but they didn't affect my experience \\n\\n- The Leia space-waking scene was pretty silly and had me say \\\"Ok\\, what the heck\\\"\\n- All this talk about Snoke being the most powerful being ever and then he dies easily\\, but the clever plot line kept it from becoming annoying \\n-If the rebels were able to light speed through the first order ship\\, how come they didn't have the first order do the same thing to the rebels?\\n- I was expecting a dark and serious Star Wars movie\\, and this is was a little too funny for me\\, but it didn't take away from my experience \\n- Why didn't holdo just tell Poe her plan\\, they could have completely avoided the whole Finn and Rose mission.\\n\\nIgnore the bad reviews\\n\\nHonestly everyone else is pretty stupid for rating this movie low just because they don't understand a certain plot point\\, also fans shouldn't expect the movie to be a perfect masterpiece and when it's not they rate it 1\/5 stars. You guys can't think that there gonna make the movie exactly how you personally wanted it\\, to believe that is stupid. People need to learn how to enjoy a movie. Stop comparing it to the originals\\, treat every movie like its own movie\\, not what it didn't or did live up to.","true":true}
