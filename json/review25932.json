Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing can save a poorly written film. From start to finish this film was a disaster of epic proportions. Childish humor\\, wasteful plot lines \\,no real new character connections made\\, no backstories\\, sloppy sloppy directing. The acting is fine\\, driver is totally underutilized for the kind of talent he is. No trilogy is perfect\\, hopefully JJ can save the saga.(again)Only time will tell.","true":true}
