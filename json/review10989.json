Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having strong female leads\\, expectations being subverted\\, I like all of that. Most of my favorite movies have that. The issue with The Last Jedi is it has plot holes\\, bad writing and editing. If you put aside all the complaints about Luke\\, forced characters\\, Leia Poppins\\, etc\\, it still doesn't work as a movie. And it gets more evident\\, given The Force Awakens did such a good job on those terms. The Last Jedi is a movie I wouldn't watch again.","true":true}
