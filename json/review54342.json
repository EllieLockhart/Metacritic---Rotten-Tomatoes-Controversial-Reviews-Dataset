Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been so disappointed from a movie. I avoided all news\\, trailers\\, everything for this movie for the past two years\\, even leaving theatres during trailers\\, because I've seen how much trailers can ruin a movie recently. What I'm saying is I went in fresh\\, no expectations\\, no preconceived notions outside of that it was going to follow up on what I believed was a pretty good prequel (Ep. 7). \\n\\nI sat and failed to find one redeeming moment in the first hour and a half of this movie. Where you would expect character development\\, you had long panning shots of character faces\\, where you wanted plot development\\, you had short scenes of few sentences that did nothing but set up the next jump cut to another short scene with no real substance. And what the hell was with all of the \\\"comedic relief\\\"? *small spoiler* There are multiple times when entire squadrons of the rebels are being killed in front of their fellow soldiers and one of the multiple little marketable fuckers come bouncing along breaking into what should be a serious and heart wrenchinf=g scene. \\n\\nI can't believe I'm saying this\\, but DO NOT see this movie\\, its not worth the time or money.","true":true}
