Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Coming from a huge Star Wars fan this is the worst movie of them all. There was so little to enjoy from this film. People literally walked out of the theater during the film I went to and I wish I did too. ","true":true}
