Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Atrocious film\\, vacuous\\, puerile\\, nonsensical\\, nihilistic\\, feminazi PC claptrap. It's utterly unctuous to the twilight and Fifty Shades audience. Rian Johnson can't direct his way out of a paper bag. By far the worst film in the franchise\\, a feat thought impossible. Kathleen Kennedy should be fired.","true":true}
