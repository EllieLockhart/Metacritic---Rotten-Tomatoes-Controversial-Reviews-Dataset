Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The short of this is that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" severely falls short of expectations.\\nThe long is that the movie was clearly not made for an adult audience.  Instead it felt like the PG-13 rated movie was made for a much younger crowd\\, and happened to accommodate the older generation of Star Wars fans.\\nThe bad:\\nThe humor was low\\, and slapstick throughout.  The character development of Kylo and (most importantly) Rey was lacking.  There was no clear focus to the movie\\, and it felt like a \\\"bottle episode\\\" with the ship chase taking the focus of the majority of the movie.  There was no great lightsaber battle between the opposing forces and no use of the force as a weapon.  There was no back-story for the Snokes-Kylo relationship.  All-in-all the movie felt very surface level.  It lacked the depth of previous Star Wars movies.  I really don't know how they released this thinking the Star Wars fan base would be impressed.\\nThe good:\\nThese are few and far between\\, so it is easy to pick out the good moments.  There are a few dramtic moments of self-sacrifice that are dramatic\\, full of emotion.  One of these was visually stunning to the highest degree.  The joint fight against the \\\"Red Guys\\\" was excellent but I was hoping for more use of the force in the conflict (This also didn't stand up to the true 1-on-1 lightsaber matches that fans love).","true":true}
