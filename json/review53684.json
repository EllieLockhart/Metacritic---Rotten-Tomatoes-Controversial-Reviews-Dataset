Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a life long Star Wars fan and someone who loved ALL the films George Lucas did... this film was absolute drivel. Can understand now why Mark Hamill is so ashamed of it. It goes against everything that Star Wars is\\, it shows the writers (Star Wars Story Group aka Marketing Group) lack of knowledge on the franchise. The mythology is gone\\, or worse\\, completely misunderstood. It's not just the worst Star Wars film\\, it's a bad film all on its own. Any interesting questions raised by The Force Awakens were completely dropped. Who the hell is Snoke? How does he know the ways of The Force? How did he become Supreme Leader of The First Order? How was he able to influence Kylo Ren? What happened to the Knights of Ren? What is Rey's backstory? etc All completely wasted. Johnson is getting all the flack but it's Disney that is to blame for all of this. They are churning out muck because they know people will eat it anyway. They do not care about quality\\, they care about profits. Well congratulations\\, you've ensured that I will never see another Star Wars film again. Star Wars ended the day Lucas sold the rights to Disney.","true":true}
