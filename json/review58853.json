The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let me start with the easy stuff... the Graphics. Literally I can't expect the PS4\\, a console from the old-world to able to handle such beautiful graphics. I played the game in a PS4 Pro and the game run smoothly. The grass\\, the sea and oh my god the facial expressions. I am not an expert on sound\/music\/soundfx so I won't vote for that... although A-ha's Take on Me was a beautiful addition to the game. Now the story... nah not yet let's talk about the GAMEPLAY. I see people complain about the AI... well I don't agree. Movements are unpredictable and if you play in stealth all the time you can actual feel the thrill and the horror while you pass enemies undetected. Alternatively\\, you can try your luck with your one pistol bullet and your two arrows. Enemies will attack you from the most unexpected angles\\, if someone is shooting at you from a close distance you won't be able to reach him\\, and the big guys require two headshots (??) oops... not very realistic but let's play the \u2018it\u2019s just a game\u2019 card. Now the let\u2019s discuss the story. I believe most people don't have Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005). The good guy\\, father figure Joel dies... well let\u2019s face it he was a piece of sh1t for some others\\, doomed humanity and he was a killer. He was a survivor and naughty dog had the guts to remove his plot armour because sometimes you can't be too careful and sometimes you die. He did his worst\\, he tried his best\\, now it's time for him to rest. Whoever is reading this review I would like you to know that I loved the Joel character and if I was him I would probably followed the same road of decisions... doesn't mean I\/he was right. But let's don't talk about Joel anymore as he is not the main character. Ellie - is this the little girl from the first last of us? Not really. Ellie doesn't want to be left alone\\, Ellie cares for her friends. When I was five\\, I liked carrots\\, today I f hate them. People change and as the French say revenge is a dish best served cold. It's a meaningless path that consumes the little left of humanity left in you. Abbie did the same thing when all her friends were killed - the reason they died wasn't because of Ellie it was for Abbie's need of revenge and damn\\, it costed. Both characters did terrible things\\, in the end\\, they\u2019ve decided that revenge was meaningless\u2026 and it was too late. They lost everything. How can you hate a story like that? The simple answer is that you wanted a happy ending\\, ending with closure and a righteous main character that never makes mistakes. I can accept that but don\u2019t call the story terrible.
