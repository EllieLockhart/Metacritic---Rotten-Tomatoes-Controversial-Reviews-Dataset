Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not one of those overly dramatic\\, hardcore Star Wars fans proclaiming this movie to be the end of the world. It isn\u2019t terrible\\, but it isn\u2019t too good either. I\u2019ve been watching Star Wars movies since I was little\\, but this was the first one that really felt \u201coff\u201d to me. The prequels had their fair share of problems\\, but they still felt like Star Wars movies. Its almost as if Rian Johnson misunderstands what Star Wars is supposed to be\\, and what it means to people. On top of that\\, there were numerous plot holes and pointless character arcs (which were in my opinion the result of sloppy writing). In short\\, this movie was disappointing. And that\u2019s coming from someone who truly\\, genuinely wanted to love it.","true":true}
