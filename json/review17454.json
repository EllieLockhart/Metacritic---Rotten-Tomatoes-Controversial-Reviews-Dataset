Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie a week ago and\\, with each passing day\\, I grow more irritated with this film and what they did to Star Wars. Sure\\, the visuals are stunning at points\\, but this builds on the Force Awakens and continues to eviscerate the original storyline. I felt downright embarrassed for Mark Hamill and what they did to him in this movie. The narrative can be perplexing and wildly illogical at points\\, stripping my enthusiasm and capacity to engage in the movie or most of its characters. In the end\\, I was sad when I left the theater over what has become of a beloved storyline. Now\\, with a few days to ruminate on it\\, I'm left with anger.","true":true}
