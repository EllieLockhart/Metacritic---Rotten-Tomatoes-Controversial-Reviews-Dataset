Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie! The Last Jedi is absolutely amazing and defies all expectations in the best kind of way. Any prior thoughts or speculations that were had going into this movie were completely destroyed and I Liked It!!! Such awesome moments never before seen in a Star Wars movie\\, just those alone with great story telling makes this a worthy addition to the Star Wars mythology and movies and so forth! ","true":true}
