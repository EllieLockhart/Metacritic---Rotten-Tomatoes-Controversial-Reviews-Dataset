Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know people are divided but I loved the last jedi. It's not a perfect movie by far or even a perfect Star Wars movie but it finally takes us a new\\, fresh direction opening possibilities for future movies in the franchise instead of lazily re-making the same movies with new actors (Force awakens). Sure there's lots of flaws but i truly enjoyed it and am excited to see what will come next. I like that it was nothing I expected and opens up new possibility with a little more darkness which feels more real and grounded.","true":true}
