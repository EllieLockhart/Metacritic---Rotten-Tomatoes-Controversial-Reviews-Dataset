We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The biggest attraction of the game was the fraternal love that developed between Joel and Ellie throughout the entire game until the end\\, that's why everyone liked it\\, and they repeated the game (I repeated the game 7 times) The worst decision was to kill Joel at the start of the game\\, and replace the fraternal love that developed in the first game with love crap at first sight lol. We ALL bought the game from Joel and Ellie. We expect dramatic scenes between Joel and Ellie and the brilliant idea was to kill him after 40min of gameplay. The story of TLOU 2 is a total rubbish which I am sure NO ONE will play the game 2 times\\, for the simple reason that the story is not enjoyable ... in the first game the vast majority played the campaign several times .. I doubt very much that anyone wants to play it a second time. Another point\\, all the other characters could have been dismembered or burned alive and we wouldn't have minded ... BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DEVELOPED ATTACHMENT. The only attachment we had was the Joel - Ellie relationship (who was even having a hard time\\, and they could have worked from there). They really should fire those who had the stupid idea to eliminate fraternal love and incorporate love without any attachment from users\\, I don't think they can work on a TLOU 3. Ah\\, good job taking Ellie's fingers off her so she could never play the guitar again\\, the only thing Joel left her.\rit's a **** game of the year 2020\\, that is\\, ALL the games of this era can be scored 10\/10 in graphs and gameplay easily\\, what really makes the difference is a good use of resources in terms of characters\\, story\\, narrative\\, dialogues\\, etc. 1. They forced the use of a character with whom we had no developed attachment. (IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE RESULT WOULD NOT BE GOOD.)2. We were tricked with the trailers\\, thinking Joel would be an accompanying character (Joel).3. The worst use of resources I have seen in years\\, should be ashamed to do this rubbish in so many years...Joel's death mismanaged\\, if only killed mid-game or given a \\\"dignified\\\" death and in the process \\\"develop\\\" attachment to Abby.For example: Playing with Ellie and Joel as Abby searches for Joel (and that way we are presented to Abby in a different way\\, ASI develops character attachment). But NOOOO Hahaha we'll have Abby kill one of the game's biggest resources at the first hour of play and then force you to play with Abby for 7 hours...that can go wrong?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
