Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stay Clear of this one. Story line makes no sense and very poor character development. I could go on and on about how bad it is but I won't. If you decide to go you'll find it is a waste of time and money!","true":true}
