Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow bummer\\, that stunk. Princess Leia flying thru outer space? Dumb jokes\\, annoying cgi animals?  In this current political climate its obvious what Disney is more interested in here. Political agenda over good movies.  ALL of the evil characters (Nazis) were European White males. Then the evil bad rich city full of aliens and exclusivly white people. Destroy\\, destroy\\, \\\"doesn't that feel good to tear up their city ? the Finn character exclaims. If you don't believe this\\, walk on to any university campus\\, and these ideas are everywhere. My dad was one of these European white males and he received the Metal of Honor in WW II for his service fighting\\, and yes killing Nazi's. None of the idiots that wrote this stupid movie would have a voice without men like my father. I am sick and tired of all this racist regressive political garbage.","true":true}
