Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved the movie as soon as I walked out of the movie theatre. But the more I thought about the movie and talked to my family about it I realised it was not perfect. I honestly hate how the got rid of snoke so easily. I feel like a battle against him would have been better then the casino and code breaker mission. That being said I did not hate this side mission but it really had no purpose. Yes it brings fin and rose to the first order but this could have been done in different more interesting ways. For example trying to save Rey and eventually helping the battle against snoke (which really should have happened).overall the battles were great\\, it brought some old characters back and really set up for a great next movie + I love what they did with Luke but I feel snoke was under used and the casino trip over used.","true":true}
