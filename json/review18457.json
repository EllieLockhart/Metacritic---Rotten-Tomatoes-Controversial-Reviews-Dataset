Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is in some ways nearly unfathomable that a movie this good--one that plays with its predecessors' rhythms so joyfully and so effectively--barely outscores bored Tarantino garbage like Django Unchained\\, which does not. TLJ is not a perfect film and the postmodern irrelevant subplot will annoy traditionalists\\, but the thrill of the new and the graceful exit of the old (my lord--it is good to see Yoda back on his game after the CGI horrors of the prequels) makes TLJ a lasting artistic contribution to the franchise.","true":true}
