Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film is not good. I've watched it several times and im really trying to like the movie but i can't. This movie is filled with bad jokes and character. Bad writing\\, horrible sub plots\\,   are mistreated with bad scenes. This film does feminism wrong as well. I understand that starwars is trying to bring in female audiences as well but this movie goes overboard with that because they've added more female characters who are just horribly written and do more things","true":true}
