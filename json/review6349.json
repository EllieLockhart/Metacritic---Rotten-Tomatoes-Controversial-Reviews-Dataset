Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney need to do the right thing and remake this mess....admit you got it wrong and get Lucas or JJ to remake it...\\n\\nRian must be very lazy if he could not even get it to line up properly with the force awakens...He managed to get a huge SW fan to LOATHE a SW movie....and the treatment of Luke in this movie makes this a modern day   disasterpiece.this movie has played on my mind ever since i watched it\\,\\,\\,\\,and all for the wrong reasons....heartbroken.","true":true}
