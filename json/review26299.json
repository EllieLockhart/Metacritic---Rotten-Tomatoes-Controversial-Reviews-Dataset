Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst constructed film in the franchise (cough\\, cough Attack of the Clones) but it still greatly suffers from poor passing\\, a meandering plot\\, superfluous characters\\, plot twist endued whip lash. The entire film felt Disney was telling me to let go of the Lucas era and to gt on board with their new sequel system\\, and while I am sure this will be challenged as fanboyism (even though I only really like 5 of the 9 films) I felt as though that this movie was hateful towards the audience. It was too violent for kids\\, too stupid for adults\\, too plot-hole ridden for film buffs and to subtle to be a good stupid popcorn flick. It was too alienating for long time fans\\, and too removed from the newer films. It's the ultimate odd duck\\, and given that it was the child of the incredibly talented Rian Johnson\\, this film\\, while not the worst in the franchise on a technical level\\, is easily the most disappointing and heart breaking since the Phantom Menace. My feelings towards this film\\, and the continuation of the franchise are likely best described by the first words I uttered upon leaving the theater\\, \\\"I'm\\, done!\\\"","true":true}
