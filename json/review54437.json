Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like Star Wars\\, but I don't LOVE it. I frequently rewatch the original trilogy\\, I can cite trivia and quote the films better than your average Joe. I own little Star Wars merchandise and I've never worn a Star Wars costume.\\n\\nFor me\\, Star Wars has always been good entertainment. Like the hardcore fans\\, I have a generally negative opinion of the prequel trilogy\\, but unlike many hardcore fans I have genuinely enjoyed these last three films.\\n\\nThey may not live up to my expectations\\, they may not do things I want\\, they may also do things I want but not in the way I want. But I firmly believe that these films should not be bound by the sequels\\, the prequels\\, the fans' expectations or the flow of The Force Awakens and everything that it established. \\n\\nGood entertainment demands that expectations be defied. Boundaries must be broken and with franchises like Star Wars\\, characters will come and go in the telling of the story. Maybe with too much ceremony\\, maybe not nearly enough. Maybe some characters don't get a chance to fulfill their potential. But that is storytelling in a nutshell.\\n\\nRealistically\\, not everything bears fruit. And if it did\\, it would come at the expense of the already shaky flow of the film\\, as well as any films that follow. But I tend to avoid being that analytical or critical of what I deem simple entertainment. I've always regarded Star Wars as good\\, silly fun. And darker tones and aging stars shouldn't detract from that. Those are two of the main reasons for why the prequel trilogy didn't work for me. \\n\\nI would consider this film very solid entertainment\\, even for die hard Star Wars fans. The open-minded ones anyway. Those who feel that the very last page of the Star Wars bible was penned years ago and no further expansion or liberties should be taken might fall into one of several traps that will result in departing the theater in a negative mood.\\n\\nThis could go on to be one of my favorite Star Wars movies\\, because in my opinion it does everything a Star Wars movie needs to do\\, but also defies expectations in a refreshing way. It's an expertly crafted special effects popcorn flick that expands on a time-honored franchise and sets up a finale installment that I'm eager to see whether it hits a bullseye with all the expectations that this film created or not.\\n\\nVerdict: 8.7\/10","true":true}
