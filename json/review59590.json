Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"in order to fix this game and actually make the story work all they had to do was replace Joel with Dina and make Joel die a heroic death saving Ellie from one of the factions from the story while in pursuit for Dina's killer making Joel's death so much more impactful to then go and avenge both Ellie's lover and father figures deaths. but at the same time without turning to the killer's point of view so it's just a story from Ellies' perspective. also\\, make Ellie meet lev and he's older sister and work them into Ellies' story as they felt like a good edition from a character perspective but need plot tweaks. that's it really\\, the game itself is visually stunning and the gameplay felt really good but unfortunately\\, the story denies any success from everyone else's hard work to make the game achieve legendary status. The ending would need to change so that Ellie gets her revenge which gives the player meaning to carry on to the end.\r\rpersonally I couldn't care less about the inclusion of LGBTQ characters as long as it feels natural and doesn't feel like they were placed into a game just for the sake of ticking boxes. As a gamer\\, I don't want to see political agendas in a game I just want to enjoy the story\/gameplay for example if Abby's dad was a bodybuilder and she wanted to take after her dad then that's more natural and would make sense after her loss but currently\\, I can't think of any reason why she would become the hulk in a world of harsh survival and scarce resources.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
