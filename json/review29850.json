Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Risky yet a bold move. The so called \\\" real\\\" star wars fans hated .Instead of continuing the saga with more mediocre content\\, it creates a new dimension to the series and fill up the gaps from TFA. Hopefully JJ Abrams dont ruin the next one.","true":true}
