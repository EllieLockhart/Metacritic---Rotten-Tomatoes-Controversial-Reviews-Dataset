Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hurts to give this rating\\, but there\u2019s reasons for it. The number 1 reason\\, as mentioned within another review: \u201cEvery possible plot thread was closed in the worst possible way!\u201d What do we have to look forward to now in the next movie\/episode? There\u2019s no more mystery... now to battle\\, but we know the results of. 2nd reason: it didn\u2019t have that Star Wars feeling... didn\u2019t have that deep methodically aspect of the Force... it was more comedic than anything. 3rd reason: where\u2019s the galactic concern or fear of evil taking over?! There wasn\u2019t any... this whole Republic vs Empire felt isolated. I just feel empty. On the flip side\\, great acting and visuals! Good battle scenes! ","true":true}
