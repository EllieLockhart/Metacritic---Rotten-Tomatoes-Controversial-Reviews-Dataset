Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's not what I was expecting. Realistically hero worship aside\\, what happened with Luke's character humanized him. I don't want to spoil it\\, but what happened needed to happen in order for things to be torn down and started anew.","true":true}
