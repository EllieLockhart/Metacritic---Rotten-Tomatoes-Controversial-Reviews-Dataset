Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an adventurous departure from what you think a Star Wars can be. However\\, it includes many Disney tropes that play it very safe\\, and inserts comedy is unnecessary. This movie goes it's own way\\, but departs from what was set up in The Force Awakens. The character relations between Luke\\, Kylo and Rey are handled beautifully and make for some of the best moments in Star Wars.","true":true}
