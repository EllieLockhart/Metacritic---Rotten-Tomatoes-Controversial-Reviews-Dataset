Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am 47 years old and I have been a DIE hard Star Wars fan since the beginning. I saw the original SW back in 1977 in the movie theaters. In fact\\, I have been to the opening debut of EVERY SINGLE SW movie. The original trilogy is BY FAR the best movies ever and I was hooked ever since.... After the Force awakens and how it was basically Star Wars but with a Female hero who did not EARN her powers (And so much more I will not get into here)\\, I was getting fed up with how you are treating the Star Wars fans like myself. I refused to pay to see this one. A friend had an extra ticket and after some convincing\\, I decided to go since the ticket was free for me... What a mistake. This movie proves that you do NOT care about Star Wars lore\\, or the fans\\, you care about $$$$. The way you handled my FAVORITE HERO OF ALL TIME Luke Skywalker was just pathetic... There are so many plot holes\\, things that made NO SENSE\\, characters added CLEARLY to SELL TOYS\\, and this movie ANGERED ME... And because of how you treated one of the best heroes of all time and had him just die alone on a mountain after he was nothing but depressed and suicidal made me NEVER WANT TO SEE ANOTHER Star Wars movie again. IT is clear the critics get paid to give you high ratings but the fans are speaking LOUD AND CLEAR... You RUINED Star Wars with your greed\\, you made a mockery out of my favorite hero and it seems you only added the original cast to lure in us old fans only to have them all die off unceremoniously  so you can get these new people in for a newer generation who gets excited by bright flashing lights.... There is no story\\, there is no consequence\\, there is no earning of the heroes affection. Luke was so loved because it took THREE movies to develop his character so we could grow to love him\\, even when he doubted and faltered. Ray NEVER EARNS THIS... And to say that she comes from no one was just lazy writing. You did this so now you can make ANYONE into a JEDI so you can keep making movies.... Well I for one will NEVER pay for another SW movie as long it is in Disneys hands.... Shame on you for doing this to us... SW was almost a religion to millions of people for decades and you shat all over that... But as they say\\, fool me once\\, shame on YOU\\, fool me twice\\, Shame on ME... NEVER AGAIN...","true":true}
