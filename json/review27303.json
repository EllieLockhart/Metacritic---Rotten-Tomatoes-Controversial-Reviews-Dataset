Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only Sith deal in absolutes. Fans must reach out farther to fully experience Episode XIII: The Last Jedi. Last Jedi challenges viewers to reexamine Star Wars with an open mind and heart. Its characters\\, new and old\\, forge connections that tie together disparate pieces from across the previous trilogies. I look forward to the continued saga of Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and Kylo in Episode IX.","true":true}
