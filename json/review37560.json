Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a lot of critical reviews here\\, many of which I'm not sure have actually seen the movie. I have only read\\, at time of posting\\, 4 pages of reviews\\, but there is a number of political agenda feeling posts behind this\\, more then actual critics.\\n\\nWhat I will say is\\, if you follow the story it is quite well written\\, paired with some powerful visual storytelling. Some characters could use more time then they had on screen\\, but with as many moving pieces as there were\\, I feel the movie did a good job. The character writing was genuinely fun and compelling\\, with Mark Hamill getting especial kudos.\\n\\nThe music felt very Star Wars\\, but I'm not sure there is anything I would really call a new track\\, instead of just a remastering or remix of an old one.\\n\\nThe Leia scene wasn't that bad to me - I saw it in imax\\, I loved it\\, its a love letter straight to extended universe fans\\, and exactly how such a thing would look.","true":true}
