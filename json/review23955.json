Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man oh man. So incredible. I'll start with what I didn't like: I didn't like the purple-haired lady\\, I didn't like the alien milk scene\\, I think they over did Poe's rebellious nature\\, and did Rose and Finn really have to save all the cute animals while all their friends were about to die? BUT NOW\\, THE GOOD STUFF: the soundtrack oh man I listen to it every day. The costumes: brilliant! designed beautifully! Rey's slightly changed attire is wonderful! Leia's clothing is striking\\, elegant\\, strong! Kylo Ren is dressed like a legend! The cinematic beauty of it all! There were scenes that quite literally took my breath away! I was in awe! A masterpiece! The over-arching themes!! Obi-Wan hesitated to fight Anakin even after he had watched him murder children\\, because he believed there was still good in him. Luke hesitated to kill Vader even after Vader tortured his sister Leia\\, crushed planets\\, & wasted hundreds of Jedi lives\\, because he believed there was still light in him. Rey did not kill Kylo Ren because she saw Ben Solo in him\\, because it is the Jedi way to hold out for light\\, and good\\, and trust in the Force. Excellent! Moving! Terrific!","true":true}
