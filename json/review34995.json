Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was boring and the characters were not memorable. I was confused by the casino sequence which led to a random del Toro bit part that meant nothing. Seriously though who really wants to watch a show chase in space (ooh but they're going really fast) with curving lasers for 2 damn hours. The last battle with those useless ships was one of the dumbest scenes I have ever seen.  What the hell was the point of the movie?  What the Snoke?  Nothing makes any sense anymore.","true":true}
