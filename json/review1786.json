Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars\\, I'll give it 3.5 stars. But as a movie-movie it's about a 1.5. Bloated\\, boring\\, stuffed to the gills with lame jokes\\, terrible acting\\, pointless sideplots\\, dumb-looking new aliens. Some of the production design is absolutely brilliant--this LOOKS like Star Wars. The throne room fight looks cool until you realize Snoke's guards haven't been set up as anything other than furniture. Some of the space battles are great but because I don't care about any of the characters they're not all that interesting. The much-maligned Luke stuff is actually the best part of the movie. But in the end\\, this movie actually doesn't provide any compelling reasons to see episode IX. If we were actually going to close the door on the Star Wars saga after this movie\\, this would be a fine place to end it. Unfortunately this has to be a trilogy\\, and we'll get an unnecessary conclusion in a couple years.","true":true}
