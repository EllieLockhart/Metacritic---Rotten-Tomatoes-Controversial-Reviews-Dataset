Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a huge fan of the new star wars\\, i grew up watching the old ones. But this last one was surprisingly good. I wanted a little more action in it but had to wait till the end before that got good\\, but i really liked the story of the last Jedi!","true":true}
