Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful cinematography and excellent acting are completely overshadowed by nonsensical plot points and characterization that doesn't fit with the rest of the saga. \\n\\nA great sequel makes the film(s) before it even better; The Last Jedi somehow makes the film before it worse while spitting in the face of the original trilogy and its characters in the process.","true":true}
