Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was so looking forward to seeing this. I'm a die hard fan to anything and everything Star Wars.This movie ruined the Star Wars legacy though. So many plot holes and bad character development. Wrote out list with problems with movie and I'm at number #56 with problems. Was going to post every problem\\, but it would be way to long. Most people already know all the bad. Wish they would hire someone to direct these movie who actually understands the Star wars Universe. I don't think Rian Johnson understands the Star wars Universe at all. RIP Star wars","true":true}
