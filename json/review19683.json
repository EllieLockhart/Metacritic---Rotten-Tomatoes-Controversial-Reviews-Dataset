Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie. Not a great movie though. The Last Jedi built with such an intense hype in my opinion did not live up to what seemingly promised to be the best Star Wars movie ever. With numerous characters lacking enough substance to really care about the movie and large plot holes\\, I think 3\/5 stars is about right. Sadly\\, people seem to accept this movie as the beginning of the future of Star Wars which doesn't give it a promising future to the fans of old. Those big questions everybody wanted answered about Snoke and Rey\\, were given simple and unexciting answers which could have created future storylines in the movie. Instead it would appear the goal was just to wrap up as many loose ends as possible before the movie ended.","true":true}
