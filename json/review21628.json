Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Joined rotten tomatoes to wrote this review. The movie absolutely sucked! The trailers were better than the movie. This is the only Star Wars movie I walked out saying I will not see that again in theater. Even attacking of the clones I saw twice. I will not renew my annual disney passes and I will sell my shares in the company for what they did with this movie. They should announce it was a joke and remake it. I don't know how anyone is defending this movie and Rian Johnson. Disgraceful film.","true":true}
