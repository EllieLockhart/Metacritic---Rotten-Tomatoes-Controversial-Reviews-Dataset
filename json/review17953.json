Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it's good\\, it's probably really good\\, it could even be great. It's hard to know how good without repeated viewings\\, and giving it time to settle in to what we consider canonical Star Wars mythology.\\nAll these supposed superfans jumping in and saying it's worse than the prequels are just flat out wrong IMO. I think it may even be better than the Force Awakens. Only time will tell.\\n\\nDon't forget that critics and superfans also panned Empire when it came out.","true":true}
