Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why the fuck does my rating keep trying to lower itself? I gave it 5 stars\\, get that through your empty fucking skulls! Why the fuck is this website such a buggy piece of shit? Why the fuck are \\\"people\\\" (actually bots in all likelihood) allowed to post the same exact nonsense over and over again\\, typos and all? And why the fuck is this nonsensical drivel being counted more than once? You claim to have people working to keep bots and duplicates out of the audience reactions? Either you're lying\\, or the people you've hired to do that job aren't earning their fucking keep and I'm not about to give you  lousy bastards the benefit of the doubt!You've had a fucking month to get your fucking shit together! What is the fucking hold up? Why should anyone trust your website after all this? You couldn't have dropped the fucking ball any harder if you were forced to at gunpoint!  It's bad enough you let these bots keep regurgitating that typographically mangled nonsense\\, but trying to change my rating behind my back? What the actual fuck\\, Rotten Tomatoes?","true":true}
