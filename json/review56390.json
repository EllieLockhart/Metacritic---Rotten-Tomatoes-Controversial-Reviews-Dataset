Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst of all the Star Wars movies\\, this is basically a bad version of the Guardians of the Galaxy trying to take itself seriously.\\nI can't really share any negative sentiments that haven't already been stated\\, but basically this movie is nothing more than a bunch of disjointed scenes\\, forced and ill timed humor\\, and cutesy merchandising shilling.  Worst of all\\, it takes all the previous cannon and it's characters\\, and unceremoniously kills them all off in the most demeaning way possible.  It's basically \\\"we must dispose of the old patriarchal Jedi establishment\\, and replace it with the newer\\, wiser\\, socialist girl powah Jedi\\\".  The handled Luke\\, Admiral Akbar\\, and the entire Jedi legacy built up in the previous 7 movies as if they were HIV infected rubbers that needed to be disposed of.   Beyond horrible\\, and even if the \\\"critics\\\" could somehow ignore the blatant political messaging and social justice narrative\\, it was simply poorly directed\\, edited\\, and written.  My respect for \\\"critics\\\" now ranks up there with so called \\\"journalists\\\".","true":true}
