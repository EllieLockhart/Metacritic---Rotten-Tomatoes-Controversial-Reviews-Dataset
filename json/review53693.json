Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From what I got out of The Last Jedi\\, I may as well have watched Fast and Furious 54. Completely lost sight of all the work that was done in the Original Trilogy. The character Luke Skywalker is turned from a Master Jedi and hero\\, to a coward so quickly it is laughable. Every question you are left asking at the end of Episode VII is either still unanswered\\, or played off as so insignificant to the point where you leave the theatre feeling like an idiot. Enormous plot holes that are attempted to be covered by additions of more insignificant characters. ","true":true}
