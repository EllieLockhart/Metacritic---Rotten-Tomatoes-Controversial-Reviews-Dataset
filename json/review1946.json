Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A smarter movie then given credit for. However a director who often felt out of control and just your standard studio hire. It's the Master and Commander of Star Wars films; you love it then you hate it. A intelligent person can go back and forth on this one. Still the failure to develop our primary protagonist from the previous trilogy Luke Skywalker only stilted on Kylo Ren and Rey's relationship. Plus jumping to side characters Finn and Rose misadventure and deliberately halting the development Oscar Issac's fascinating bravado as Poe Dameron for Laura Dern's unnecessary character whom the late Carrie Fisher could've played as Princess Leia only continued to hurt the film. Still Daisy Ridely and Adam Driver had an interesting sibling like relationship had it been fully fledged out it may have strengthened the film. Had Luke not been stilted the film may have been stronger. ","true":true}
