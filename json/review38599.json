Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I don\u00b4t care about nnothing on the new characters\\, they don\u00b4t have charisma and the director killed the true purpose of Luke Skywalker\\, who in the original saga\\, he was couraged and positive... in this movie he is reduced to be a coward and all the things that he did in the past seems to have no sense. This movie killed my intention to see episode 9 and I cannot care less from the characters of Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe.","true":true}
