Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG what have they done...\\nThe moment I got out of cinema I felt empty inside. Can't believe what they did with this movie. I can understand wanting to change the direction of the movie and make it unique but wtf it went sideways on so many levels. It doesn't even feel like star wars but a generic sci fi with shallow story. They broke Luke's character\\, killed of Snoke without any explanation to his background\\, they made Leia fly though space\\, forced out of place jokes\\, nonsensical main plot where the first order could have easily light speed couple of destroyers in front of the rebel ships cutting them off\\, pointless casino scene\\, pointless Benisio del toro character\\, pointless Rose...the list goes on...Really disappointing movie :(","true":true}
