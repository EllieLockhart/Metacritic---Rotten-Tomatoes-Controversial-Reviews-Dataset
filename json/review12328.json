Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so sorry about this movie. It was not just a waste of time and money\\, it was a waste of hope. You guys killed my hope in the future of Star Wars. My only hope left is that now the market will punish you for this awful scrip and movie. Bye.","true":true}
