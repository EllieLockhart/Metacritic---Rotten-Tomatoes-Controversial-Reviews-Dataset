Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trying to figure out where this saga is headed. Luke Skywalker acts as if he has a touch of dementia and seems disinterested. If the fate of the alliance falls on the shoulders of these characters they are doomed\\, even if the storm troopers aim is so poor. Some good action scenes though\\, but I grow increasingly weary of the dialogue","true":true}
