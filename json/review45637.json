Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very dissapointing\\, great effects and acting\\, it looked amazing\\, but the plot was damn awful\\, totally destroyed the original trilogy. Luke Skywalker\\, what was the point? Hyperspace ship ram\\, why didn't the resistance do that to the Death Star? Rhian Johnson was looking for the surprise factor\\, unfortunately they were detrimental to the plot.","true":true}
