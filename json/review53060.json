Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie\\, but as a fan there were some narrative directions that just made me feel as if RJ just wanted to distance himself from JJs as much as possible. As good as this movie was for me it didnt feel at home in this trilogy and because of that it takes me out of it. All hope is not lost because im confident that if episode 9 is done correctly and wraps up things nicely it could bring up my opinion of LJ but until then Im giving it a strong 3\/5 ","true":true}
