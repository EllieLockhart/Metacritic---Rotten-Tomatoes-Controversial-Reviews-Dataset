Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible\\, I am so disappointed with the direction they took for this movie\\, they completely destroyed some of our most beloved characters and ran their legacies into the ground while forcing these new unmemorable rejects down our throats. I'm done with Disneys \\\"Star Wars\\\" for good.","true":true}
