Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nSnoke and Phasma were wasted characters\\, Finn and rose plotline was 100% unnecessary\\, act 2 of the movie was boring and really bad. The whole \\\"time bomb\\\" with the star destroyer and rebel fleet thing was awful\\, and minimized the scale of the movie in comparison to the other films in the series. Very disappointed.","true":true}
