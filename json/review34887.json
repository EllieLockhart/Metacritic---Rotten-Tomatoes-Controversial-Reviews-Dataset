Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The few moments of greatness are choked out by a terribly written story which may have killed off the future of Star Wars. It was interesting to watch (once)\\, but for the world of Star Wars\\, it was a complete disaster. There is nothing to talk about for the next two years and nothing to be anxious for. Nothing but a sense of disappointment lingers. The character decisions made in this film have actually soiled some of the previous films. It's that bad. So much potential wasted.","true":true}
