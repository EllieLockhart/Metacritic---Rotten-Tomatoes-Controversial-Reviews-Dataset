Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is clear to me from reading the user reviews that there is a correlation between users who dislike this movie and the degenerates who support Donald Trump\\, which means that most of the reviews trashing 'The Last Jedi' are extremely stupid.\\n\\nThere is some sort of campaign by degenerate conservatives and right-wing neo-fascists to discredit this movie. I think it is driven by racism\\, neo-patriotism\\, and sexism. These degenerates can't handle the female character\\, they can't handle the emotional characters\\, they can't handle the multiculturalism\\, and they can't handle that in 'The Last Jedi'\\, concepts of goodness and fairness are at odds with conservative Republican ideals.\\n\\nThe negative audience reviews pouring in on Rotten Tomatoes seem almost bot-like. Read them. They're terrible. The vast majority of them are fallacious at best and embarrassingly\\, pathetically moronic and stupid at worst. I mean\\, these people sound like idiots or even worse\\, bigots.\\n\\nIt's sad that the Trump-supporting tyrants have such a powerful presence online. Because their voices are so loud and stupid\\, they seem numerous\\, but really they're not. They're just screaming for attention as the world continues to tell them that they are worthless\\, obsolete models of human beings.\\n\\nThat's my review\\, because these user scores are political now\\, thanks to the bigots and pieces of garbage in the United States. I'm ashamed of these punks.\\n\\n\\nThe movie is great. \\n\\nRead the critics reviews.\\n\\nIgnore the audience reviews written by all of these hateful degenerates. Sick\\, pathetic people. Just... cancer.","true":true}
