Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some pretty great moments in this film & it certainly has its moments where it shines\\, (particularly with further character development with Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, & Luke). However I am not a fan of the cheap jokes that have plagued this reboot series & recent Hollywood movies in general. This movie is really beautiful & the cinematography is very well done\\, but it seems like there are too many characters & too many plot lines to follow which makes each of their story feel weaker. I find the supporting characters weak (Finn\\, Rose\\, Poe\\, etc.)\\, & that they have more screen time than they should. It feels like they were on the verge of greatness for this movie\\, but were too afraid to take real risks with story so now we are left with a semi-adventurous story that is not very emotional & with a lot of unanswered questions. This movie is certainly A WHOLE lot better than The Force Awakens\\, & I personally did enjoy it. I just wish they would focus more on the story & dialogue between characters rather than riding on nostalgia\\, beautiful action sequences\\, & cheap jokes directed towards almost breaking the fourth wall.","true":true}
