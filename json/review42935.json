Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a disappointment. I feel as though I overestimated The Last Jedi after seeing The Force Awakens and Rogue One. The plot has so many illogical flaws and the characters portrayed as powerful in the comics were just frustrating and wasteful. Rian Johnson had so many chances to make this movie amazing\\, but now I feel that I need to go back and rewatch the old movie to reignite my fizzled love for Star Wars.","true":true}
