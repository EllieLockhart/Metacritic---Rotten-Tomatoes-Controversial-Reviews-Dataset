Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. The story arc is disappointing\\, disjointed\\, underdeveloped\\, OVERdeveloped\\, not developed. Sure\\, confound all of our expectations but at least replace it with something worthwhile\\, compelling\\, smile-inducing. If the goal was to tear down everything up to this point in the SW universe to replace it with some sanitized agenda driven drivel... success? Wow.\\n\\nNo better than a mediocre Star Wars Rebels episode\\, I expect more from a Star Wars movie. Episode 1 made more sense and at least had an understandable story line! :-) Let's just say Rogue One was over the top amazingly great compared to VIII.\\n\\nMany years ago after watching Phantom Menace in the theater I rushed home to immediately watch New Hope to see why I felt so disappointed about PM. Now\\, years later\\, after watching The Last Jedi\\, I rushed home to watch Phantom Menace!\\n\\nNot sure the \\\"top critics\\\" watched the same movie!\\n\\nChewy becomes a vegan! Yeah\\, right!\\n\\nOh\\, and yes\\, I signed up for an account just so I could write this review\\, that's how perturbed I was. :-) I am not a bot! :-) :-)","true":true}
