Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the movie have its flaws\\, yes.  But that shouldn't ruin the experience for you.  There were some truly great scenes and it opens the Star Wars universe to more than the light vs dark side conflicts of the past.","true":true}
