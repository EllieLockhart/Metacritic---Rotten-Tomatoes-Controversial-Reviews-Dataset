Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was a life long Star Wars fan until watching TLJ. The plot was terrible\\, from the beginning scene in which I thought I was watching a guardians of the galaxy spin off\\, to luke creepily milking some weird animal\\, to the movie long slow motion space ship chase. This terrible plot was made (if possible) even worse by feminist anti white rhetoric. Thanks to leftist\\, progressive Disney\\, in the new Star Wars universe  the bad guys are all white males. The good guys Have to be female and or non white.  White male rebels either try to kill people in their sleep becasue of a dream\\, or are reckless\\, filled with testosterone unable to make correct decisions without the leadership of women generals. I fully expect the next movie to be a full fledged documentary on liberal ideology. A LGBTQ\\, feminist\\, transgender\\, Bruce Jenner cockbuster.","true":true}
