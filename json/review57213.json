Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This \\\"movie\\\" and I shudder to call it such\\, spends more time preaching it's heavy handed political agenda and exploring just how far Rian Johnson can shove his head up his ass\\, it's like everyone involved forgot how to make a movie with characters and plot. They made Luke Skywalker\\, a childhood hero to many\\, into a cold-blooded child murderer. How do you mess up this character that badly? Well\\, it's simple. Spend all of your time and energy making sure that every inch of this god forsaken movie tows the political line. Make sure every male character is talked down to  and shown up by a woman\\, because female empowerment on its own isn't enough to be equality. This movie is political propaganda from the bowels of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson\\, and it is a blight on an already questionable film reputation.","true":true}
