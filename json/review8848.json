Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For my money this is the greatest addition to the Star Wars legacy since \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\". Rian Johnson is a born filmmaker\\, and he revitalizes this franchise in new and exciting ways. The story risks everything\\, even the way of the Jedi\\, in order to provide its characters with a place to grow and change\\, much like life. And then there's the visuals and the humor. For much of the running time I watched this film with a huge smile on my face. It is a significant accomplishment that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" can surprise and delight us so many decades into this franchise.","true":true}
