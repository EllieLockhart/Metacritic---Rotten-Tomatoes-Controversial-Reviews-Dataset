Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. I guess Leia was actually from Krypton. I'm still trying to figure out how Rian Johnson thought it was a solid plan to make the most optimistic character with more honor than anyone in the galaxy afraid to fight for what's right and to save his loved ones. Terrible and soul crushing. If you wanted to make something seperate from the Star Wars we grew up with why didn't you simply make a new franchise. A**hole.","true":true}
