Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\, written and cast by committee\\, is better than it has any reason to be. The cynical studio knows that they do not need to put out a quality product to make a big profit here. That said\\, there are some charming things here that do not go over the top. The music score is superb as always. The computer effects are wonderful.\\n\\nWhat this movie lacks is originality and a raison d'\u00eatre. The plot and characters are just so paint by numbers\\, the action sequences beautiful but bereft of soul. The stakes are non-existent. \\n\\nAdam Driver is very good as Kylo Ren\\, as nuanced a villain as this franchise has ever seen.","true":true}
