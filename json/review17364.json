Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Irreverent garbage with no respect for the core Star Wars mythos and its heroes. Every character in this film is a scumbag and a coward with selfish interests. Total character assassination of Luke. Leia isn't treated much better. Good going\\, Disney. You killed Star Wars. That didn't take long.","true":true}
