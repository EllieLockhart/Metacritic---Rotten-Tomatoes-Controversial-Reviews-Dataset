Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't like the direction the films are going\\, most of the main characters are dead\\, questions that were asked in force awakens were answered poorly\\, don't want to see another resistance beats the odds story line just because they are full of hope\\, you wanna see sith and apprentice with amazing light saber battles\\, I feel that luke was portrayed poorly making him act differently and wanting to kill a child\\, all the kids use force powers easily when anakin needed so much training\\, I feel we are being robbed of decent stories and being turned into a game of who can do the biggest twists\\, alot of characters and story arcs have been killed off.
