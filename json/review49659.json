Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow was this movie BORING! Holy cow....No pay off at all and the so called \\\"Critics\\\" gave this movie a 91%??? They are selling all their credibility for what exactly? Episode 9 will be just as big of a failure as solo.","true":true}
