Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u00e2??t get everyone\u00e2??s issue. Fan theories weren\u00e2??t fulfilled and that\u00e2??s the sole reason this has received such negative rebuttal from its loyal following. It\u00e2??s a great movie that leaves the predictable\\, unpredictable.","true":true}
