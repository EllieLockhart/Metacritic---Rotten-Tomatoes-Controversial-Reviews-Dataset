Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. I'd rather watch the Phantom Menace on repeat for an eternity than see that movie again. I guess Disney was just counting on the fact that there are enough children and idiots out there to sell merchandise to that there's really no point in putting out anything that even remotely resembles a quality film","true":true}
