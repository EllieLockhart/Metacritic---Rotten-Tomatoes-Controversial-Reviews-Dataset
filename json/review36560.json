Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had more filler than a taco bell burrito... Some useful dialog explaining things would have been nice.  Rose was more useless than Jar Jar. Camel-horse-dogs are a thing now. Purple haired space feminists will sacrifice their crew when someone mansplains to them. And apparently you can destroy ships with hyperspace now.  Oh yeah and we still didn't learn anything new that was left unexplained in the last movie.","true":true}
