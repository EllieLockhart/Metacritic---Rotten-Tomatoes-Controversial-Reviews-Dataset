Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just don't understand why so many critics like this pile of disrespectful turd. A massive amount of plot holes and inconsistencies\\, all rolled up in a forced plot. It felt like I was watching Batman VS Superman again!  Maybe it's because expectations were set on episode 7 but never delivered on. But that's good storytelling 101 you set a mood\\, a tone\\, and tell your views\/readers what they should expect. Then you deliver! The director of this movie wanted to mimic the formula of Game of Thrones which has no place in this universe unless done in its own spin off movies.  \\n\\n\\\"You just didn't get it.\\\"\\n \\nNO! You didn't get it. You still don't get it. The reason why so many are upset by this movie: What's the point in hyping up characters in the first film if you're not going to use them properly? Why kill off beloved characters with a bunch of rookies? Why make said beloved characters stupid and oblivious to their coming doom\\, or even whiny during their last moments? This could very well be the last time you see these lifetime heroes\\, and this is the best \\\"Hoorah!\\\" you can give them? Why are the bad guys so goddam weak\\, useless and whiny. Why are people not using common sense? Why are people falling in love in less than 12 hours after meeting someone? Why are Phasma and The Knights of Ren forgotten or completely useless?   \\n\\n\\\"You just set your expectation too high. You let your hype get the best of you.\\\" \\n\\nSo I should turn off my brain? Sit in the theater like I was watching an episode of The Kardashians? Sorry that I expected BASIC storytelling\\, a stable and meaningful representation of established characters. This movie needed more explanation\\, a satisfying end to old friends\\, and a reason to care for the new cast. The visual\\, the acting\\, the idea is fine\\, but the execution of the ongoing plot added with the dislocated story in each main installment is just... a mess.\\n It's incredibly difficult to look at these movies with no outlook when an established expectation has already been set by its previous creators and\\, again\\, not met. Instead\\, we get this abstract art\\, which is beautiful in its own way but is seen by a lot of fans as an unorthodox continuation and a betrayal of all that they loved about this world. It's understandable why Mark Hamill himself disliked the direction this trilogy was taking but had to keep his mouth shut due to his contract. \\n\\n\\\"I at one point had to say to Rian\\, 'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character. Now\\, having said that\\, I have gotten it off my chest\\, and my job now is to take what you've created and do my best to realize your vision.'\\\" -Mark Hamill-\\n\\nOnce the dust settled\\, and my adrenaline was back to normal\\, it's just... one.... big... disappointment. So much lost potential\\, wasted. I kept quiet with the Force Awakes\\, (everyone gets one) but I just can't do this anymore. Luckily\\, I was smart enough and lucky enough to find a way to view this movie without giving Disney a dime.","true":true}
