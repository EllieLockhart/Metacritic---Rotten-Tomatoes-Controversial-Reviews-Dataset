Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has Rian Johnson ever seen a Star Wars film? He just blew up the franchise. Might have been a decent standalone space film\\, but as a Star Wars film... there's no point going into it. You'll read it in a few weeks when the mainstream press decides to report the truth after a serious dropoff in ticket sales. Bottom line\\, garbage film.","true":true}
