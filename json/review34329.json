Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The average age Star Wars is trying to appeal to has dropped by about 10 years. It's desperate to inject comedy where it doesn't belong\\, exaggerates the power Jedis have\\, and uses ridiculously implausible resolutions to problems the protagonists face. Is saved by a few entertaining scenes and the fact that Kylo Ren and Rey become intriguing characters.\\n\\nI can't imagine how anyone but kids who just got into Star Wars would enjoy this.","true":true}
