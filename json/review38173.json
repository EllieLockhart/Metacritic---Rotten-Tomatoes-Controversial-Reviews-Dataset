Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The tossing of the light saber kills the ending of the force awakens.  Luke made to be a coward until the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Rey over powers Luke the great Jedi Master with a week of training.  Finn and Rose  land right by the 1st Order and live\\, then he drags her across the battle field without being shot.  Leia is now superman.  Purple hair doesn't tell Poe the plans which leads to a mindless side mission to find a substitute code breaker.  This movie was a hot mess.","true":true}
