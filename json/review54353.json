Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how anyone can write any of these plot points down\\, look at them and say \\\"yeah that's a good idea\\\" and then all the executives agree. Terrible betrayal of the franchise and destroys all the characterization from the previous movie combined with the character assassination of Luke- terrible ideas executed badly\\, I have no idea how this was green lit.","true":true}
