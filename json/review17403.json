Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the Last Jedi on Friday...and I wish I hadn't. I wanted to go back into the cinema to see what it was that I missed and why I left feeling so empty and angry. I figured out what was missing...respect. Respect for the legacy and what it meant to so many people. I'm all for reinvention and renewal but not when it is motivated by corporate strategy. Star Wars means something and this movie disrespected and misunderstood that something so badly that I am not sure I want any further part in this franchise. Devastated.","true":true}
