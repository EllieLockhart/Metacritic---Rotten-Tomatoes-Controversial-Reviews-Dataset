Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie! This is My second favourite Star Wars film after The Empire Strikes Back. I know many fans are not happy with how Luke is portrayed but I am loving where the story is going. Looking forward now to episode 9!","true":true}
