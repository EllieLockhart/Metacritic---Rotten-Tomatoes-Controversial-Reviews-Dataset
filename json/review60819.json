Drunkman did a bad job even when he tried to virtue signal. You don't do it THAT obvious.\r\rBut other than these major faults\\, there is no denying that the graphic and gameplay quality is one of the best available at the moment. You can't give it a 0 or 1\\, not even a 3 taking this into the account. As such\\, I will give it a middle rating.\r\rBoth sides should grow up and learn to stop buying into hype\\, stop senseless religious fanboy\/girlism\\, stop bashing for the sake bashing just to look cool in front of your friends. You like the game because of the story? Then you are entitled to be disappointed. But the story is just one part of a game. Same with the side who just worships this game because they want to be contrarians or to kiss up to ND\/Sony. I get it that critics and professionals would suck up to them so that they won't get overlooked by ND\/Sony for future releases\\, but you folks have no such excuse\\, other than sheer stupidity.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
