Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bad storyline really outweigh the good parts compared to all other previous SW movie. Personally I think the books Thrawn Trilogy is better than this Trilogy. What I liked? Chewie trying to eat BBQ alien chicken. I don't understand why this movie is a 6 hour slow chase through open space. Why do they have massive space ships but can't destroy 1 ship or 30 escape shuttles? You would think they would have enough laser canons in battle ships... Or what about boarding craft or tractor beams like in previous films? All star wars movie were adventures through cool looking worlds. Casino World didn't show much. Tatooine was more interesting. Velvet planet was OK. Didn't leave a mark like Hoth or Bespin. Seems like the characters went to the velvet planet only to get out ASAP. It didn't make sense to me that the Resistance was escaping slowly for hours. They were out of firing range in open space? They didn't have asteroids or nebulas or anything else standing in the way... Why did Phasma come back to get killed within 1 minute? They go undercover AGAIN but this time they get caught... But escape again? Nothing new or interesting... Getting caught and escaping is a bit repetitive... Luke says he's not a legend. He's realistic. Is it really realistic for an uncle to think about murdering his nephew? He didn't even kill Vader for being the worst killer in the galaxy. I don't approve Disney. ","true":true}
