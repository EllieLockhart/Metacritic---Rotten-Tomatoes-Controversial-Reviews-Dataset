Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't as good as Empire\\, but then again what is?\\n\\nThe outrage from the hardcore fans is almost understandable\\, but reeks of neckbeards screeching that they didn't get exactly what they wanted.  Yes\\, it breaks from canon (books and animated shows)\\, but it does still have the \\\"epic space opera\\\" feel of the original trilogy.\\n\\nCould some things have been done better?  Sure.  We all have our ideas of what would make the perfect Star Wars film.  Was it a good movie?  Yes.  Without a doubt it was.  \\n\\nIf you're thinking about seeing it\\, ignore the cries of the people who only leave their parent's basement when a new Star Wars film comes out\\, and go enjoy it.","true":true}
