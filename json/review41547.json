Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is essentially a Disney-fied story of the Star Wars universe. Force Awakens was great\\, with a solid story\\, light humor and a feeling of Hope\\, you know\\, that whole underlying notion of the rebellion. Rogue One was a fantastic\\, gritty story that should the sacrifices people have made for the rebellion\\, to stand up and say We will fight you until this oppression stops.  Last Jedi is none of these. The story wanders much like episodes 1-3\\, it relies way too much on humor\\, and though it starts off strong\\, with the exception of one or two points the story is weak.","true":true}
