Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thankfully with social media fans are no longer forced to put up with crap being dumped on them.\\n\\nIt's time studios realized that\\, yes they do need to pay attention to their fan base that has supported these movies for over 40 years. \\n\\nRyan Johnson's movie is an insult to fans.  The plot holes are absolutely massive enough to move several semi's through.  The subplot for fin and a new character were ridiculous and could have been removed without affecting the overall story. \\n\\nThe only way this movie is scoring better than bay watch is that the critics have been paid by Disney.  We've waited 40 years to see the original stars\\, only to have Disney drop their pants and piss on them and by extension us fans.  Do you really think we'll watch any piece of shit called Star Wars.  Think again.  Fans use the only real power you have\\, stay way from this movie and episode IX.  The only thing studio execs understand is the $$$. Don't pay for this movie or the sequels and send a message that we wont accept any crap ?? dumped on us because they slapped a Star Wars label on it.  \\n\\nI can only imagine the board room at Disney where some ass gets up and says we need to make Star Wars\\, fresh\\, hip\\, cool again.  This isn't your dads Star Wars it's all new kill the past.  \\n\\nYeah right\\, piss on the fans and see if Star Wars continues to be a license to print money.  The force isn't that strong.","true":true}
