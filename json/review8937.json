Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fresh. Finally no more hail-mary saves that feel foreseeable and far too easy. Failing is a big theme of the movie\\, as well as legacy. Liked it a lot. Some overdone acting in the beginning and some non-sensical moments\\, but overall a nice pick-up of the plot of TFA.","true":true}
