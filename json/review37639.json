Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The remake that was not a remake? The story has been told before but that does make it a bad thing\\, - The Last Jedi uses a well worked formula\\, one that was first told in 1977 when I was a young lad\\, now I return with my teenage children and they were thrilled as I was all those years ago. For me\\, there was some sadness to be reminded so visually that 40 years have flown by and that life itself is a circle\\, - Luke that was once the student is now the teacher and we naturally favour the student waiting for them to out-perform the master as he (or she) fades away. \\nVisually there is a lot to see in this film\\, - it has taken the series to the next level and I wonder how they will match it next time\\, - but thinking that is a sign of having just watched a great film\\, the film that I have been waiting for since walking out of the cinema in 1977. Unfortunately there were a couple of editing gaffs which could plague a few fans with OCD\\, but for me the next scene came around quickly so I moved on.\\nThe final word\\, - great to see a film that brings the family back to sharing the experience of the cinema.","true":true}
