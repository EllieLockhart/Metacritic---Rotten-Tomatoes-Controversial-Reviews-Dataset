Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete dumpster fire. The tone is set from the very beginning when we see General Hux\\, who was a threatening villain in The Force Awakens\\, reduced to a bumbling clown. Remember the high note The Force Awakens ended on when Rey handed Luke his father's light saber? I can't say I like what happened when he took the light saber\\, but wow were my expectations subverted! So I guess that makes it brilliant?  \\nSpeaking of subverting expectations\\, \\n\\nI think there is a lesson to be learned here\\, and that lesson is thinking twice before handing the reigns of beloved blockbuster franchise like Star Wars over to an indie director.  What Johnson has done is attempt to be bold and deconstruct these legendary and beloved characters.  And the end result is a split of the fan base.\\n\\nEven though Disney and Lucasfilm have made a lot of money from The Last Jedi\\, I have to think the fandom will be less than willing to flock to the theaters to see episode IX multiple times.  I am very surprised the studios chose to go this route.  The script is terribly sloppy and very disrespectful to the original trilogy's characters as well as its fans.  I think and hope the fans show Disney and Lucasfilm their dissatisfaction with their wallets.","true":true}
