Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you ever wanted to watch a movie franchise sell every aspect of itself to a hipster director who's more interested in tearing apart everything that made the franchise great and push woke ideology\\, then step right up. I was extremely disappointed in all aspects of the movie beside the cinematography which was incredible. Just like Venice Beach\\, this movie looks so cool from afar but far from good up close. Apparently also if I don't like this movie then Disney is up the opinion that I am just a bigoted incel. This movie is a perfect representation of our modern times\\, And as such it is cancer to the franchise. Disney will keep telling itself that solo was the reason why Star wars will flop- The lack of introspection is astounding.","true":true}
