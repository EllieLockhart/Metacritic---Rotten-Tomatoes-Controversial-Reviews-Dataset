The game has about the best graphics on ps4 next to red dead redemption 2. The gunplay is fast paced and the enemy AI is more smart than last game unless you mess with the accessibility options\\, the use of the new skill trees are interesting slightly but it\u2019s more of the same as last game you collect supplements for upgrades for both abby and Ellie. So if you enjoyed the last of us 1 gameplay then you will enjoy the gameplay the enemies or infected are a little more intimidating. Where the game goes wrong is it\u2019s story they try to force you to like a character that just is not an enjoyable character not because of the muscles or anything but because they went about the story in the wrong way. I think that if they would have been better off at the very least putting the story in a different order and also gave you a choice at The end of the game but all the characters were so out of character. Joel and Tommy would not have done what they done no matter what they pretty much told abby and her group everything but their blood type. This is where the story fails I had a hard time even finishing the game I played for a good 30 hours  and uninstalled the game twice and am trying to trudge the A second play through just for trophies but it\u2019s probably my least favorite naughty dog game of all time.the end.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
