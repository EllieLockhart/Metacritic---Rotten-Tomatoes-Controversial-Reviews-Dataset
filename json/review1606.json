Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of this franchise i hoped that this movie would at least be decent but unfortunately when i watched this movie i felt my heart falling deeper and deeper from the first 5 minutes to the 10 minutes 30 minutes and so on till the end. This movie has goid cinematography and a good sound score but the story is a let down to the viewers and myself. The plot is ridden in plot holes\\, little to no character payoffs and it is also ridden with stale jokes that would not make anyone laugh. It is simply bad story writing. The most integral part of any star wars movie.","true":true}
