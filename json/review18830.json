Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a mixed bag. Has some good stuff and some really bad stuff.\\n\\nThe first scene with Luke ignores the continuity from the previous movie. Rey is far from Luke and shows his saber. Then in this movie\\, she actually walks and gets close to him.  This is just the beginning of the problems.\\n\\nSecond Act is where things get bad. The movie completely loses himself with its several subplots and even subplots inside subplots. \\n\\nIt gets better in the third act\\, but then the movie is really damaged by this point.\\n\\nThe directing is fine\\, the acting is hit or miss\\, Daisy Ridley got fat ( it's easy to notice ).\\n\\nWriting is where things get bad with this movie. Obviously this isn't a bad movie. It's actually watchable BUT it has way too many flaws to be ignored.\\n\\nI'm still curious about the next one\\, but not excited.","true":true}
