Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's very few new ideas-in fact the scene with the emporer\/head bad guy was almost verbatim from Return of the Jedi! The one prior to this had similar problems-hiding stolen plans in a droid-again! Luke trying to take over the wit and sarcasm of Han Solo does not work-it's not his character. And I for sure could have lived the rest of my life without watching Luke suck the milk out of that dragon creature-Yuck!","true":true}
