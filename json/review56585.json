Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a step backwards for a sequel. At best it is just treading water. It's biggest sin is not progressing it's story. We're in the second act of a three act story... and very little has been done to develop it's main characters in any meaningful way. By the end of it's conclusion you feel cheated because nothing really mattered. \\n\\nNone of the actions of the characters mattered in the grand scheme of the narrative\\, and they are ultimately still  on square one. No different from where we saw them at the end of The Force Awakens. Rey is still the same highly resourceful super capable hero who has no real connection to any other character. Finn is still the cowardly bumbly fool. Poe actually develops a bit\\, but it's... it's really questionable and hard to understand. \\n\\nThe villain is also just as unconvincing as he was in the first entry as well. Kylo hasn't become more menacing. His motivations are still loose at best. They play with some ideas but never commit to anything. \\n\\nIt's a frustrating film to watch if you want to see the story go in some direction. As a Star Wars fan\\, you will probably love the visuals\\, you will love all the throwbacks\\, you will get excited to see those classic characters on the screen\\, but all of that fades away as the credits roll and you start to actually ask questions or you feel a certain emptiness to everything that just took place.","true":true}
