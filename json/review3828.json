Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Big let down. It is the plot of the movie \u201cSpeed\u201d on a spaceship. Doesn\u2019t even move the needle forward with the story or lore of Star Wars. Star Wars movies are timeless\\, this one has an expiration date. It\u2019s worrisome that this director has been charged with writing 10\/11\/12.","true":true}
