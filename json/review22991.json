Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of great action\\, lots of clever banter\\, lots of ingenious use of the universe that's been built by previous films. Solid acting throughout\\, with bursts of brilliance. Amazing visuals. A rich\\, beautiful soundtrack that has John Williams giving us some of his best musical storytelling to date. Plot holes? Sure\\, but what Star Wars film doesn't have those? Some jokes that are a bit too silly or too colloquial? Possibly. Your mileage may vary on that. A version of Luke Skywalker that some people won't like? Yes\\, but I thought it was perfectly done. His interplay with Rey and the fact that he still has a growth arc to fulfill here are both wonderful. No doubt\\, most people can find one thing or another or a lot to criticize. But is this movie outright bad? Absolutely not. The user rating here is a mark of overzealous fandom gone wrong. \\n\\nFans who hate this movie don't understand that Star Wars\\, at its core\\, is about not hating things. That's its whole deal. Hate is bad. If you're indulging your hate here by rating the movie at two or one or zero stars\\, you're giving in to the Dark Side.","true":true}
