Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having been built on a bad foundation with the force awakens here comes a second dose of disappointment.  You sit there for nearly two and a half hours waiting for something good to happen or make sense and it never comes.\\n\\nTo the people that say we are hating it because we are not getting the theories or predictions we wanted they are wrong.  There simply is no explanations to some of the main characters that needed to be followed up and were over looked.  The side quests are just a waste and the new technology is as lame as \\\"star killer base.\\\"\\n\\nIn the time of remakes for movies I hope that this trilogy will be although I guess with the force awakens that would be a remake of a remake.  Sad times for star wars fans.  Disney is just in it for the profits.\\n\\nHelp us George Lucas you're our only hope!","true":true}
