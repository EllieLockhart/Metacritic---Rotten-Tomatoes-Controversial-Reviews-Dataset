Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could do without the Casino planet bit but the rest of the movie was great. I wasn't expecting anything and didn't have any fan fiction laid out in my head for 30 years so I wasn't disappointed by anything they did with the characters. I do think we should have known a bit more about Snoke and hopefully they will explore the Knights of Ren in the next film.","true":true}
