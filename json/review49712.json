Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Writer\/Director Rian Johnson said he couldn't have written Luke any other way??? Is that a joke? Any moron with a half a brain could have spent a day writing a better and more fitting story for our favorite Star Wars hero. If this is all he could come up with then perhaps he should have stepped aside and let someone who was up to the task do it.","true":true}
