Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just adding my 2 cents after all the bad reviews from fans and audiences. This is the first Star Wars movie I came out of not being assured of myself to come back and watch the second time. As others said\\, it is disappointing. I don't need to watch twice to be disappointed twice. Too bad that Johnson and Disney missed a golden opportunity on a story like no other\\, and instead made a complete fool of the story line. This \\\"Last Jedi\\\" movie is nothing like about the Jedi and did not protect the legacy of Luke Skywalker's character that made SW simply amazing. There's too much Hollywood directors and writers wanting to twist and change story lines themselves much like what DC did with Superman\\, Justice League\\, etc. Ruined the characters and the story when there are a lot of better story tellers out there\\, proven unlike your own radicalization of characters. Good luck JJ on SW IX. Growing up with SW and owning collectibles and everything SW\\, I would line up to fans who are now having second thoughts about Episode 9.","true":true}
