Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely bloody awful. This movie breaks Star Wars. Do not watch\\, for so many reasons. I can't even start to describe why this movie is so bad in terms of story telling and in terms of Star Wars lore. Check out Last Jedi reviews on YouTube and judge for yourself. Half a star for the music being good\\, and it looking like Star Wars\\, so long as you don't think about anything that's happening or why any of it is happening. I'm done with Star Wars. Disney\\, you done f*cked it up. Boo.","true":true}
