Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Incredibly beautiful game. The graphics and game play are just as good\\, if not better than the first one. The story pushes boundaries that we aren\u2019t comfortable with. The world of The Last of Us is brutal and unforgiving. To think that Joel wouldn\u2019t face any consequences after his actions in the conclusion of the first game is ridiculous. He slaughtered dozens of people as well as murdered the only person who could make a vaccine. Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, Joel is my favorite and I\u2019d love for him to have had a happier ending\\, but I\u2019m also not naive in thinking that just because he is a main character he is invincible. The dual story lines is something that helps put you in the perspective of everyone involved. Abby had just as much validation for her actions as Joel did for his. The representation of LGBTQ+ characters is also something I personally feel is amazing. Anyone who discredits these characters because of their sexual orientation has no right to play this game and are unwanted in this fan base. Do not let early leaks of this game deter you from the fact that it is incredible. Play the game for yourself before forming an opinion\\, don\u2019t just go off of what some bitter strangers on the internet said.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
