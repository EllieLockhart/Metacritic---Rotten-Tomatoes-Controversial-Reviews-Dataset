Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe how disappointing this film was. The plots were silly\\, the characters were out of place\\, too many (not particularity funny) attempts at humor. All this ruins the continuity set up by the previous films. In short\\, it does not seem like a Star Wars film\\, particularity a main saga film. I can see them \\\"changing things up\\\" for their \\\"Star Wars Story\\\" franchise\\, but the main saga should at least feel like a SW film.","true":true}
