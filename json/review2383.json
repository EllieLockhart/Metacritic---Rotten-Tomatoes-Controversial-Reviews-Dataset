Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Audience reviews don\u2019t lie...Like most my age who grew up and have transitioned the love of this franchise from my childhood to my children\\, I am sad to say that this movie ended my Star Wars saga. Disney has overplayed its hand and it's having a severe backlash...count me out moving forward until they start letting good directors in.","true":true}
