Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very good movie\\, definitely a huge improvement from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" (which was basically a copy of \\\"A New Hope.\\\" Definitely recommend it. It takes more a lot more risks and definitely has a plot of its own with multiple twists. There are a couple of things that happen that don't exactly make a lot of sense and annoying things in the plot both new and left over from \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" but overall a really good movie.\\n\\nDefinitely an overhated movie.","true":true}
