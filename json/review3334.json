Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being an avid Star Wars fan from the beginning\\, I knew 5 minutes in I was not going to like this one. I tried really hard to look for something redeeming\\, but thelonger it went on the more annoyed I became. I can picture arguments in the back room between Disney and the Director\/Writers with Disney winning of course. I'm having a hard time thinking of this crap as \\\"Star Wars\\\" as it doesn't feel the same and the story line  and characters are just not that interetsing.","true":true}
