Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wanted to like it\\, so many plot holes might has well been swiss cheese. \\nmost characters where so bland that i only know a couple of their names.\\nbad comedy that felt so forced every 5 seconds. \\nkilled admiral Ackbar off screen.\\nSnoke plot line ended horribly.\\noverall the only thing that can make it worse would be if they added jar-jar binks.\\nit did have great acting and looked beautiful with some side plots that was really interesting but it was a bad movie but even a worse starwars movie.","true":true}
