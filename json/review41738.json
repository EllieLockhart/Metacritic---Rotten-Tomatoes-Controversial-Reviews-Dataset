Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't just a bad 'Star Wars' film\\, it is an example of poor writing and what happens when you disregard the source material. For the record\\, I loved 'Force Awakens\\,' and it set this film up beautifully. However\\, at every turn Johnson decided to disregard the groundwork that was laid for him in 'Force Awakens.' \\n\\nThere are so many plot holes and continuity errors that it took me a few days to think of them all. Entire subplots go nowhere and after thinking about how Episode IX is set up\\, I honestly do not care about the final film. \\n\\nIt doesn't ruin 'Star Wars\\,' nor is it the worst\\, but it will take a long time to get over just how frustrating this film is.","true":true}
