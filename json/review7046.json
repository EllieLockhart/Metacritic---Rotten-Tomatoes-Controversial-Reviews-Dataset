Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"EDIT: The hype can blind you. - I wrote this the same night I saw it.\\nOn reflection about this movie\\, it's blatantly terrible.\\n\\nI saw a review in the newspaper for this movie the morning of the day I went to see it.\\nThe review said it was the best Star Wars movie ever. They had finally done it\\, after 40 years.\\n This movie lived up to that hype. It's extremely good.\\n (I now have a new favorite all-time movie. Sorry HttyD 2...)","true":true}
