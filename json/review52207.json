Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this I have to wonder if Rian Johnson has ever even seen a Star Wars film before? I don\u2019t even have a lot of faith in episode VX based on what Johnson left Abrams to work with. It\u2019s like he intentionally went out of his way to destroy the very essence of what made the Star Wars universe so special. He made the \u201cold guard\u201d hero\u2019s look inept and weak. And I get it\u2019s more of a \u201cpassing the torch\u201d type of film but the portrayal of Luke was horrible. Just a huge let down. ","true":true}
