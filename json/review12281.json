Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure what to say\\,  I will not go into major details in case you have not seen the movie and do not want to be spoil.  The Movie looks great and the Music is also very good overall.  The story for me is just very weak.  I do know this movie was being written during TFA and JJ just now pitch the story for Episode 9. So i have to think that with no overarching plan for these movies is one of the reasons for a weak story.","true":true}
