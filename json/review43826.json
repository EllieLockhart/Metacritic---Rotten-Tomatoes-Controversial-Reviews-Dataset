Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This whole film felt pointless. Characters don't grow or progress and if you had any doubt that Rey was a Mary-Sue this film confirms it tenfold. \\n\\nOh and if you like Lukes character or Leia\\, be prepared to cringe.\\n\\nVisually nice\\, but when your characters are bad\\, character growth is nonexistent\\, story lacks any interest then it's like buying a really huge dimond. Pretty\\, but untimitly a waste of money because it does nothing.","true":true}
