Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson should be sacked from Disney with immediate effect and never be allowed anywhere near a Star Wars film again. I have been a Star Wars fan for my entire life and I've never hated a film so much. Disney have let down the fans and let down our heroes. How this film got a green light to be made is beyond me. Although this film is filled with some amazing CGI and some cool fight scenes it didn't feel like a Star Wars film in the slightest. Hollow plot lines that go nowhere and zero character development. The film Felt More Like spaceballs 2 them a Star Wars film. Nothing more than a slap in the face from someone that clearly hates the franchise. You can shove this film up your ass.","true":true}
