Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The anticipation for this sequel was high\\, and many people thought this one would focus on the roots of The Jedi \u201creligion\u201d. Instead\\, the movie is an utter mess. Hamill\u2019s overacting is hard to watch\\, and them there is the scene of Leia flying through space lime Mary Poppins. Only two characters are worth watching: Kylo Ren and Poe Dameron. Finn and Rey are just awful to watch. ","true":true}
