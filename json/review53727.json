Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Glorious visuals and good acting cannot save a painfully bad script. After the well received Rouge One\\, I had high hopes that the franchise could be brought back into the sun after the terrible prequel trilogy and the been-there-done-that of The Force Awakens\\, but it was not to be. \\nThe movie suffer from ham-fisted attempts at humor that fall flat and unintentionally laughably ridiculous scenes (yes Mary Poppins\\, I speak of you). After the throne room betrayal\\,  it became clear that the movie was determined to use swerves rather than thoughtful storytelling to forward the plot. I half expected the whole thing to be just a dream by the end\\, and to my eye-rolling and incredulous disappointment it essentially was. Add to that a 30 minute videogame style quest that goes nowhere\\, a gleeful book burning Nazi Yoda (I understand the desire to start fresh\\, but that was a tad on-the-nose)\\, and the marvelous build up of Luke as a hopeless figure only to have him change his mind for no real reason other than to have an epic showdown (another swerve) and had this been any other franchise\\,  the critics would have panned the sloppy storytelling and inconsistencies.\\nThat being said\\, why did the critics give it such praise? Two possible reasons. 1) They graded on a curve. The Star Wars franchise has had some ups and downs (with the downs being rather dismal) and rather than view it as a standard movie\\, they said 'For a Star Wars movie\\, it wasn't that bad'. 2) Fear. Given Disney's rather draconian treatment of criticism lately\\, no one was willing to risk their wrath by calling a tent pole franchise a turd. Also\\, fear of the fanboy reaction to calling yet another Star Wars movie a poor job (which is ironic in hindsight)\\nAll the bad press in the world will not stop this movie from being a billion dollar juggernaut\\,  but all the money it makes cannot force this movie into being good.","true":true}
