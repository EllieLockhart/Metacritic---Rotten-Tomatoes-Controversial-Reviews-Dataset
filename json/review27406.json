Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outside of 'Attack of the Clones' this was the most disappointing Star Wars film\\, in my opinion.  \\nFirst\\, we have Snoke who has really not been mentioned before\\, but now is in charge of everything?  OK was left wondering on that.\\nNext\\, with Carrie Fisher no longer with us\\, they missed a chance to write Leia out of the film.  Instead there was a convoluted and unnecessary \\\"recovery\\\" in space to survive and return to the ship?\\nI was less-than-impressed with Mark Hammill's acting performance\\, I mean can we now see why he basically hasn't worked in 40 years?\\nFinally\\, not sure why Star Wars writers\/producers insist on the Empire always having some *one* glaring vulnerability for the Rebellion to go after.  Like the tracker\\, they only have ONE?  Seems like they would have an unlimited budget based on the staggering amount of ships\\, equipment and personnel they have\\, but that is where they cheap out?\\nFor that matter\\, why is the Empire so lacking in any kind of tactical skills?  I mean\\, one ship attacking at the end\\, with no other ones anywhere to be found just in case an escape is made?\\nAnd why did they insist on adding the \\\"cutesie\\\" little Porgs in the most annoying way?  OK I get they're trying to maybe hold little kids' attention or work on fattening up the film's merchandising potential\\, but didn't have to lay it on so thick with those things.\\nI don't deny there weren't some good moments\\, the special effects were on-point as always.  But overall this one really did not grab me as others have.","true":true}
