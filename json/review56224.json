Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Ex Machina\\n\\nIf you are a casual moviegoer or child\\, you will enjoy this film. If you are a cinephile or true star wars fan you will not..\\n\\nThis movie has great visuals and hints of greatness here and there. However\\, the script\\, humor\\, and pacing is very poor.\\n\\nToo many forced jokes\\, a lot of plot holes\\, and uses of ex machina's to save the main characters. Everything set up in TFA turns to nothing and anti-climactic. It's okay to do this for one plot point\\, but when it is every single one it's bad.\\n\\nThis movie attempts to be too non-conformist from past star wars that is falls on its face. Feels a lot like a marvel\/transformers mash up.","true":true}
