Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroys everything the Force Awakens sets up.  It is like the director said \\\"Screw the last movie\\, I'm gonna wreck this soooo bad\\, no one will ever be able to redeem the third film.\\\"\\n\\nToo much influence from SJWS.  This movie is the result of liberal politics vomiting on the Star Wars franchise\\, and expecting us to lap it up like the best tasting thing we have seen set before us.","true":true}
