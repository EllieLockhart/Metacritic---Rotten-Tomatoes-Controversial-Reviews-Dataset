Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely phenomenal film. Rian Johnson's vision for this episode takes Star Wars into a place it has yet to go before. It challenges the audience to question accepted truths in Jedi lore and the Star Wars universe overall. It's different\\, it's exciting\\, and it's certainly not a copy of Empire. I shave off half a star only because the arc with Finn and Rose was unnecessary and ultimately would have shaved off a needed 20 minutes of film.","true":true}
