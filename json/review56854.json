Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no way that Luke Skywalker would even consider murdering his nephew. Luke risked his life to destroy the original death star for the sake of the rebellion and the galaxy. Luke risked giving up being a Jedi just to go try to save his friends at Cloud City. Luke was wiling to die on the second death star just to have the chance to redeem his father. Luke was always about hope and faith and doing the right thing. It's absurd and ludicrous that he would even contemplate murdering his nephew\\, let alone raise his saber to the sleeping and unarmed Ben Solo. Come on\\, man. There's so many other rancid story beats in this movie\\, but that is the worst. It is unforgivable.","true":true}
