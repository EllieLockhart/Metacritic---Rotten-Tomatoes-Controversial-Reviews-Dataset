Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pitiful disgrace to the franchise. Worse than episode II. Don't trust the critic reviews. i suspect they are either liars or idiots. Wait for this to come out on Hulu or something. Movie is way to long and poorly paced. Waste your money and time on something else.","true":true}
