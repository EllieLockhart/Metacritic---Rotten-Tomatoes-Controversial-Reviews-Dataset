Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's epic Star Wars film doesn't fail to entertain. The Last Jedi does have some flaws\\, but it's still an enjoyable\\, surprising\\, and original Star Wars film. There are so many unexpected\\, yet emotional plot twists in this film. The character development in this film is strong\\, as you can see each character face their own challenges\\, and learn about topics they've never touched before. Despite this\\, there are some flaws. Finn's subplot lacked\\, as it didn't feel like Star Wars. It felt too politically similar to Earth. The idea of introducing heroines are great\\, but don't introduce too many. The Last Jedi does. Despite this\\, The Last Jedi contains the best action\\, and visuals a Star Wars movie has ever seen\\, emotional plot twists\\, and is just so fun to watch and enjoy.","true":true}
