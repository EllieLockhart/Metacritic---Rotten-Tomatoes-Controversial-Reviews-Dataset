Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are moments in this movie that I love\\, there are some that missed for me. Expands the mythology of the force in ways we have not seen before. All of the acting was top notch. A few sequences that feel misplaced but there some very iconic Star wars moments. The movie took alot of risks some really payed off others missed a bit\\, but glad that the movie attempted the risks that it did.","true":true}
