Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice work Stephen! This one took me back to the first one that came out. I'm getting used to the new characters and don't miss the originals as much. This chapter did a great job further integrating them into the storyline. A must see.","true":true}
