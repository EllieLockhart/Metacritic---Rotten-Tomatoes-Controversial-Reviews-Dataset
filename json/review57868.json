Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"well\\, the cinematography was good but most everything else was quite disappointing. the moment luke throws the lightsaber off the cliff I knew I wasn't going to like the direction they went with luke in this movie. I was really looking forward to seeing how luke would play out in this film and they basically just make him out to be cynical and wanting nothing to do with the jedi or wanting to help in anyway. that's not luke skywalker at all.  Nothing at all interesting happens in the plot. Its basically just the new order vs the resistance and that's pretty much it. nothing clever going on. the bad guys shoot and the good guys shoot back for 2 and a half hours. that's the main plot. None of the characters develop in this movie except you figure out that reys parents were nobody special\\, and that kylo ren just had darkness inside him all along so I guess he's just evil just because. I really hope J.J Abrams can put this on the right track again because this movie was really disappointing to me. Im a fan of the novels and ive pretty much read all the main book series\\, so its even more disappointing with how many great ideas they could borrow from.","true":true}
