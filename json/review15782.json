Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love how the user score says 49% when anyone with a brain-cell can see its far lower. Rotten Tomatoes is FAKE!\\n\\n\\\"Come back George Lucas!
