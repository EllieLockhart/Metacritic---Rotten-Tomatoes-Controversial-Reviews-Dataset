Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot was very forced and made little sense.  The waste of Luke Skywalker was a shame.  The final space scene with the attack of the Order's ship was visually impressive\\, but the rest of the movie is not really work watching.  Skip this if you have the choice.","true":true}
