Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. I loved the direction it went in with Luke. I think what everyone wanted was Luke to train Rey just like what has happened in the past films. This direction made way more sense with the direction they want to go. It showed a broken Luke who was hiding from his mistakes instead of learning from them. Rian Johnson made a film that was unlike the previous films and it worked. Mark Hamill even said he did not get it at first until he watched it and said I get it and like it. I do not get all the hate this has gotten from fans. You need to walk in with an open mind and realize what you think will happen does not happen\\, but that is not a bad thing.","true":true}
