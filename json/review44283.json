Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long\\, with lots of fat that needed to be trimmed. Johnson's take is not as good or as re-watchable as The Force Awakens. Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill deliver amazing performances. Mark should receive an award for his layered performance. However\\, the villains are weak and we really learn nothing about the First Order\\, Kylo Ren is just as whiny as Anakin from original trilogy. Do not agree with many of the choices Johnson and Disney have made here. Not excited about Johnson's future trilogy. The movie is okay\\, but not great. Several problems. I am not saying do not go see it\\, see it for Hamill's performance and the last performance of Carrie. Just don't buy into the critic hype. If you are a true Star wars fan you will be a little disappointed.","true":true}
