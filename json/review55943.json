Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson pulls off a hell of trick with the The Last Jedi. It answers all questions\\, it blows up the mythology\\, but it does so by saying \u201cnone of that is important\u201d. The trick is that having realized what he has done you feel like you should be infuriated...but your not. You feel a bit odd about it perhaps\\, but no sense of loss. In way there really are no spoilers for this film\\, because nothing happens the way you might imagine. It is a narrative hand grenade. At the end the new cast is completely free to go in any direction without having to pull the weight of what has gone before. It is entertaining\\, but it will play with your expectations.
