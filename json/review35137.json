Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a good movie.  it wasn't a great movie but it had a lot of lost ground to cover and it left us with a lot of questions.  if you're hoping to have those questions answered by #thelastjedi .... you're going to have a bad time.  Want to know who and where and how Snoke came to be?  nope.  Want to know more about the knights of ren?  nope.  Want to know about what happened with luke and his students and his vision for the new Jedi order?  forget it.  Want to know who reys parents were and how she ended up on jakku?? not so much.  This movie not only didn't address the questions from episode  7\\, it did nothing to address the time in between 6 and now.. didn't provide anything we haven't seen before and even went so far as to have a \\\"hoth battle\\\" on salt instead of snow... different vehicles but same situation.  overall this movie was a big disappointment for me and for those that follow the canon this is going to be a difficult sit.","true":true}
