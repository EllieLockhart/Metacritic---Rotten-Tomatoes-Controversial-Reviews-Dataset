Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars just ran out of fuel..\\n\\nBefore the movie I was watching people come out of the imax cinema\\, and 90% looked depressed or bewildered. Compared to the smiling faces that emerged from Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, the change was clearly noticeable.\\n\\nI won't belabour the same negative points raised consistently in these reviews - \\nterrible meaningless story\\, \\nnegating the intriguing plot lines established in Force Awakens\\, \\ntransforming Luke into a grumpy wet paper bag of a character\\, \\nthen killing him literally with a puff of thin air\\, \\nkilling snoke \/ phasma without any character development\\, \\nLeia flying through space without a suit\\, \\ntoo many slapstick CGI puppets (probably the only part Lucas would like) that trivialise the spiritual aspects of the original trilogy\\, \\nRey's parentage anti-climax\\, \\nBB8 shooting casino coins\\, \\nthe Maz holograph scene where she has a conversation while in the middle of battle\\, \\nthe strange 'save the horses' subplot (seriously wtf)\\, \\nyoda giggling with his legs wriggling around (so out of character) \\nand many\\, many other examples of bad script and plot holes that went nowhere.\\n\\nThe good: Filming was awesome\\, as was the CGI and sound. Visuals couldn't be better\\, and in imax 3D it looked unbelievable. The opening scene with Poe in his Xwing was incredible - he's a good actor - and Carrie was fantastic too despite her space walk. Kylo and Rey also acted well despite the poor script - they did their best with what they had.\\n\\nBut give me a solid story and character development over visual effects any day - I'm sad to say this movie has pushed the Star Wars saga back a step\\, and has done a lot of harm to our beloved heroes. I only hope Jar Jar Abrams can restore the hope that was lost .. there is another..","true":true}
