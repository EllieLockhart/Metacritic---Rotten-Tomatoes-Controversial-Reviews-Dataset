Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Firstly let me start by saying that this is a NO-SPOILER review. \\n\\nI am a huge star wars fans\\, unashamedly so. Why I love this film so much  is that it combines several plot lines and creates a cohesive story that advances old and new characters into a very unique story within a galaxy far far and away. \\n\\nfor me what this film does is answers the main question I wanted to know\\, How powerful is Luke Skywalker? NO spoilers here but it doesn't disappoint.","true":true}
