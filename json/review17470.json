Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this was recieving a lot of conflicted reviews. Just wanted to say I thought this was a masterpiece. Having been a star wars fan my entire life I have loved seeing its rise again. The Last Jedi told a fun story\\, had beautiful visuals\\, expanded the star wars universe\\, and took a new turn for the star wars universe. Yes some of the humor was unnecessary\\, there were some plot holes or unnecessary scenes. But to read reviews that say this was the worst star wars movie made is absolutely absurd.","true":true}
