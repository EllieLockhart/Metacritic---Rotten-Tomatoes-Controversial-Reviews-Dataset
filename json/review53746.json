Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good night to the Star Wars I remember from my youth.  This is not entirely because a key character was killed off but instead because it breaks from what I consider to be some of the CORE anchoring storylines I have always enjoyed.  One - the bloodline of the Jedi. Two - Kylo ditching the helmet.  Three - the over the top humor.  Four - the Ben (now without the helmet) and Rey's telepathic phone calls to each other.  Five - Rey quick (no training) mastery of to control the force... I'll stop there.  Maybe it's my fault for assuming it would rise to what Empire was after and exciting The Force Awakens and the amazing Rogue One thriller.  If the goal was to divorce the series from the fb base that built the legend then mission accomplished.  Sure one would argue that Disney is trying to attract a whole new audience but in a crowded genre competing for the audience against The Avengers (Marvel for example)\\, The Last Jedi as a stand alone movie wouldn't be able to compete.  Sadly the next Star Wars movie I see will probably be on a flight to somewhere\\, available for free.  Star Wars is dead\\, long live the Origin Story Films!","true":true}
