Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie may have just killed all hope I had in Star Wars being owned by Disney. I see why Mark Hamill said he wished Disney would have incorporated more of George Lucas ideas in the film. No way to sugar coat this one\\, it was just bad!","true":true}
