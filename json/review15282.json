Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like the movie but had some problems with it the first time seeing it. Then I went home and thought about it a lot and then went to go see it again.  And \\nI have to say I loved it the second viewing.  So many missed layers that I could appreciate so much more.","true":true}
