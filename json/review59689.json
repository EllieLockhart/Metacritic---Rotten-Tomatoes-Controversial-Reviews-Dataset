Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is the biggest disappointment during my whole gamelife. We didn't wait for this. Gameplay\\, graphics and etc. are pretty good\\, not on the top level\\, but good. And the main problem isn't Neil's desire to please leftists. The main problem is the story\\, the plot\\, it's so bad\\, so disappointing\\, but first of all - it's not even close to the First part. Second half of the game... It was very-very difficult to make fans feel something good to Abby\\, killer of Joel! And all this stuff with Dogs and Scars\\, with these children. Maybe this is not bad\\, but this is not The Last of Us\\, this is not Our Story\\, and of course this is not interesting to us\\, fans. I didn't feel any emotion during playing as Abby. And why we playing as Abby and trying to kill Ellie\\, just why??? It's awful... Next\\, the ending. It can't compare with the ending of the First part. Just compare your emotions... The First part is better in any aspect\\, the MAIN MENU\\, the SOUNDTRACK\\, the STORY\\, the ENDING! Naughty Dog could create magnificent story\\, there was big space to create\\, but they'd preferred to break our hearts\\, fans hearts.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
