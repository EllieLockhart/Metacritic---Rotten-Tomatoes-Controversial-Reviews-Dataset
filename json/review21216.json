Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the movie with lower expectations as i disliked TFA. What i disliked were all the lose ends which were completely ignored. You have story lines which were intentionally distroyed (Snoke)\\, Luke who tried to save Darth Vader (who killed millions of people) is trying to kill Ben because he hangs out with the wrong people (Snoke)? You have Leia flying through space and a bomber is 'dropping' bombs and so on. A lot of stuff doesn't make sense at all. The fight scene in the throne room was good. That's why the movie gets a 1+ star.","true":true}
