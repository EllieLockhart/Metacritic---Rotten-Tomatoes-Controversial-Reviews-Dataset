{"101487":121418,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First things first: if this had not been sold to me as a continuation of the Star Wars saga\\, I would be much more generous and have given 2.5 stars. But because it not only claims to be Star Wars but fails so spectacularly at being Star Wars\\, especially a Saga film\\, I will give it the lowest score possible. Because I was promised Star Wars and Rian Johnson\\, Lucasfilm\\, and Disney completely failed to deliver. And because of how horrific that failure was\\, I demand that The Last Jedi be struck from the canon entirely and that Rian Johnson be fired and barred from working on any Star Wars projects from now on.\\n\\nI will say that I was spoiled early for the movie before I ended up watching it. When one is spoiled\\, there are two relatively desirable outcomes - either one says \\\"Damn it I wish I saw that for myself\\\" or \\\"Wow\\, I really need to see that now.\\\" Both are good signs for the movie. Neither is what I felt.\\n\\nInstead\\, I dreaded watching this. I had already made plans for it and suddenly I wish I hadn't. I wished I could back out of this without spoiling for my friends and family. The most I could do was warn them that this has the lowest audience rating ever in the franchise and it's only the 9th day out.\\n\\nFor the record\\, I HAVE seen the movie. And\\, while my brain did the natural thing and had jumped to the worst possible conclusions regarding the spoilers\\, my fears and suspicions WERE in fact proven correct.\\n\\n1st: Basic storytelling 101 - Your protagonists must achieve something by their actions. Honestly\\, that's a 3 star deduction right there for failing to abide by such a basic rule. I don't know who taught Rian Johnson how to write\\, but he clearly failed to learn this.\\n\\n2nd: Disregard for other parts of the franchise - Rian Johnson and the Lucasfilm Story Group that allowed this movie to exist completely ignored characterizations established in previous installations in the lore. I want to make this clear: The Last Jedi is not and never has been a standalone movie. It is a movie situated in a given franchise which provides it with its context. When that context is disregarded\\, then the media fails as a part of that franchise.\\n\\na) Luke Skywalker - Side note: TFA is guilty of this as well\\, but was otherwise a good movie. TLJ completely disregards Luke \\\"I have to save my mass murdering father\\\" Skywalker's characterization in Return of the Jedi. Do you seriously expect me to believe that he would pull his lightsaber on his own nephew? TLJ completely fails to set up or justify this change of character and expects me to believe that this is the Luke Skywalker I have come to love. If you plan on appealing to our nostalgia for the original trilogy\\, I will punch you if you end up spitting on it. Consider yourself punched\\, Rian.\\n\\nAlso\\, all this talk about romanticizing the Jedi? Luke Skywalker succeeded in turning Darth Vader because he knowingly defied the Jedi. Do your basic research\\, Rian.\\n\\nb) Finn - Are you really going to call Finn\\, the man who at risk of his own life 1) disobeyed a direct order to fire on innocents\\, 2) freed a Resistance pilot and defected\\, 3) repeatedly saved Rey\\, and even went into the heart of Starkiller Base to do so\\, SELFISH and COWARDLY?!\\n\\nc) Rey - You're expecting me to believe that a woman who grew up alone with every reason to be distrustful of people around her who may mean her harm would sympathize with the man who kidnapped\\, assaulted\\, and tortured her\\, invaded her mind - an act analogous to rape - killed his own father\\, a man Rey was growing to care about as a father figure\\, nearly killed Finn\\, the man who lied to the Resistance in order to come back for Rey. Do you really want our kids to think that the relationship between Rey and Kylo is something to emulate? Do we really want them chasing after the people who hurt them and have no interest in becoming better?\\n\\nd) Poe Dameron - None of his characterization in the comics and especially the Force Awakens justify the characterization here of hot-headed\\, reckless\\, glory-seeking to the point that he doesn't care about the entire bomber squadron that just died. It's not simply a different interpretation\\, it's WRONG. It is completely in error and in opposition to everything previously established. And his interactions with Leia and Holdo are extremely racist\\, especially when Holdo condescends to him\\, fails to communicate with him\\, and expects blind obedience - that characterization\\, by the way\\, would fit an Imperial\/First Order type than a Rebel\/Resistance member. Or has Lucasfilm completely forgotten the point of Star Wars?\\n\\ne) Chewbacca - The film completely fails to utilize him\\, especially since his BEST FRIEND JUST DIED! Let me repeat: his best friend\\, Han Solo\\, was murdered by his son. You expect me to believe he'd just go along with Rey's absurd plan? He's relegated to glorified taxi driver and comedy.\\n\\n3rd) Sidelining the characters of color to develop and sympathize with an entitled fascist white boy. None of the main characters - including Rey - are actually developed here. Rose Tico was created a) to make Finn look completely incompetent and b) to keep him away from Rey\\, with whom he had an incredible dynamic with in TFA\\, all so Rey could grow to sympathize with the a white fascist.\\n\\n4th) The infantilizing of grown men. Poe's and Kylo's arcs are meant for teens\/young adults but are given to people in their 30s. Let me repeat: Kylo Ren is not a boy; he is a fully grown adult who partakes in slavery and genocide. Poe Dameron is not a hotshot pilot who is new to his job: he is one of the most experienced members of the Resistance\\, a former member of the Republic navy\\, and an officer. You don't get to the rank of Commander with Rian's portrayal of foolhardiness.\\n\\n5th) Inability to stick to a consistent message. It expects us to believe that we have hope and yet dashes our hopes at every turn. No one comes to the Resistance's aid. Luke Skywalker is now just a myth just thirty years after Endor. You expect me to believe that this one event that cost him his life will sustain the galaxy when just witnessed by a dozen people?\\n\\nThis is a complete mess of a film. You marketed it to Star Wars fans and gave us something that goes against every value Star Wars had.","true":true}
