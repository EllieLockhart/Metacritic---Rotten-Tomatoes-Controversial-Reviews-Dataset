Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So Essentially Luke goes from being our beloved\\, unmovable moral Hero to a washed up failure for a teacher\\, tries to murder his own nephew because he had \u2018dark thought.' He helped a little\\, and then killed himself... GREAT LEGACY\\, way to go Disney\\, you killed it for me. I'm done Star Wars\\, I'm done.","true":true}
