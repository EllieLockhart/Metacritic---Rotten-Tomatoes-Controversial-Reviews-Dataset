Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has a few good scenes\\, but for each 3 worse ones. Very inconsistent and so many scenes that are jaw dropping for all the wrong reasons. This is movie is comprable to Episode 2 from the prequel trilogy in terms of structure. In terms of story this is the worst Star Wars to date. Way worse than Rogue one and worse than force awakens.","true":true}
