Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RJ is a Franchise Killer\\nHow did Disney release this? It was an epic fail on so many levels - the Jedi and Force\\, as well as the \\\"feel\\\" of the Star Wars Universe were what made the series great. RJ Killed off or ignored much of it. The movie didn't have the feel of a SW movie. Almost left the movie theater several times. Shame on you Disney","true":true}
