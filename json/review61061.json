We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Story :\rThe emotions and images established by Joel in the previous work are completely destroyed. Joel and Tommy who had survived in the harsh environment for years is willing to trust strangers\\, To the full extend of giving their full name when they know Joel has a lot of enemies is illogical. I personally do not mind Joel being killed but the way where he was killed make it a cheap death for a character that we had so much love in the previous work.\r\rAbby as someone who had seek for revenge for years willing to let the rest of them go dint make sense. She did not consider that there are revenge possibility or think that their group is too powerful for someone to have any possibility of revenge capability. Being The passerby who killed our favorite character she absorbed all the hatred and become the most hated character in game. Yet we are forced to play as the killer trying to establish some form of empathy and sympathy as a player for this character.\r\rLastly\\, Ellie who lost everything in the end\\, her capability to play the guitar that was her link to Joel. Losing her loved ones for the act of last revenge. She knew what She is going for when  she decided to go\\,  and yet giving up on revenge on the very last minute after killing all the people in the game?  This is punishing to play as the player\\, we should be given the choice if we wanted to kill Abby.\r\rGameplay : Basically Same as last generation\u2026 Expand","true":true}
