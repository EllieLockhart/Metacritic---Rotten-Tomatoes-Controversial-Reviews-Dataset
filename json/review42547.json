Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was another good (but not great) installment in the franchise. Where The Force Awakens failed in giving the audience a unique  SW experience\\, The Last Jedi thrives in this area. While the positives and negatives for both movies in the new trilogy mirror each other\\, The Last Jedi excites this movie goer because of its audacity and bold character choices. While the direction doesn't necessarily mesh well with the previous episode\\, it takes the series in an exciting new direction where anyone can be a Jedi just how it felt in 1979.","true":true}
