Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some spoilers: I liked force awakens but OMG this movie was bad. Gareth Edwards in Rogue One seemed to know what he was doing and Disney crapped on him\\, this new guy has know clue nor does Disney. Star Wars has died for me\\, I didn't think that was possible\\, I didn't even hate the prequals this badly...\\n\\nI don't hate the movie because it's different\\, I dislike it because from the opening scrawl it makes no sense in relation to what has already happened and where the movie starts. And if this is supposed to be weeks\/months after we left off it makes even less sense....Within the the first few seconds of the live action part the movie is turned into some parody which also doesn't make sense because the new order is trying to strike as quickly as possible but no\\, now we got to stop to talk and introduce some preschool humor? Ignore the fact fighters aren't deployed then there is a bunch of luck this happen\\, lucky that happened\\, luck that that happened type of sequences which again comes off as preschool story telling.\\n\\nI also don't get how people are saying that this movie was original and different\\, half the movie is is retread ideas from the previous movies and is done more poorly.\\n\\nMost of the character development is sloppy or just craps on the previous characters history.\\nThought Kylo Ren\/Luke had strong performances for what they had to work with.\\n\\nThe ending also doesn't make a lot of sense with the broom kid (I'm not even going to get into the mess before that)\\, unless I missed something all the now renamed rebels because the resistance name was dropped by the end (but I'm not sure what they are rebels off at this point) where running away to save their lives\\, so what story was there to tell.  And they magically heard the story in captivity within seconds of it happening? \\n\\nLet's not forget the peter pan scene that breaks rules\/laws of the world created by past authors\/directors\/Lucas. I can tolerate it in a cartoon\\, but for the live action movie it's not really tolerable. Lets say that I want to suspend my disbelief\\, everyone else was evaporated except her?\\nI got that space would eventually kill them but then were is the selflessness to save others or at least see them pass away? There is more then one named character\\, some of them famous that up and vanish in explosions with basically no mention there after\\, and they barely mentioned them before that too\\, let alone show them.\\n\\nI don't mind who Rey's parents are\\, I do mind that they basically don't delve into how she feels about that. In comparison you find out about Luke's parents\\, there is denial\\, then some resignation in later scenes\\, here they just tell you and move on. So who is the story\/protagonist\/antagonist supposed to be\\, the story seems to be about no one or about nothing other then there is two sides who don't like each other for some reason which is never properly explained over the course of two movies now (I'll give a pass to Force Awakens because they layed the ground work and this movie just ignores it still)\\n\\nI get what Disney and the director were trying to do throughout the movie\\, it's just so poorly done I don't imagine how it made it out of a prescreening or edit session.","true":true}
