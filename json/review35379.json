Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi abandons every good storyline established in The Force Awakens and leaves avid Star Wars fans in a funk wondering \\\"what was that?\\\" Long held notions of the Force and the Jedi are seemingly mocked in an almost forced barrage of failed humor. The film was designed more as a commercial piece to stand on its own as an independent film rather than trying to fit into the storyline of the franchise. What we're left with is a mess that J.J. Abrams will have a uphill battle to overcome in Episode IV.","true":true}
