Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie. Only regret is it not being longer or split into 2. The emotion in the writing and accruing was fantastic. Also liked the not pure black\/white (dark\/light) of the characters in a contrary sort of way that is sometimes seen.","true":true}
