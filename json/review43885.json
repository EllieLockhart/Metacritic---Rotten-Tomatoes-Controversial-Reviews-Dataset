Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Those who are more immersed in the Star Wars story\\, lore\\, and universe will be very disappointed. It is an enjoyable film to watch on a very shallow level\\, which is not a level on which Star Wars is meant to be viewed. I tried VERY hard not to be disappointed\\, as I haven't actively disliked ANY Star Wars film thus far and was incredibly excited for this film\\, as with all of them. It seems there is a strong divide between casual fans and hardcore fans of the franchise\\, with the former having loved it and the latter not liking it. Shallow and inconsequential are the two words I'd use to describe it. Cinematically speaking\\, it's a very well done movie overall. But I believe the strength of Star Wars is its lore\\, depth\\, and storytelling capabilities\\, all of which were not only not capitalized upon\\, but were frankly permanently ruined in my opinion.","true":true}
