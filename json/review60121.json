We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Great sequel of a previous great and loved game\\, but not for everyone. I will start with the gameplay first.The gameplay is the same as in the previous game but with little new things(for example new skill trees or new upgrades for the weapons which can be seen).I really like that they added more exploring to the game because is making much longer and interesting. I appreciate that the weapons are not exactly the same one for the both characters. The listening mode is still weird  but sometimes it can help you a lot. The graphics are one of the best ones I\u2019ve ever seen. The sound is so good\\, it make you know when the battle start and when it ends\\, it can make you feel like you want to hear it more when you hear characters chatting\\, and even the gunshots hear awesome\\, and is also a important part when you try to play stealth because you can hear a weird sound when someone is seeing you.Now about the story: I must say that I almost cried when Joel died and I understand why the did that\\, but the reason I still don\u2019t like his death is how they killed him.It could be more heroic\\, like saving Ellie from a gunshot or something like that.In the beginning I hated Abby (even after the end) but after some time I realised that she\u2019s not a bad person as most of the people thinks. Her appearance is still making me fell weird but after some thinking I understood why she look so muscular(is because she lives in a camp which is like a military base and also she wanted to make sure that she is strong enough to kill Joel no matter what or how). Ellie in my opinion haven\u2019t changed much from the previous game. The only difference from the previous game is that she can swim\\, make her own decisions much cleaver and better(at leat at the end) and other little stuffs. I still don\u2019t understand why some people have problems with LGBT of this game\\, or the \u2018transgender\u2019 girl\\, I mean how can that change the game so much\\, if you want you can always skip the parts where you can see these things. The ending lacks a little but it is OK.I mean it wasn\u2019t necessary to make Ellie lose her fingers.I encourage people to buy this game\\, but at an offer(just if you want).If you don\u2019t have a problem with Joel\u2019s death\\,LGBT\\,transgender\\,Abby arms I believe this will be one of your favourite games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
