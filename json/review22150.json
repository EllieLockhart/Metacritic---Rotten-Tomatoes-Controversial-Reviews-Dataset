Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kind of a turd. Was so bad it systematically made the Force Awakens worse\\, made the 3rd movie virtually limp in hype\\, and secured its own pkace next to the Phantom Menace in most disliked Star Wars movies. A mess of characters and storylines that meander\\, insult older fans\\, and ultimately amount to nothing in the grander Star Wars stort. A snarky dismantling of what you enjoy about Star Wars in the first place. Rian Johnson may be a capable director\\,  but as a writer\\, as a Star Wars curator\\,  he's a smoking disaster.  Keep him far far away from any further Star Wars decisions. This movie was prequel atmosphere 2.0.","true":true}
