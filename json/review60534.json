From environment design and combat style to story and characters development. I can't count how many emotions I felt playing this game. Creators of this game really know how to play with your feelings and make you divide yourself in two parts and make them fight each other.

I can't count how many emotions I felt playing this game. Creators of this game really know how to play with your feelings and make you divide yourself in two parts and make them fight each other. Giving you a really hard time and forcing you do stuff you don't want to. I rated this game 10\/10 because it deserves it. No matter how much grief\\, anxiety and anger it also made us feel. I can't deny the beginning of the game was sort of weird and part of the ending was kind of unnecessary but everything was how it should be. I think that the main message creators wanted to give us is forgiveness. Anyway\\, perfect game. 10\/10. Totally recommended.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
