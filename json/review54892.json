Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems good at first but then if you even think about it for a second\\, it sucks. They have completely changed Luke and don't even mention Han's death as far as I remember. No questions were answered except one and even then it was disappointing. They kill off most of the First Order and Resistance and by the end of the film there is no way the resistance can win at all\\, ever due to them having less than 10 members left. But I'm sure somehow they will. As for the final battle battle its literally Hoth but with salt\\, and the only reason its different is that some guy tastes it and says it salt. The thing with this film is that it embraces the\\, \\\"Bigger is better\\,\\\" and it certainly backfired. Rey is still a Mary Sue. Finn could have had a heroic sacrifice near the end but that asian (can't even remember her name) stops him. Luke dies just looking at the sun right after a time in the story that he could've died\\, nothing would've changed and it would have meant something. You should feel something when a character like that dies. Leia could have had a meaningful death but no\\, instead she flies through space like superman. They should've re-shot everything after that and just delayed the release. Don't even get me started on the obvious political agenda. Summary: Rerun of Empire\\, horrible movie\\, no respect for old characters or the fans\\, obvious political agenda.","true":true}
