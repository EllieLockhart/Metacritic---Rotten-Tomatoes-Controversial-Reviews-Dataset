Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know where to even begin with this movie\\, it gleefully thumbs it's nose and mocks\\, via feminist and SJW claptrap\\, much of what made Star Wars great. Mark Hamill has said that he fundamentally disagreed with almost every decision Rian Johnson made for Luke's character and I've got to say that he's been very restrained in saying that because what's been done to the character of Luke Skywalker in this movie\\, is nothing short of cultural vandalism. Rian Johnson has made JJ Abrams look like Spielberg\\, it absolutely boggles the mind that Disney have given him a whole trilogy. You've got to wonder just what planet these Hollywood types occupy. This most millennial of movies - preachy\\, shallow\\, self satisfied\\, lazy\\, boring and nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is - with a whole act that's completely pointless\\, is chock full of terribly out of place\\, cartoonish humour and laughably bad dialogue. Luke chose the island because it was \\\"the most unfindable\\\"\\, I kid you not\\, he actually says that. He needn't have worried\\, I highly doubt this insulting hack job will be much sought after in the years to come.","true":true}
