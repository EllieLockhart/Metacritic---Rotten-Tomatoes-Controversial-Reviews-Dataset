Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great interesting and amazing visuals with the planets and you can feel a connection with the characters and the fight scenes and you can connect with Kyle ren who is played amazingly this movie gets to much hate and it was a good sequel to number 7","true":true}
