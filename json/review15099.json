Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this moving feeling amped. Wasn't Empire Strikes Back\\, but was parsects away from the Phantom Menace. Then I heard that there was backlash and I couldn't figure out why.  The world has changed since the original trilogy. Star Wars has changed too. Change isn't always bad. Maybe people (or bots) hated the social commentary? I'd recommend those that hated it see it again. Let go of your hate; it's a good movie.","true":true}
