Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such grievous shortcomings in film making should not be lauded and accepted just because it is Star Wars. Poorly written\\, poorly directed. It looks fantastic but that shouldn't be enough. The leaps in logic so broad you could run a star destroyer through them. Such asanine story points that I am baffled that they ever existed past storyboarding\\, let alone the final cut. Disney's handling of what once was a rich and engrossing cinematic and literary universe is so devoid of intelligent thought\\, I would only classify The Last Jedi as straight to red box worthy schlock.
