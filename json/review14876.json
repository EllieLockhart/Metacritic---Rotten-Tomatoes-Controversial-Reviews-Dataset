Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand why this film was subjected to such criticism by audiences\\, it may not have been the no holds barred thrill ride of its predecessor\\, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good film; it is indeed more of a slow burner than episode VII\\, however the build of the plot is well paced\\, and the finale definitely feels earned. Yes there are a couple of scenes that seemed a little out of place upon first viewing\\, but once one has revisited this film\\, one can see exactly why each element was added\\, and the plot is well-constructed. The only major criticism I have is that Snoke's character was criminally underused\\, and discarded rather abruptly given the limited screen time we get with him in the flesh\\, but apart from that it lived up to the hype\\, and is a fitting follow-up to what has been a very strong series of sequels.","true":true}
