Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like the latest iteration of the Star Wars sage\\, The Last Jedi\\, however I did not love it like I should have. Without any spoilers\\, I thought the story was a bit weak with some plot holes. I didn't particular care for the direction that they took some of the characters. Despite this\\, there were aspects of the movie that were enjoyable and while it wasn't a perfect movie\\, I can say I did enjoy it overall.","true":true}
