Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a entertaining movie.... but it's so far far away of the Star Wars universe\\, the villains are pathetic\\, the Luke character was totally destroyed (this is the saddest part). Rian Johnson just left a huge mess to JJ Abrahms.","true":true}
