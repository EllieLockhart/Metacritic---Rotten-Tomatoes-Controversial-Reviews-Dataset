Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is bland\\, emotionless\\, riddled with plot holes and goes on about an hour too long. Worse then that it throws all the potential for Disneys star wars movies out the window and actually makes the previous films worse. Everything achieved in the original trilogy has been thrown out the window and made to be completely pointless. These characters are shells of people with no depth\\, by the end of the film I felt nothing for any of them and no longer cared who won or lost.","true":true}
