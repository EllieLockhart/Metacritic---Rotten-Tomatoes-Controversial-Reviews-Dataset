Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brutal. It's one thing to accidentally make a bad movie but something this chronic could only be made by someone actively trying to make something harmful to the franchise. The Star wars Christmas special was less damaging to Canon. Ewok: Battle for Endor was a better movie. The over arching message is that StarWars is stupid bullshit for nerds and you're stupid for liking it\\, nerd.","true":true}
