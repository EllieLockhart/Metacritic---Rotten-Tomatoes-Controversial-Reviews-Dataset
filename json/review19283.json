Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not perfect\\, but it's entertaining. Unless\\, of course\\, you are a fanboy with preconceived notions of what the movie should be\\, where it should go\\, and what the heroes should look like (skin color and sex); in that case\\, you may want to sit this one out or risk leaving the theater feeling butt hurt.","true":true}
