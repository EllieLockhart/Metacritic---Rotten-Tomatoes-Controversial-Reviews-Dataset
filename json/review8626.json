Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Star Wars movie that actually left me feeling disappointed and bum. Jokes were out of place\\, pacing is off\\, lots of plot holes\\, missed opportunities\\, and plot twist just for the sake of plot twist without any payoff. For a sequel to the Force Awakens\\, this was horrible. Rian Johnson seems to only care about Rey and Kylo story and just decided to mess with everyone else. Finn storyline repeated itself\\, Poe became a hothead\\, & General Leia became Superman. Ugh! Cinematography was great though.  Which is where the half star came from.","true":true}
