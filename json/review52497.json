Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible and cring worthy dialogue and over dramatic  acting from some actors like Oscar Issac and Kelly Marie make this movie UNWATCHABLE\\, and in to the mix plot holes as big as Nicki Minaj's ass\\, it  just gets worse more you think about it.\\nMaking almost every intense scene in to a comedy skit the excessive use of the annoying  porgs witch you cans say are this movie's jarjar just to sell a few plushies and a god awful \\\"twist\\\" that totally ruins Luke's character you are sure to piss of the hardcore fans.\\nAlso the movie is predictable like saying that tomorrow the sun is gonna rise.\\nHopefully episode nine bearable at least\\, zero stars","true":true}
