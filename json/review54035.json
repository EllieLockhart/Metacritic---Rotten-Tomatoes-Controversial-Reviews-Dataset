Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't recall the last time I was so devastated\/disappointed leaving the movie theatre. Star wars has always been very special to me and I am a huge fan of episodes 1 through 6 as well as the clone wars cartoon. \\nThe entire arc of the story through that time span was incredibly cohesive and fairly well thought out. \\nEpisode 8 has a very \\\"false\\\" feeling to it. Nothing makes sense within the grand scheme of the overall story. Snoke should not exist\\, the First Order is a lame rip off of the Empire (which was utterly destroyed). \\nThe film is riddled with plot holes and the worst offense is that the director clearly did not have a thorough understanding of the original trilogy nor the character of Luke SKywalker.\\nThe visuals and sound were spectacular in Episode 8\\, sadly that is the only praise I can throw at it\\, which saddens me deeply.\\nIn conclusion\\, it feels like an enormous missed opportunity at tying in the new with the old and there are likely many qualified individuals out there who could have crafted a much better film than Rian Johnson did.","true":true}
