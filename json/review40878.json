Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie craps all over the original trilogy's themes and characters. Truly disappointing. It's all brainless action and special effects. The story is hollow and nonsensical. Non-fans and the general public will probably enjoy it as a 'popcorn' blockbuster\\, but it's all style and very little substance. I want stuff more like Rogue One\\, less like this haphazard bastardization of characters like Luke and total disregard for the few interesting story elements and questions raised in TFA. Terrible effort by Rian Johnson. I have no idea how JJ Abrams can salvage this story after so many of the groundwork he laid in TFA was uprooted by the careless writing and direction of TLJ. Critics are out of touch and clearly either shilling for Disney or just clueless about the IP. What a shame.","true":true}
