Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPILLER. WARNUNG. Very film. Much like. Also Star War. Power Girl very wise. Much master. Emo boy very bad\\, bad ass even. He so emo everyone annoy. Very flim. Woman flies through space. Bad pilot disobeys many times. So brave no-one notices how stupid he. Luke kills children\\, not very film. He also very old and stupider than God Girl. God girl strong woman\\, very film. Bad villain Snolp not very film\\, he died much anger to Emo boy. Emo boy very dark\\, even darker than blackness. His sword red. Also Hux\\, Pux\\, Plizma\\, Gux and DJ not veryfilm\\, they stupider than Emo boy. Wer Knigits of Ren? Nobody knows. Why ships run out of gasoline but bad ships too? Lots of shiny boom\\, and very political correct. Much like. Also Star War.Five good kill empire of bad\\, that very uplifting. God Girl becomes wiser than Yuda. I give 1 star\\, for only 1 is film.
