Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen this movie twice with my wife. At the end of the second viewing my feelings did not change from that of the first. I believe Rian Johnson and Disney had a momentary lapse of reason. There is very little in this movie that I will remember fondly. As a matter of fact\\, I'm done with this trilogy as it seems SWVII:TFA was a waste of time. I'll take the prequel and original trilogy's any day over this tripe. RIP","true":true}
