Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this is easily in the top 4 Star Wars movie for me! Easily better than The Force Awakens. As a Star Wars fan\\, R. Johnson did a lot of things right to move the franchise forward. Not sure if I liked the Canto Bight excursion\/mission though. Could have been shorter. I thought the Luke Skywalker correct was PERFECTLY written! \\n\\nAnd no\\, I don't work for Disney.","true":true}
