Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to burn down a franchise's mythology why do it in the second movie of the third trilogy? Just burn it down and start fresh and skip TFA. TFA introduced some cool new characters and had some great cliffhangers. TLJ took a dump on them and some people scream \\\"That is what art is supposed to be.\\\"\\n\\nAnd I prefer Jar Jar to Princess Leia space ghost.","true":true}
