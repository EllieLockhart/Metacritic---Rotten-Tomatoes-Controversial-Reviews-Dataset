Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really do not understand why this movie polarized so many people. It includes interesting characters\\, surprising story twists and a great mind-set. It mixes up light and dark\\, good and evil\\, but in the end shows us (Finn) what to stand up for. I think it leaves so much open for the last episode and I hope that this movie will then make us look back in another way. Everything we thought we understood in ep7 got challenged and that is just one of the reasons the length did not bother me at all. The humour is no counter argument to me either\\, as Star Wars has always been a movie addressed to children and whenever the movie turns serious\\, there are no porgs destroying the tension. I really love the movie and the characters and if you have never been interested in Star Wars you still have to admire the acting and big pictures it creates.","true":true}
