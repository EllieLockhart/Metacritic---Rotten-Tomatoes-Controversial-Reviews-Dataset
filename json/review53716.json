Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Genuinely Bad. Space gravity wouldn't arc energy cannon blasts\\, and the energy of said blast wouldn't dissipate over the vacuum of space. This makes the whole premise flawed to begin with. The Finn story is just god awful\\, and managed to make a fancy star wars casino agrivating. Also\\, the film seems to play politics a bit with the personification of corporate greed. Just unnecessary. Also the interaction between the Pink haired Lady\\, Poe and PL was very dumb. \\n\\nSilver lining: coolest lightsaber battle ever. Ray\/kylo are awesome together.","true":true}
