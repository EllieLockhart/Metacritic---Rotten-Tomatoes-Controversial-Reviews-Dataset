Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie doesn\u2019t do much for the Star Wars fan. The Last Jedi is a reminder that as more content is created the more chances we have for a bad movie. And The Last Jedi is just that\\, a poorly told story in the Star Wars universe. I truly believe that one day I\u2019ll appreciate this film in some capacity like I do Lucas\u2019s prequel films. But\\, til then Im going to chalk this up as a loss and hope the next one is a little better.","true":true}
