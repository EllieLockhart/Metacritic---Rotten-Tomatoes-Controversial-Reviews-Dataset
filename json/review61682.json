Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Might have been an at least ok game if it wasn't a Last of Us title.\rThe story sacrifices established and loved characters in the most pathetic ways to introduce new characters that are mediocre at best and absolutely terrible at worst. They also expect you to connect to the Killer of Joel\\, which is something that is set up to fail if you had any love for the first game and got invested in the story. To add to that\\, established characters just act out of order\\, very little apart from the shell remains of them.\rI will give the game this\\, it looks and sounds beautiful\\, has a dense atmosphere and is acted out really well (allthough not as good as the first part though)\\, which is pretty much the only reason I played through it.\rAnother big problem is how the story is told\\, it's basically Inception with Flashbacks into Flashbacks into Flashbacks which gets pretty ridiculous fast. Also the fact that they introduced the Abby gameplay part AFTER she killed Joel is absolutely mimd bending\\, personally I just couldn't connect after the fact that she brutally butchered one of my favorite characters ever to be created in all of media\\, like he was a cheap NPC.\rApart from that Part 2 is a massive letdown to the core fanbase of Part 1\\, while it may please newcomers\\, passerbys and obviously mainstream media\\, for some arbatrary reasons.\rHonestly I never felt the need to hate on a game on social media\\, but this was the breaking point for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
