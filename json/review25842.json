Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not even close to the best SW movie.  Average at best.  Plot holes\\, bad character decisions and stupid character arcs.\\nI wonder how much Disney paid the critics to give it such a high rating.","true":true}
