Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it  lifetime star wars fan and I'm not stopping now. I think people really need to open their minds to new plots and characters. Yes it is an extremely different feel to the whole star wars franchise and maybe I'm not crazy about it being involved with Disney now but I really believe that Rian Johnson did an unbelievable job with all the characters. He gets so deep and emotional with them that makes them feel very relatable. I really could have gone with a different side story in leiu of the Canto Bight scene but I suppose it does build Rose and Finn's relationship. Overall I LOVED IT and I'm so sad I will have to wait till 2019\\, guess it'll just be novel\\, blu-ray release and fellow fans YouTube videos to hold me over. Biggest take away\\, haters gonna hate but I ain't listening.","true":true}
