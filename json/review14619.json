Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been quite a big Star Wars fan for a while now. I feel that the last jedi did not kill anyone's childhood but instead introduced a new era of Star Wars The Force Awakens had been leading up to. Yes it had a some flaws but Star Wars fans old and new should not criticize it for being different but enjoy watching Star Wars grow and change.","true":true}
