Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so mind numbingly boring. Rey has no character growth or arc in this film. She is just meandering through the plot. They made Luke skywalker look like a fool the entire movie. Rose tico as a character was an unnecessary addition. Fin has no character arc or growth. It's a meaningless sequel","true":true}
