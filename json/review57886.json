Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We wait 40 years for this. J.J. Abrams knocks 9 pins down with TFA and asks Rian Johnson to pick up the spare...instead of picking up the spare\\, Rian thought it would be fun to take J.J. Abram's ball and bowl a gutter ball down a DIFFERENT LANE. Rian says \\\"I'll just start a new game down at this lane\\\" and walks off as J.J. Abrams now has to finish off his tainted match. It was a spectacle seeing Rian do it\\, it was still a douche-move. \\n\\nIt's been 2 films already\\, and Rey still has yet to be defeated. Without defeat or failure\\, a protagonist shows no real growth. So much opportunity lost. They killed off all the REAL\/POWERFUL villains\\, now we're stuck watching a cranky Ben Solo shake his rattle. The only redeeming factor to this trilogy would be if J.J. brought in The Knights of Ren he introduced in TFA and actually allow Star Wars villains to BE villains for once. Star Wars has become the new Transformers. bottom line: all spectacle and no story - no genuine reason to care while watching it. The lore is dead (temporarily (hopefully))","true":true}
