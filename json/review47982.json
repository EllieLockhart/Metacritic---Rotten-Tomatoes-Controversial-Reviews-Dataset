Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I understand the issues some long time fans have with the character evolution of Luke in the film\\, it is overall an incredible movie in the Star Wars Saga and delivers action\\, sequence & drama for the growing mythos. But a major lacking part would have to be the use of Captain Phasma\\, who could have used more love in this film\\, and given more to return with in the sequel.","true":true}
