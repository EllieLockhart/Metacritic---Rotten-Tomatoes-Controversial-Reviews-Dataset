Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was terrible\\, not only as a Star Wars movie but as any movie. All of the critics are correct. Misplaced humor that diminished the plot and characters for a cheap laugh. Horrible writing. This is the middle act of a three act play that took the first act and threw it in the garbage while it removed any anticipation for the third act. Something is also strange with these reviews.. most are negative yet it still has a 49% audience score. \\nMost of the initial box office for this movie was because of the Star Wars name and the anticipation of seeing what happens next after the Force Awakens. I don't think many will rewatch this and history will not be kind to this installment.","true":true}
