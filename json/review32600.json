Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a great movie!  I really enjoyed it!  I thought Rian Johnson's directing was good\\, and the story was captivating.  All of the performances by the actors were excellent.  As a long-time Star Wars fan I highly recommend it.  I give it a 4.5 out of 5 star rating.","true":true}
