All the review bombs for this game tells the tale. This game was reviewed perfectly from the majority of critics\/youtubers alike. If you want a good \u201cfan\u201d review look at the fans rating it between a 10-7. For me I give it a ten because it is truly an amazing game. Graphically it is stunning there is no denying that. So for people to give it a 0-4 without evenI\u2019m going to put it like this. All the review bombs for this game tells the tale.

For me I give it a ten because it is truly an amazing game. Graphically it is stunning there is no denying that. So for people to give it a 0-4 without even thinking about the graphics in mind are idiots. The sound and level design is phenomenally done. Again people giving it a 0-4 without that in mind are dumb. The combat and gameplay are superb. If you gave it a 0-4 for that again you are not all up there and have a lot of screws loose. The controls and overall feel of controlling the character is amazing. The accessibility they put into this game truly is amazing and is going to be a standard for games to come. The story is a emotional rollercoaster just like the first game. Everything about this game is amazing. Stop listening and believing the haters who thought about giving this game a 0 the day it was available to. Because of what some leaks that were half right months prior? A lot of those leaks you read aren\u2019t true. If you aren\u2019t a bigot than you will enjoy this game. It is truly a masterpiece in my humble opinion. Would I have liked the story to go a different route sure I guess a tad bit. Since that\u2019s the biggest complaint\/hate of this game is the story. Yes it sucks something terrible happens and I wish it didn\u2019t but it\u2019s ok because unlike angry **** in their parents basements I\u2019m at peace with it ladies and gents. We can wish and want the story to do this or go this way but at the end of the day guess what? We\u2019re not the ones writing or making the story. It\u2019s not our story to tel. We are the players. We\u2019re here for the ride. And if you didn\u2019t like the story of this game that\u2019s fine and all\\, If you actually played The game. But you can not deny the marvel of everything else that I mentioned. The music in this game is amazing. So many intense moments. So many twists and turns and unexpected stuff happens in this game. That the leaks paint a different picture than what the game is. An it\u2019s sad because a lot of dumb humans believe it. For me this game is GOTY contender and my advice to anyone reading this is to buy this game. If you love Naughty Dog and trust them and see that they have brought us nothing but great fun and amazing games. Than you won\u2019t be disappointed in this game. I loved it! To all the haters eat a dick. To the Xbox fanboys hating; and probably are more than half the ones review bombing eat a dick. You\u2019re console\/consoles will never get a game like The Last Of Us. So enjoy you\u2019re overplayed Halo and Gears. Enjoy the review bombing; and **** talk all you want **** because 10-15 years from now Y\u2019all won\u2019t have a console to play on. Xbox won\u2019t exist just like Gamestop. The only thing that will exist is Gamepass but that\u2019ll be available on everything including Playstation. Peace out and everyone who is enjoying this game as much as me stand firm and say **** the haters. Game Of The Year.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
