{"101487":129091,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely HATED this one... and that is coming from a SW fan that is so die hard that I have seen every other SW movie at LEAST 5 times IN THEATERS. I saw this one only twice... and the second time only because I thought there was no way that it could be as bad as it seemed to be.\\n\\nOne huge issue was that there were SO many logical problems and flaws with the plot that I just could no longer suspend my disbelief... and that is saying something since I think we can all agree that the original trilogy had its fair share of plot holes. I will briefly touch on what were the ones that I remember from a month ago.\\n\\n- Gravity dropped bombs on a space bomber \\n- arcing (nonprojectile) shots in space\\n- ships that slowed down and tilted when they ran out of fuel (seriously... its space guys)\\n- even though there were no force fields (no blue shimmer) the space bomber still had atmosphere and gravity (ship too small to have a grav generator) when the bay doors were open\\n- Lightspeed apparently takes zero time now\\n- Lightspeed can be used to make one ship a super weapon\\, but was never used prior to the very end\\n- Rose saying she spends all day behind pipes\\, and Finn confirmed from 7 as a terrible pilot\\, and yet they can both pilot quite well in the speeder scene\\n- somehow they have Mazs personal number\\n- Poe made literally every wrong decision\\, even started a mutiny\\, and was personally responsible for almost every death in the resistance\\, and yet he keeps getting forgiven\\n- Vice Admiral Holdo stayed on the ship because \\\"someone had to pilot it\\\"\\, when there is autopilot\\, AND she was just standing at the window looking out\\, not even piloting and watched while the first 6 or 7 escape ships got shot down.\\n- Poe called off the assault on the death star rammer when LITERALLY their only plan at that point was to hold out for reinforcements and the cannon could definitely break through the blast door.\\n- Rose and Finn somehow made it back when Rose was passed out and they were stranded in crashed speeders very far from their base and right under the noses of the first order\\n- Rey apparently is good at EVERYTHING with zero training. (makes her a boring character)\\n- Killing off Snoke removed the only imposing antagonist. Kylo has been beaten at every turn so far so he is not threatening. This leads to a much weaker buildup for the final movie. IMO it would have been much more interesting if Rey had given into the dark side and joined Kylo\\, and then Leia and Luke would have to stop them in 9... but Disney doesnt have the balls to make a good girl the bad guy.\\n- Apparently releasing captive animals makes it \\\"all worth it\\\" even though they believe that the fate of the galaxy is in their hands\\, and the animals can easily be recaptured and the damage they did will likely be fixed without too much fuss.\\n- Luke apparently has backslid on character development. All the mistakes he made were lessons he learned in the original trilogy.\\n- AFTER LOSING ALMOST THEIR ENTIRE FORCE\\, AND HAVING BEEN DEALT DEFEAT AFTER DEFEAT\\, ONE OF THE END SCENES IS THE REMAINING FEW RESISTANCE MEMBERS FLYING AWAY IN THE FALCON AND THEY ARE ALL LAUGHING AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER. yea right... that is so unrealistic that it is jarring to watch.\\n\\nOn top of these\\, I cannot for the life of me fathom how some are hailing this movie as so innovative and fresh... ALMOST EVERY SCENE WAS STOLE DIRECTLY FROM EPISODES 5 OR 6.\\n\\n-Emperor palpatine and vader try to turn luke and taunt him showing him the destruction of the rebels\\n-battle of hoth involving speeders against walkers assaulting a base\\n- the Falcon being chased by TIEs and flying around all the beams and jutting pieces of the Death Star II\\n- A search for an old friend\/ally who then turns on them (and looks pretty roguish)\\nthese sound familiar?? They should because they have direct reskins in the new movie. I was hoping they would do something cool and new with this movie... but they followed in the footsteps of 7 by showing us that they dont care about giving us a good story\\, all they want is to use nostalgia to try and win over the diehard fans like me while using virtue signalling feminist propaganda to try and win over the media and the crazies.\\n\\nScrew you Disney. You are turning a beloved franchise into an abomination. Just look at china. They dont have the worship of SW like we do\\, so they see it from a more neutral perspective... and it took them all of a weekend to declare it \\\"Baizuo\\\" (Chinese term for crazy SJW) and remove it from theaters... I may not agree with everything China does\\, but I have to agree here. This movie was a virtue signalling SJW dumpster fire\\, and I hate to say it but I will not be seeing the next star wars movie unless I hear from a lot of people that it is actually good.","true":true}
