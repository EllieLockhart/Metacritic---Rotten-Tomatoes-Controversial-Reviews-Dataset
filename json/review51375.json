Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute terrible movie!!!! Can't believe how bad this story is written. Putting all those political issues like \\\"this movie needs more female for no reason\\, and animal crualty\\, before a good written story is unbelievable!!!! Ans still get very mad about what they heve done to Luke Skywalker!! This movie could have been epic. Clearly anyone who likes this movie sees this as a standalone movie\\, cause when you see it in the Star Wars Saga\\, you cannot possibly say they did a great job with this movie....","true":true}
