On top of that there is a constant social and political agenda being blatantly thrown in your face throughout the game which really detracts from the main story(which isn\u2019t that good anyways). Overall I thought they made a great game from a graphical and gameplay perspective but I found myself just trudging through the story at some points and at others just wanting to roll my eyes thinking \u201coh boy more social agenda being thrown at me\u201d. Overall I have had to force myself to try and like the game at certain times due to the poor story and the constant social narrative taking away from the game instead of adding to it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
