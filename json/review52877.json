Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ambivalence or even worse\\, hostility toward the mythos along with the faithful fan base and a total embracing of moral relativism makes for a movie with no heroes\\, no character development\\, and little humanity. Beloved core characters are put out to pasture after learning nothing from their experiences in previous installments. I did not think it was possible to quell the love for a franchise with such a divisive stroke\\, but those heading this film have force choked the identity of this beloved franchise and alienated its fanbase with such profundity\\, star wars as a cultural stalwart may never recover. In itself it may not be a poor movie\\, but in the series it somehow manages to bring destruction to the essence of star wars magic. A mythos cannot have the same power in every generation and yet star wars magic has spanned many.

He means to burn it down. And to large degree\\, he has.","true":true}
