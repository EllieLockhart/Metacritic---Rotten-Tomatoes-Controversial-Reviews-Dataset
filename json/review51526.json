Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete mess of a story with massive plot holes and silly dialogue. Outstanding special effects and above average acting. But if you don't have a decent story that makes sense\\, whats the point. No No No.","true":true}
