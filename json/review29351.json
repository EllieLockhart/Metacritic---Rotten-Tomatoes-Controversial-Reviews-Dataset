Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson clearly cared about the character of Kylo Ren based off the way the majority of this movie operates to serve him and his arc. Unfortunately\\, there are other characters in this film who vary between being relatively well used (Rey) to their character being rewritten to raise sympathy for Kylo Ren (Luke) to being an afterthought given directionless\\, contrived plots (Finn\\, Rose\\, Poe). I don't care what lazy attempt at being woke you have\\, white women slapping and throwing around a latino man is not a good look\\, nor turning Finn from a lead character to one confined to an ultimately pointless subplot where he fails at everything and accomplishes nothing. Also the pacing and editing is shit\\, it goes for half an hour longer than necessary.","true":true}
