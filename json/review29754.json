Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian managed to superbly direct the biggest mess of stupidity I have ever seen. As a movie on its own it makes no sense\\, the side quests were pointless\\, the story was slow and uninteresting and the characters were annoying. As a Star Wars movie he managed to take a huge steaming dump on fans the moment we first saw Luke all for the sake of a cheap laugh. Everything that was set up in The Force Awakens was undone in this movie for the sake of 'shock value' that when thought about later just makes you angry rather than impressed. I'm all for taking Star Wars in a new direction but this was just lazy story telling. Help us JJ Abram's\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
