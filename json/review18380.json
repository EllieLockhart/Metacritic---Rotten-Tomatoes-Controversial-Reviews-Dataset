Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a beautifully shot movie.  It has very impressive special effects.  It  is the middle part of a trilogy.  It has a poorly written protagonist and story.  The protagonists main problem is that she is written in a way that is too perfect which leads to boredom.  There was one interesting villain from the first one that was quickly dispatched with ease by his student who could not beat an untrained protagonist.  The backstory of Snoke was key in this one to explain where he came from since this is a continuity from the original saga.  Kylo Ren as the main villain leads much to be desired.  He is not frightening in the slightest.  There are many poorly written characters in this movie.  Rose is an unnecessary character.  Phasma was a semi interesting character but was poorly utilized.  Holdo is the worst new character in the franchise\\, when she died I was actually glad.  The underlying tones of third wave feminism ruined this movie and essentially killed this whole franchise.  I will not be buying any more star wars merchandise until Kathleen Kennedy is removed and left leaning politics is removed from movies.","true":true}
