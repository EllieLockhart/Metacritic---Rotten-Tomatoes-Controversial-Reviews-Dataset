Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What are the critics smoking?  The problems with this movie are so numerous that I don't have time to list them all.  Fans of this movie will say\\, \\\"it's a bold new direction.\\\"  I will say it's a blunder that not only dooms itself\\, but ruins the direction of the third installment.  ... oh\\, by the way\\, BB8 pilots an AT-ST ... this is your Star Wars critics!  Look at it!  Look at it!","true":true}
