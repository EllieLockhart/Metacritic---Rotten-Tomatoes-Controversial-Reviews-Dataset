Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WEll so much force here and no lightsaber fights.This LEa scene in the space .. no words for this.The Force Awakens was better i hope J.J. Abrams will fix this movie in the next part. Again this stupid jokes ...disney put the in every movie \\, its dumb and boring.But still i enjoy the movie","true":true}
