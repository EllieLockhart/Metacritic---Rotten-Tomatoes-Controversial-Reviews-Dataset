Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect film.  The Canto Bight scenes were an unneeded diversion\\, and served little other then to give Finn something to do.  They also called back the Prequels in tone\\, feel\\, and score.  But\\, luckily\\, they don't stay there long.  The rest film was a great deconstruction and reconstruction moving forward.","true":true}
