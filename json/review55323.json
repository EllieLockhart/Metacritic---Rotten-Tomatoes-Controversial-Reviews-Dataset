Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Likes:\\n-Soundtracks are always great!\\n-Pacing is alright.\\n-Cinematography is decent and camera angles are not distracting.\\n-Explored the SW universe more (creatures\\, planets\\, societies...)\\n-Character development is okay\\, right?\\n-Unconventional SW formula but not really\\, I guess...\\n-Makes the pre-sequel bootlickers nauseated because we don't have Mark being all the traditional heroic figure\\n\\nDislikes:\\n-Use of wide lenses and stretched the characters like never before. Adam and Daisy look super wide onscreen.\\n-Almighty and powerful Snoke took a cheap death.\\n-A bit lengthy just to tell a story of what came before and what's going to come next.\\n-Classic SW elements never changed.\\n-Different from Empire Strikes Back? Somehow I felt it's quite formulaic too.\\n-Myself being bored of the same old story liao...New saga would help with this personal problem\\n\\nRant:\\n-Super Leia anyone?\\n-They cannot bear having Luke teach Rey all the three lessons eh?\\n-How they found DJ. haha\\, such a coincidence eh\\n-Holdo and DJ are okay but yeah...\\n-Had to kiss before passing out? Dang cringy it is...\\n-Certain CG shots paused for too long and look weird","true":true}
