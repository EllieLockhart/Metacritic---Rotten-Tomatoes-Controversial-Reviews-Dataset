Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most PROTECTED movie of all time: Protected by paid critics\\, protected by Rotten Tomatoes (which has evidently frozen the audience score at 49%) and even protected from the Razzies! \\nWell Disney\\, try protecting 'Solo' and 'Episode IX' from the mass boycott thats coming!","true":true}
