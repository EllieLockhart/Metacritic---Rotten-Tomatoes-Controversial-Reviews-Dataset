Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TFA and TLJ looks good with their special practical effects and bears the name Star Wars\\, but that\u00b4s it. This it not Star Wars. The new directors does not seem to get the core understanding and lore of the SW universe. To bad most seem to ignore this. Lucasarts already had a finished story for the era after episode 6\\, and the fans seems to ignore that as well. I\u00b4m so disappointed at those people in the community.","true":true}
