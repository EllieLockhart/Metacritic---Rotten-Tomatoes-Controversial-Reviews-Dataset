Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke's character is a caricature of what he was\\, dozens of plotholes and things done for no reason other than the writer thinking it makes sense when the characters couldn't have and awkward \\\"funny\\\" moments mixed in right before or after tragedies.","true":true}
