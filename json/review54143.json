Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like Disney just tried to crank this movie out w\/o any love or attention. SPOILERS- Why would luke preserve himself just to go die in a peaceful manner. Why would leia preform a force move that NO ONE has ever done in the movies. They set up the best death for her.. and then flushed it down the toilet. Also.... When Luke said \\\"it's time for the Jedi to end.\\\" That's complete Disney BS\\, Jedi are the most hopeful characters in the starwars universe\\, they never give up. \\nWould rather watch the pre-quals than this. Worst starwars movie I've ever seen.","true":true}
