Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A huge let down for fans. Clunky story and pacing. Bad jokes that didn't land throughout. Plot holes and many unnecessary twists that were pushed too hard but made no sense. Luke Skywalker was not anything like George Lucas' Skywalker. And everything Abrams had built to in the previous episode was abolished in this one. Also Finn and Roses' side adventure was completely unnecessary. And why didn't Holdo just tell Poe her plan? Even after facing mutany and blasters? Just for another stupid forced twist. Also why the huge chase scene when the first order had it in their power to destroy the resistance ship by other means? Also why did Finn and Rose not get shot at when they were smooching in the battlefield? Also why have a battle but not show us a battle?","true":true}
