Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely hated this film. From the blatant plot holes\\, right down to the SJW politics that it crams down throat\\, it truly is awful.\\n\\nFirstly\\, imagine that this isn't a Star Wars film and think of it as just a regular film. The pacing is terrible\\, the plot holes are unbearable\\, the story telling is lazy\\, the heavy political bias is ridiculous and the dialogue at times is terrible\\, filled with out of place jokes that instantly kill any actual emotion that this film might have had.\\n\\nThe only thing this film has going for it\\, is that it's the best looking Star Wars film we have ever seen with some truly amazing visuals. And if you're the type of person that gets distracted by someone jingling a set of keys whilst saying \\\"look at the shiney shiney\\\". Then this film is for you.\\n\\nIf like me you thought thinks film was garbage\\, then please please please. Don't go to see the Solo film!!!","true":true}
