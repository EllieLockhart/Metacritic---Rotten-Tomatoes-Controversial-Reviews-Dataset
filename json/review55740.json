Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outstanding cinematography\\, glorious acting and an very intriguing and compeling plot. The Last Jedi brings Star Wars to new territory\\, delivering surprises and twists at every turn\\, while giving heartbreaking and funny moments in spades. Warning: go with a open mind. The movie won't follow established formulas. Surprises are in every turn\\, and Star Wars gets only better for it. All the characters gets development\\, and in some cases\\, conclusion.  Speaking of that\\, the ending leaves the final movie in a really open state. We can only dream now to where the franchise will go for there. But we know that it will be great\\, because right now\\, it is.","true":true}
