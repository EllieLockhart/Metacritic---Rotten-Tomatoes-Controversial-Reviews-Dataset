The character development we had I with the first part would never have this outcome. Joel would never make a mistake like this. He was a badass\\, at least give him a noble death. The central of the game was the relationship between Joel and Ellie and right at the beginning\\, Joel is gone. It's not about the fact that he died. IT'S HOW HE DIED! And let's not forget that the trailer has nothing to do with the actual game scenes! A total ripoff. Naughty Dog is over for me\u2026 Expand","true":true}
