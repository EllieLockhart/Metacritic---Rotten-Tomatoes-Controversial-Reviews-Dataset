Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler:  Can someone tell me how Rey got on the Millennium Falcon after leaving Snoke's chamber?  And way to destroy the franchise Rian.  And Luke is going to stand over his nephew and kill him?  I am going to burn this from my mind.  Original Trilogy should have stopped there sadly.  Die Hard\\, will never see a Star Wars film again.","true":true}
