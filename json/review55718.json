Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"one of the worst starwars movie's. the direction there going is mostly fine\\, but Luke's character is destroyed. the slowest chase scene could have been replaced with the empire systematically killing rebel bases using tracking tech. and could have included Phasma destroying such bases. Snokes death could have been overlooked with some kind of back story. anything would have been better then nothing. all the males are portrayed as either evil\\, dumb\\, or alienated. while all the female roles are prestigious and powerful. thanks Kathy Kennedy for that. why did you destroy Luke? all the positive reviews from critics are from fear of loosing there press packages.","true":true}
