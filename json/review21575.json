Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams  handed Rian Johnson the keys to a billion dollar movie and Johnson drove it off a cliff. In a plot line that rivaled Space Balls (spoiler alert) \\n\\nThe Empire chases the rebels waiting for their ship to run out of gas. This was my least favorite SW movie. Disney needs to remove Johnson from having any future part in SW movies. So disappointed - I'll watch it again to see if it was just a bad night but I felt let down.","true":true}
