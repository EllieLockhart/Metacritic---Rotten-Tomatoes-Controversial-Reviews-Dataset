Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good.  If you like plot holes and poor character development\\, you'll love this movie.  What movie were the critics watching?  The director was focused on killing the past and forgot how to tell a good story.  Such potential wasted.","true":true}
