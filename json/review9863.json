Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the Star Wats saga. Couple of situations were goofy. The Irony is that Princess Leia through the force survived space by fly back to safety and sadly didn\u2019t survive flying over the Atlantic.","true":true}
