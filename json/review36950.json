Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was just okay.  Even my 12 year old wasn't impressed.  I was a die hard Star Wars fan.  I own all the movies and have read nearly all the books.  I thought the movie was a little hokey.  The fight scenes were lacking.   The posturing red nights were ridiculous and since when can a padawan jedi move an entire avalanche of stone boulders with ease.  I feel like disney is more concerned with pushing diversity and empowering women than it is in continuing the authentic Star Wars Legacy.  I wish they would have created their own story to push their agenda instead of hijacking Star Wars.","true":true}
