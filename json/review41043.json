Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie flushed Star Wars down the toilet... I could not be more crushed...\\n\\nTook all the characters in ridiculous or wasted directions...\\n\\nMark Hamill is absolutely correct disagreeing with the script... All potentially cool storylines set up in TFA were discarded...\\n\\nSpace flying Leia - 'nuff said...\\n\\nNo Lightsaber on Lightsaber fight?!?!?! WTF...\\n\\nSlow speed car chase in space...\\n\\nAnd on and on - too much bad to list here...\\n\\nDisney has killed Star Wars ever since they bought it - not a single correct decision yet... No interest in seeing any more Disney Star Wars movies...","true":true}
