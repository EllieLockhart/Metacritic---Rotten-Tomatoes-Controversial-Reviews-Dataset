Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Head up ****Spoilers****\\n\\nI admit I want to see it again to be sure this is how I feel\\, but I was thoroughly underwhelmed by this one.  Especially after it was lauded as the best since Empire (which probably didn't help).  Honestly I put it below Revenge of the Sith.\\n\\nThere were some redeeming qualities.  Most of the stuff with Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke was pretty good.  The lightsaber battle in Snoke's throne room being a standout.\\n\\nOther than that however\\, the movie was kind of boring.  The story line that seemed to occupy the most time was a slow boring chase with the woefully underused Finn going off with the uninteresting and irritating Rose on a pointless side quest.  Rose is honestly the biggest lowlight for me in this one especially considering all the hype surrounding her going into the film.\\n\\nThe climactic battle was ripped off from Empire and ended anticlimactically.  None of the characters involved seemed to get their big moment\\, which is a staple of the Star Wars mythos.\\n\\nAll that being said\\, the stage is set for the third act and the interest in what happens next is still there and JJ Abrams is more than capable in bringing the story home.  Who knows\\, maybe what's accomplished in Episode 9 will redeem what happened in episode 8.","true":true}
