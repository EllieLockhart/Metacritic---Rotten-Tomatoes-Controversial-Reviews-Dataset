{"101487":175294,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a tale all about Rian Johnson's ego. The warning signs were there when Mark Hamill let slip that he and Johnson had had some 'creative differences' over Luke's development. Knowing how invested Mark is in the character of Luke\\, his public comments should have been taken more seriously.\\nWhy are so many reviewers so angry about The Last Jedi? Why so many rock-bottom reviews? My take is that Rian Johnson could have had done almost anything he wanted to with the new characters\\, but the existing ones (especially Luke) had to be treated with much greater care and sensitivity. What he did with them wouldn't just affect this movie or this trilogy but the entire Star Wars universe. And he didn't treat them with sensitivity at all. Rian Johnson's 'vision' was more important than all the years of time\\, money\\, and love that millions of people had invested in Luke. After all\\, he was warned\\, but he did it anyway. \\n\\nThe wrong tone is set from the outset. The injection of Marvel-style humour\\, of the one-liner and quip variety\\, feels out of place but is a relentless feature of the movie. The First Order are re-imagined as a comedy caper outfit. Quite how they've managed to reconquer the galaxy\\, in spite of their incompetent officer class\\, is anyone's guess. Hux could have been played by Stan Laurel and is only here to provide comic relief. \\n\\nThe first point at which I considered walking out was when Leia somehow avoided suffocating in space and 'flew' her frozen body back towards her ship - which stayed within constant range of her despite the fact it was moving at full speed (without its hyper-drive engaged). I buried my head in my hands as I heard laughter break out around me. I decided to persevere. I had to see what Luke's fate would be. But that pattern was repeated throughout the movie. Having wondered to myself if I was being too cynical\\, I soon noticed that many other people were adopting the same mannerisms as me; groaning at some of the forced humour\\, facepalming or laughing at parts that were supposed to be serious. That's why I find some of the gushing reviews so difficult to take seriously...\\n\\nAside from the offensive treatment of Luke\\, the main problem the movie (and the trilogy going forward) has is that it doesn't develop the 'new' characters in a way that makes me warm to them. I don't care about Rey. I don't hate her\\, but I don't feel any significant empathy for her. I'm not invested in her story. I still don't even know what her story is\\, to be honest She's the daughter of nobodies who happens to be force sensitive\\, so why should I? Daisy Ridley's wooden acting doesn't help\\, of course. Somewhat oddly\\, she actually performs well in some scenes (particularly those with Adam Driver) but\\, in others\\, her performance is on par with that in TFA and it affects the sense of continuity in the film. I found the contrast jarring at times.\\n\\nI don't particularly care what happens to Finn either\\, although that's nothing to do with John Boyega's performance\\, which is fine enough. I have no idea why Rose is in this movie\\, or why her and Finn's arc takes place at all. It's entirely unnecessary and the whole thing feels\\, again\\, utterly alien to the Star Wars universe. I felt like I was watching a Disney\/Pixar animated feature at certain points - all that was missing was a musical number. \\nThe CGI animals are unimpressive. These scenes will age badly. The animal rights theme was just bizarre. I don't even have the words to describe how weird it felt having that in the movie. Surely there was a better way to introduce Benicio del Toro (who was good\\, for what he did)?\\n I've no doubt the entire casino act will be removed in any fan-edits in the future.\\n\\nCaptain Phasma? Why hire Gwendoline Christie for a bit-part role? We saw her for 2 minutes and she was dead...\\n\\nLaura Dern is beyond awful. There's nothing good I can say either about her character or her performance (or the story-line she's involved in).\\n\\nPoe is the one (new) rebel character I've warmed to\\, probably more due to another great performance from Oscar Isaac than to the abject writing. He\\, Hamill\\, and Driver\\, are this movie's only redeeming features.\\n\\nMark Hamill is terrific\\, considering what he was given to work with. He's by far and away the best thing about the movie. But his arc was an exercise in demoralisation. And his demise was utterly deflating. It was by far and away the most disappointing thing about the movie. In short\\, Luke Skywalker's entire life and career since the Battle of Endor has been a catalogue of self-pity and failure. The Rebel Alliance is weaker than it was on the day he set out from Tatooine with Ben Kenobi. He may as well have stayed at home. His death was essentially meaningless. The rationale for it (to buy time for a handful of Rebels to run through a cave) was weak\\, and it just felt insulting. That the Rebels are rescued on the other side by more Mary Sue antics from Rey just rubs salt in the wounds.\\n\\nAdam Driver is also very good\\, but Kylo Ren is not intimidating enough to take on the role of arch-nemesis in this trilogy. So the killing-off of Snoke is a hard one to fathom. What a waste! Where can it possibly go from here?\\nTo be honest\\, I don't really care. I don't care what happens to any of these characters. They haven't been developed well enough. And too much has been torn up in the name of \\\"being bold and taking risks.\\\" \\n\\nPerhaps there are some people who've taken delight in writing a negative review of this film. I'm not one of them. I feel deflated. It feels like breaking up with an ex\\, in all honesty. I really wanted to love this movie. I've waited 30 years for it. But it's awful. Not just\\, \\\"not good\\\"\\, but awful. It not only fails to inspire\\, but it undermines everything that was formerly inspiring - a film-making disaster that no amount of nice cinematography or epic scoring can make up for. \\n\\nRian Johnson is about to become known as the man who killed Star Wars and you can put money on Disney reversing their decision to hand him a new trilogy. Who in God's name saw what he did here and made him an offer on that basis? The best advice I can give Disney is to fire that person\\, immediately. The next best thing they can do is write this trilogy off and have someone wake up and discover it was all a terrible dream. As nonsensical as that sounds\\, it would be less damaging to their franchise than this was.","true":true}
