Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost perfect. Johnson really put his stamp on Star Wars with a tightly woven narrative and unexpected turns. It feels good to be surprised by Star Wars again. There are only three flaws with this story: Canto Bight drags\\, the scene with Leia flying through space like Marry Poppins is truly awkward\\, and Rose destroying Finn's sacrifice. One more run at the script to fix these moments and this film would be on par with Empire.","true":true}
