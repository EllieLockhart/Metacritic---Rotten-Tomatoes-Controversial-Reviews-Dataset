Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do yourself a favor\\, and go watch this movie\\, ignore the bad reviews and give it a try. Watch it twice and take a moment to see it beyond the action. IMHO\\, This movie was great\\, exploring the \\\"gray\\\" side of the force is something I been looking foward to since KOTOR. Also going back to a more mystical aspect of the force vs the midichlorians crap was a welcoming change.","true":true}
