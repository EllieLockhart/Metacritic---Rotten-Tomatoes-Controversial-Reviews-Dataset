{"101487":133782,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never bother to write a review until I saw this movie. Now\\, I have signed up to Rotten Tomatoes because I want to express my disappointment with Disney's Star Wars. I went to see the movie after all that backslash and I must say that the anger from die-hard fans is justified. This movie is as bad as they pointed.\\n\\nThe revolt wasn't because the fans were \\\"expecting something specific and didn't get it\\\". On the contrary\\, I went so see the movie expecting to be positively surprised and it turned out to be very disappointing. This movie is choppy and incoherent\\, with many plot holes and all the director's choices seemed to be so wrong that insulted the die-hard fans ... and these are things you never expect when you pay to watch a highly anticipated installment of a story you love. It is even worst considering the great number of theories\\, and attention\\, it generated around. \\n\\nIn fact\\, many fan theories are way better than the actual story. In this century\\, the vast number of tools available\\, from fanfics apps to internet forums\\, facilitated to put together an enormous brainpower from all corners of the 'galaxy'. This powerful creativity network brings a new challenge to the studios: it's going to be more and more difficult to satisfy the fans. After seen the movie\\, I was trying to figure why Disney paid so much money for a director alone to come up with whatever he wanted to happen and ruining both the plot and start wars legacy. Many anonymous die-hard fans would have written a better story for no money at all. Plot development\\,  character arcs\\, and everything else are not even close to the creativity of the Star Wars community in the internet.\\n\\nAs a result\\, the apparent inconsistencies between the two movies are too big to be ignored. Rey is a nobody's daughter?? What's that scene where we (supposedly) see Rey's parents leaving Jakku on a spaceship?? And\\, where are the Kylo's Knights?? The assumption at the time was they supported Kylo's betrayal of Luke and the destruction of the Jedi Temple.  Also\\, what to say about Snoke? Fans were (mis)led to believe that he had a strong background\\, be he ended up been foolish and cough off guard. Fans theories had it a lot better than that. Disney\\, face it: you are losing to fans creativity. You'd better explain those (and many others) points better  in the next movie.\\n\\nIf it were not enough a below average story line\\, this movie also slapped in the face of the die-hard fans. What annoyed me most was the complete denial of Luke's legacy. That was not the original Luke tossing of his old family lightsaber\\, that was the \\\"Disney's Luke\\\". If the intention was to make a joke\\, too bad it was not funny... if fact\\, it was offensive. And\\, when Luke and Yoda decide to destroy the Jedi library\\, with the reasoning that Rey\\, a snot-nosed 14-year old girl\\, is wiser than the collected works of all Jedi throughout history... was that really necessary?? Oh\\, yes\\, \\\"let the past die\\\"... c'mon Disney\\, Luke deserves better that hipster nihilism.\\n\\nOn top all those flaws\\, the insistence on lecturing the audience about Disney's SJW agenda actively impedes the plot in several ways. For example\\, Poe's role is totally ruined by an apparent (and unnecessary) deconstruction of the traditional male sci-fi hero. Also\\, Fin and Rose mission to Canto Bight is totally useless\\, but they have to go to the resort planet to literally start murdering people for the crime of being rich. Worst part for me was when\\, just as Finn is about to die as a hero\\, Rose stops him\\, justifying it by saying that they need to win by \\\"saving what we love\\\" instead of \\\"killing what we hate\\\"... ouch! \\n\\nThe central problem is that Disney don't understand what made the originals good. Star Wars was a product of the 1970's\\, an epic tale of good vs. evil. The X-wings and lightsabers and aliens (even Yoda) may look like the ones in the original trilogy\\, but the heart and soul aren't there. The internet community resent that\\, it is not because \\\"it was not what I wanted\\\"\\, it is because the damage is too big that Star Wars might be gone... forever.","true":true}
