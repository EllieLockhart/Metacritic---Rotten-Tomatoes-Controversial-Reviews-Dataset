Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much\\, MUCH better after the 2nd viewing. I would still cut the entire Canto Bight subplot\\, but once my initial expectations were thoroughly dashed\\, I was able to fully enjoy it on its own terms.","true":true}
