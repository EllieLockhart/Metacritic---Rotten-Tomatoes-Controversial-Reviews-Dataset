Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie literally ruins Star Wars. This movie strategically tears apart everything from the past just to be able to build something new. This is horrible story telling beyond all the plot holes and political agenda in this film. They ruined Luke's character completely which alone would get a horrible rating from me but this movie was just bad. Ok sure the acting and visuals were superb but the story was just soooo bad and lazy.","true":true}
