Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When the dust settles I think most people will put this on a par with the prequels. It simply doesn't answer or even attemp to answer any of the interesting questions raised in The Force Awakens.... who are Reys parents? who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? unfortunately we still have absolutely no idea! And don't get me started on the slapstick humour........","true":true}
