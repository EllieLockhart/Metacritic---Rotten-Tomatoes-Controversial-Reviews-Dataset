Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is undoubtedly the worst Star Wars movie produced to date. This time around\\, audiences are treated to a movie riddled with inconsistencies that tarnish establish Star Wars lore and serve to cater to the progressive crowd\\, and nothing more. \\nNewly introduced characters are boring at their best\\, and absolutely unlikable at their worst. Mysteries established in The Force Awakens\\, such as\\, \\\"Who are Rey's parents?\\\" or \\\"Who is Snoke?\\\" Are pointlessly tossed to the side and disappointingly resolved\\, not with a bang\\, but with a pathetic whimper. Overall\\, this movie is the product of the director not knowing what in the world he's doing\\, and Disney shamelessly pushing agendas through pointless storylines\\, that is\\, everything in this movie having to do with a casino\\, or involving the new character\\, Rose\\, that detract from screen time that could have otherwise been spent on important characters like Snoke\\, Kylo Ren\\, or Rey. Luke Skywalker's character is ruined by this movie\\, by acts involving him being beaten in a skirmish by an untrained Rey (He never trains her in anything substantial\\, yet the movie treats her as if she had been)\\, or him being turned into a cowardly old man as opposed to an experienced Jedi.\\nOverall\\, this movie is disrespectful to long-time fans of the franchise and I highly recommend you spend your time watching Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi\\, which have very similar story beats to this film but respect the established universe.","true":true}
