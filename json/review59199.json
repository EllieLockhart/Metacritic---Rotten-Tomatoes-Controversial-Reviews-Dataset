Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Bad plot!!! Character ruined other characters that are loved from the fans of the game! That\u2019s not the story I was expecting from this game.The first game was epic and for the part 2 don\u2019t satisfy my expectations Graphics!!!!!That's the only good thing about this. Everything else is either mediocre or down right awful. The game play did not evolve one bit since the first game. It's still a walking simulator that's more a movie than a game\\, which would be enjoyable if it had a good story but God damn is it bad. The story simply broke my heart and not in the good way. It's like a spit in the face of the entire fan base. It's like the worst fan fiction you could possibly find. Seriously?  It's full of plot holes and the characters you fell in love with in the first game are completely ruined and you are forced to play with the character that ruined them. I don't mind the woke stuff but when so much of it is obviously forced down your throat it feels like the entire game was built around it so if people don't like it you can pull the victim card and say that they are ists and phobes and whatever. And the director to preach so much about sexualising women in games is bad only than to put that Abby scene in the game? I can't unsee that. What were you thinking? Let me tell you a little secret  game devs. People are playing games for entertainment and they'd rather see pretty things while doing it than ugl.. excuse me FUGLY ones! This is never going to change. How is sexualising men was never a problem? People don't like to be preached to and to be told what to think. In a video game setting\\, that choice should be always ours. Overall\\, I don't recommend this\\, especially if you were a fan of the previous one. maybe get it wen free from PlayStation plus\u2026 Expand","true":true}
