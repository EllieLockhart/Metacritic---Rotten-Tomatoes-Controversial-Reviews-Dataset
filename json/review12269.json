Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not looking forward to Rian Johnson's trilogy after seeing possibly the worst movie ever made the whole cinema was disappointed. They had opportunities to bring back people from the original trilogy and they didn't and a lot of forced jokes. The ending was terrible and would not recommend this movie to anyone I would have preferred to watch a handy cam horror. This movie will not be entering my star wars collection.","true":true}
