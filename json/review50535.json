{"101487":96904,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 Star is missing\\, because I think I\u2019m still a little butthurt I didn\u2019t get any back story on snoke before he was killed and the answer for Rey\u2019s parents was not satisfying especially when I have been thinking of theories for 2 years about it. Although I think the answer we got was still not correct\\, I went into the movie really wanting to know those two things\\, which hopefully we will find out more about in the next installment. I enjoyed the movie\\, it makes you laugh\\, has great action scenes\\, and the acting was great\\, especially Mark and Adam and daisy. I respect what the director did\\, because he could have done what everyone wanted\\, and answer everyone\u2019s questions\\, and made it very bland and predictable \\, but he took the story in a new direction\\, and threw EVERYONE a curve ball. The fact that it was completely different than what I thought would be was refreshing and actually helped me enjoy the movie more because I wasn\u2019t predicting it\u2019s every moves in my head. What people need to let go of is thinking these movies will be like how the prequels were... (lots of jedi everywhere with lightsabers with huge 45 minute lightsaber scenes as the finale of the movie...) because at this point In the story\\, Kylo and Rey are both still learning and nowhere near mastery and they are trying to break through the idea that the story is only about jedi and sith\\, but the FORCE as a whole and that there are different ways to use it and you don\u2019t have to pick a side\\, given the corruption of both the jedi and the sith from the the past. With opening up to new powers\\, new ideas\\, a new look on being a force user\\, they can really start to expand this universe that we know and love and it can evolve into something so much greater than the cookie cutter Star Wars recipe that everyone thought this movie should be. Some kudos on certain parts of the film: -stop complaining about the \u201cway\u201d Leia flew through space\\, the fact that we got to see her use powers for the first time\\, and the last\\, was amazing and it was an emotional scene and you should embrace that. -luke skywalker character was amazing and was a throwback to yoda when luke was young and met him and wanted to train. Loved the double tattooine sun before he faded and him busting out the Han Solo line to stick it to Kylo before he went. -stop complaining about how little time Rey got to train\\, luke did the same thing in the original trilogy and got to climb some vines and float some rocks for a few days then had to go face Darth Vader\\, then tried to return for more training later in jedi and yoda was like nope your good! Ughhhh and disappears. -could care less about rose and fin they replace boring storylines like having to watch r2d2 and c3po in the originals but their part of the story definitely shed some light on a bigger picture in the universe\\, that there is something a lot bigger out there than jedi\\, sith\\, first order\\, or rebellion\\, because these rich people are making money selling to both sides of the war which means the world we think was so big just got bigger and really opens up the possibility to expand and create new stories. -loved the way that yoda looked like he did in empire\\, brought me back to my childhood seeing him in that way because I hated the puppet and cgi yoda from the prequels. - loved the scenes where ray and kylos mind were connected\\, kind of gave you a sneak peak of what luke did later on but he was much more advanced of course. We will find out Rey\u2019s background in the last movie\\, and it will be great. She is too powerful and important to just have druggie parents that died on jakku. I\u2019m sure we will learn more about snoke at a later time but he is gone so it makes a lot more possibilities for the next story to be much farther in the future! Movie was funny\\, sad\\, had great action scenes and fighting scenes\\, and was a risk that was necessary to move Star Wars into the future. I am sorry for those that felt it ruined Star Wars forever and ruined their childhood but I enjoyed the film!! And I am going to watch it again soon!","true":true}
