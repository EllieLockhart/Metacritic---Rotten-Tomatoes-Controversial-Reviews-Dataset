Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me sick as a life-long fan of the franchise. How could they do this to Luke Skywalker and his fans? Any true Star Wars fan has to feel the same way.  There was no attempt made to honor the original characters or to even honor the story set up by TFA. Quite the contrary. It felt as if there was effort made to dishonor and wipe all of that away. Just disgusting. All that aside\\, it is also a terrible movie with a terrible script and cheesy unnecessary humor. Shameful. Sad. Also tired of all the condescension from Disney claiming that people not liking the movie are ignorant and unreasonable super-fans.  I had to give a star to get the post published. Doesn't deserve any star. Disney took a shit in my heart.","true":true}
