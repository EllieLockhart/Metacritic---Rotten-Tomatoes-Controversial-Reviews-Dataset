Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes\\, disney shoved down your throat elements\\, dismal humour\\, and characters not done justly. Left me with a lack of excitement for ep.9 and disappointed overall...Rian Johnson is a cold blooded butcher.","true":true}
