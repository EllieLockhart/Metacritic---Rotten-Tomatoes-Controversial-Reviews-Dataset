Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. This film just killed my desire to watch Episode 9 which I hope they just shelve or just go back to the original George Lucas treatment and consider this film just a bad dream.","true":true}
