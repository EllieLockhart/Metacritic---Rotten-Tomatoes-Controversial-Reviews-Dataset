Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a really bad movie. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because I am a huge Star Wars fan. I hope they can turn this around in the next movie. The Kylo Ren scene with Snoke and fighting the Imperial Guards was not even well choreographed. I would rate this ahead of episode 1 but not any of the other prequels and the prequels were not as good as the original trilogy. Also what was with the force connection thing?  That just did not work.","true":true}
