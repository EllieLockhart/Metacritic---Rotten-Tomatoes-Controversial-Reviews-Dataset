Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just...horrible. Ive never posted on rotten tomatoes but im convinced now every critic has been paid off by disney for puff pieces. Most disturbing things: luke says \\\"laser sword\\\" and tosses it over is shoulder and walks away when Rey gives it to him. WTF? This was an extremely emotional ending to TFA and luke just tosses his fathers light saber over his shoulder like a beer can. This moment i knew this movie was doomed. Then the poe prank call\\, and Rose or Jar Jar Tran absolutely horrible actress and character. I literally wanted to leave and go cry in my car.","true":true}
