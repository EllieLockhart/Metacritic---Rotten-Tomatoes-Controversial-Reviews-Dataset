Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. This was a great film. Star Wars was my childhood and has been a big part of my life. This might not be Empire\\, but it's still a great Star Wars movie. Stop complaining about tiny nitpicks and just enjoy a good movie.","true":true}
