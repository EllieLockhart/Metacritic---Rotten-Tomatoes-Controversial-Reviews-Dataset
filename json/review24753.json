Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much better than the Force Awakens but still no match for the original Lucas films. Which we will never get to experience again. Sadly. You could see the political correctness of our times all over this film. ","true":true}
