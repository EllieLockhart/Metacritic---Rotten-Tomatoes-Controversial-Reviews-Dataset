Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between the cringy moments\\, and the apparent lack of an attempt in synthesizing the storyline with its prequel (TFA)\\,  the out of character behaviour of my favourite heroes stunned me the most. Originality is key\\, however taking U-turns on the very essence of the protagonists who were central to Star Wars\\, makes this film difficult to connect with on a deeper level. A level that the franchise has always provided for me.\\n For some of the new cast\\, the acting in this film was on point\\, so was the cinematography and intensity. The quality of the film as a Sci-Fi story was also good however often fragmented.\\nOverall\\, I was disappointed\\, but it might be a good watch for somebody not interested in the franchise as a whole.","true":true}
