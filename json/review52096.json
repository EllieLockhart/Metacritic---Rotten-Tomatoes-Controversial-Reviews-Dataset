Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the Last Jedi\\, I believe this movie foundationally destroyed the Star Wars universe. So much has been done in this movie that cannot be reversed and I truly hold out hope that in the third one they start out with Princess Leia waking up from a terrible dream and we give this movie another go. Visually this movie definitely moved the needle. It was very well done on that front but the overall story is incredibly disappointing. No character development nor really good story line at all. Basically a build up in Force Awakens that then flat-lines in this film immediately. It visually looks like a Star Wars film but it is a wolf in sheep's clothing. This is not a true Star Wars story. Time for Disney to wake up now.","true":true}
