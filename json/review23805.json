{"101487":152713,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made this original comment on a Star Wars fan-forum\\, time to add my voice here to show we're not bots\\, it's not based on \\\"our theories\\\". The movie just sucks;\\n\\nWell\\, let's throw in my voice... the voice of utter disappointment.\\n\\nWhen coming out of Rogue One\\, which I loved\\, I was having high hopes for a \\\"new\\\" Star Wars story\\, rather than the rehash VII was. To my disappointment\\, VIII butchers it completely and utterly.\\n\\nSPOILERS!\\n\\n-Everyone\\, even those liking the movie\\, seem to agree on this; Casino planet sucked. Completely and utterly. It felt 100% earthy. Police rather than Security Forces (TSF anyone)? Really? REALLY? You can't even get these basic SW-premises correct. That was literally 100% earth. Keep that out of my Star Wars.\\n--Could have saved it with Lando Calrissian\\, but clearly Disney doesn't care that much about this franchise to do something right.\\n-Even disregarding the horrid planet Finn literally goes through his TFA loop (flee\\, fail\\, be heroic) AGAIN. We went over this already. And it's considerably worse here. Rose is a horrid throwaway character making Jar Jar look great. Really\\, I prefer him. By a ton.\\n-Finally for the first and ONLY time Finn has a purpose in this movie\\, his sacrifice\\, Rose screws it over. Here was your chance to actually not be 2 people dragging this movie down. Now you're just 2 people dragging the movie down and it would be lifted up 100-fold by being deleted.\\n-Not to mention their whole horrid plot relied on Poe not being told the plan. Why? Ehm... good question. Pretty much the rampant one in the movie.\\n\\nAway from that;\\n-Okay\\, we kicked the First Order\\, rebellion is great. We saw this end of TFA. But after the titles\\, it's no longer. Why? We don't know. Definitely can't be the Order's tactics since they took a sip of the dumb-potion between TFA where they weren't fully 100% stupid\\, and here were they are. Yet they are winning. Somehow. Uh huh.\\n-Humour. Too much\\, too bad. I liked several\\, but it was just too much. Star Wars contains humour\\, but this became just a parody.\\n-Snoke is build up in TFA. Tossed out in a whim. Nobody cares apparently.\\n-Same for Rey. Oh\\, that thousand year old prophecy about the strongest Jedi in the galaxy and all. Well\\, toss that out since 2 generations after they get 10x stronger. Without training 2 movies like both Anakin and Luke did.\\n-Did Luke train her at all? Of course not. Why did we even find Luke. I... really still have no idea after the whole movie. To spread hope? Through the hidden camera at the battle-field that programmed a battle live across the galaxy or something since the Rebellion certainly was in no shape to put the message forth. Somehow.\\n-Luke literally doing the Batman vs. Superman thing where Batman just had to pre-emptively kill Superman cause \\\"he *could* be evil. No sign\\, but he could\\, so he had to die.\\\" Not that that matches Luke nor Batman but screw that logic.\\n-Ren was apparently lured by Snoke. How\\, when\\, why? Oh right\\, still disposable character\\, can't actually go in depth on anything important.\\n-Phasma whatever is back. She's got a bigger role no... oh wait\\, no she's dead... nevermind.\\n\\n--- WHY DID NOBODY HYPERSPACE NUKE THE DEATH STAR. ENEMY FLEETS. KOTORS INFINITE FACTORY? MALACHOR? Oh right\\, cause in all previous movies going to hyperspace near a Star Destroyer just pushed them away. Way to retro the lore\\, badly.\\n\\n-Kylo is still this unhinged teen. No progression made at the end. I liked his scenes with Rey\\, but once Snoke was dead\\, he pretty much devolved into the raving madman lunatic again that does NOT make a proper leader and makes one fearful for IX (all my interest in it is dead). Hux hasn't fared much better being the Empire lunatic. How did they beat the New Republic again. I know they said they destroyed it at the start\\, but really\\, those 5 planets in TFA were the New Republic? Did this galaxy shrink when I wasn't looking?\\n-That fuel plot was just so... ugh. Cringe.\\n-That Force Cave was just utterly pointless visual fluff. What did we learn? Nothing. What was the point. There wasn't\\, much like most of this movie. Just throwing around \\\"Who cares. Shut off your brain and watch these explosions.\\\" \\\"But why?\\\" \\\"Who cares why. EXPLOSIONS!\\\"\\n-Yes\\, AT-AT's and AT-AT+. What do you mean\\, they do literally nothing the whole fight\\, not even move? What?\\n-Flying Leia. Really? Really. What. The. F...\\n\\n-Tracking device led to absolutely nowhere. Not only could it not resolve any TFA points\\, it can't even do it's own consistency well.\\n-Aside from Finn and Rose being 100% cut making the movie better the Splicer (oh wait\\, no\\, I mean code breaker. Can't go all Star Wars in our Star Wars movie) tells the First Order the whole plan Poe learns on ANOTHER SHIP independent from Finn and Rose. Ooookay\\, how? All he knows\\, like Finn is that they break the tracker\\, jump 6m\\, jolly jolly. Where did he get his magical knowledge from? Bad storytelling of course\\, like the whole rest of this movie.\\n\\nNow for the good stuff;\\n-I liked most of the interactions of Rey\\, Luke and Kylo.\\n-Some of the humour did work. Not the \\\"Yo Momma\\\" stuff though.\\n-Pretty.\\n-Kylo and Rey versus the Royal Guard was bad ass.\\n-They actually took some \\\"balance\\\" lessons from KOTOR2. Butchering them aside.\\n-I still like space battles (WHERE ARE THE Y-WINGS. WHAT ARE THESE BOMBERS?). You know\\, the actual battles. Not the South Park car-chase with the copcars and Cartmans wooden box.\\n-Finn's sacrifice was going great. Till they butchered that.\\n-I actually really like the crystal fox design. Yes\\, we're scrapping the barrel here.\\n\\n\\nThat's all that comes to mind to me right now. Really really disappointing\\, and I doubt I'll watch IX in the cinema. My interest in Star Wars movies is just... gone. And that's a shame since Rogue One was FREAKING AWESOME.","true":true}
