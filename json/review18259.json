Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought \\\"the force awakens\\\" was okay. I was looking forward to uncover the mysteries that we were presented in the previous movie. I wanted to see Luke teach Rey and I wanted to see the return of Luke Skywalker\\, the very last jedi. Possibly\\, a develop in Kylo Ren as well as the backstory of this super villain who came out of nowhere\\, supreme leader Snoke. The origin of Rey's parents\\, as well as the reason why Ben Solo became Kylo Ren. This movie disappointed me  because it utterly ignored what was set up in \\\"the force awakens\\\"\\, it completely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker\\, turning him into a senile old joke\\, it gave Rey's character zero depth and zero reasons to back up her absurdly enormous powers... it's just this. It simply failed to deliver. On the other hand I felt preached about politics and feminism and I found that not only distasteful but most of all out of place. If I go to watch start wars\\, I wanna watch a star wars movie. This movie was visually stunning and the sounds were great. But when I watch a movie\\, that's the last thing that concerns me. First of all\\, I want to enjoy the plot. This movie has no plot (the story is literally stuck) and apart from Poe none of the characters has an arc. This is a movie I wish was deleted and remade from scratch\\, so it wouldn't hurt this current trilogy as well as the myth of the original one.","true":true}
