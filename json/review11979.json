Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely adore this movie and would give it a third thumb up if I had the extra thumb. The idea that fans are so dramatically split down the middle is kind of shocking to me but I'd be interested to see how opinion about this movie changes over time.","true":true}
