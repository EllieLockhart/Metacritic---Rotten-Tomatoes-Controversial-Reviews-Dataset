Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie and I'm a huge Star Wars fan.  Le\u00eda flying her dead body in space and the rebel fleet \\\"chase\\\" scenes until they run out of fuel is sooooooooo dumb.  Empire ships ever think of light speed to the other side where the ships are heading to then cut them off?  I mean come on\\, dumbest so called \\\"challenge\\\" to the fans from \\\"director\\\" Rain Johnson I have ever seen.   Please Disney\\, let this director go to another studio\\, he is awful.","true":true}
