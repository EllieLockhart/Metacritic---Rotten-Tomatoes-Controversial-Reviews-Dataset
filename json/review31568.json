Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much just doesn't make sense and why is half the script just full of jokes?  Star wars was never a comedy but seems to be now.   Disney were saying it was going to be the darkest star wars ever.","true":true}
