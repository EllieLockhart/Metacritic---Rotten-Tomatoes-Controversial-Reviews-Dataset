Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My worst fears have come true. When I found out Disney had purchased Lucasfilm\\, I was sure they would mess up Star Wars royally and I was right. The end of the Skywalker saga has already happened and the last movie hasn't even come out yet. For Disney to throw out all books written after Return of the Jedi was insane. The books were really good and would have made even better movies. I'm surprised George Lucas hasn't slammed Disney himself for what they have done to the ending trilogy of his saga. The movie was entertaining but had too much comedy and smart-assness. VII Han's death sentence\\, VIII was Luke's and IX probably would have been Leia's if she hadn't passed away in real life.  If this would have been an episode I\\, II and III of a new saga the movies would have been really good with the new characters and their development but not as an ending to the one that had already been started.","true":true}
