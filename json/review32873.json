Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars wasnt bad but it certainly wont be rewatched anytime soon. How many things do we have to watch the lame rebels scramble to blow up? Many scenes in this movie could of been done without all together. They were not written\/directed\/acted poorly\\, just had no bearing on the plot and served only to lengthen the movie to get more cgi action scenes in it. Its not bad...its just painfully average and long.","true":true}
