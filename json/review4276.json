Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars yet!  What sets me off is they've STILL not explained who the Snoke is and how he got to be the new leader.  Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder is symbolic of Rian Johnson's treatment of the entire Star Wars mythos.   Leia flying through space... Disney seems to be trying to carry over the exact same formula they used for Pirates of the Caribbean.  So many others to list.  Totally not Star Wars anymore.","true":true}
