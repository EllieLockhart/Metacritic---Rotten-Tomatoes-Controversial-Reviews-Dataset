Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. The main story of the first order slowly chasing the last of the resistance ships was so stupid and boring. Luke skywalker's character was completely ruined and made a fool in this film. No 2 lightsabers actually clashed in this film. Finn 30 min scene on the casino planet added nothing to the story. The foundation concept of the force has been thrown out the window\\, now anyone can use it\\, even kids without training. Snoke dies without any backstory\\, rey has no meaningful parents we don't even learn their names. The Knights of Ren have no mention. Luke dies in such a lame way and gets into a little fight with rey and she beats him\\, luke is the same guy who destroyed the Empire\\, darth Vader\\, a death star and survived on hoth nearly freezing to death. But somehow rey is already stronger. Revenge of the sith is much better than this film even if it's full of cgi because the story had continuity and made sense.","true":true}
