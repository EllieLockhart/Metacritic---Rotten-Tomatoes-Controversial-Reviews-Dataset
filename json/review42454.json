Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was a good movie if you know nothing about Star Wars. It got everything wrong about the New Republic and Luke Skywalker. In the last movie\\, The Force Awakens\\, the New Republic was destroyed. According to the Star Wars book timeline\\, Luke would've been 44 years old when that happened. Disney absolutely ruined Star Wars by buying it. They should remake both movies\\, reading all of the books\\, and following all of the facts.","true":true}
