Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The buildup in TFA for Rey and Luke to meet had me excited with anticipation. Unfortunately it was a big let down and while the internal battle\/conflict Luke had with the force was intriguing\\, I felt like it was anti-climatic and lackluster. Plus there were several scenes that dragged on for longer than needed and\/or just didn't make sense logistically. The plot holes were too glaring to ignore.\\n\\nThe scenes I enjoyed\\, the final showdown between Luke and Kylo and Rey and Kylo working together\\, were beautifully choreographed and well executed. The cinematography was beautiful but that's where The Last Jedi stops for me.","true":true}
