Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much fun! The almost 3 hours felt like 1. Kylo Ren is the new teenage geeky girl heart throb (Legolas your time has come and gone)\\, which is great for the youngins just getting into Star Wars\\, and Luke Skywalker does not disappoint for those of us who have grown up with the series. I loved when Luke shows the force to Rae\\, and how they showed the conflict in Luke. Ben wasn't the only one conflicted. It is great and very human.","true":true}
