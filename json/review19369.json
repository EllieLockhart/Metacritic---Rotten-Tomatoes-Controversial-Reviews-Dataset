Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s really baffling to see that Rian Johnson and Disney\\, when taking on the responsibility of continuing such an influential story\\, just don\u2019t understand the heart and themes and characters of Star Wars. More than anything The Last Jedi is one of those reflections of our current culture and Hollywood in general. It\u2019s fun\\, it\u2019s enjoyable\\, and it\u2019s devoid of substance or value.
