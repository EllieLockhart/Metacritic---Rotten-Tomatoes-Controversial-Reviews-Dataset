Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best looking film in the franchise introduces magnificent new locations expanding the ever growing star wars universe\\, and some new characters along the way\\, also not forgetting the return of some favourites. However the way Luke Skywalker was handled was simply wrong. While occasionally seeing your hero in a rough state can be good (like peter parker in into the multiverse) it usually ends with the character returning to the person we know and love. Sadly this was not one of those occasions.","true":true}
