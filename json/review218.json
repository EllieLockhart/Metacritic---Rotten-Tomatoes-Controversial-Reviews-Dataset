I really dig the different fighting styles\\, and the different tracks playing behind the fighting styles. The story is so gritty\\, so violent\\, so dreary\\, and so **** enjoyable. The cutscenes boast powerful vocal performances and always grip your attention. They give you a pair of two great main characters. Kiryu and Majima are so unique. Kiryu is a straight-faced\\, no **** kind of dude with a good heart\\, and seeing him in the situations he's put through is interesting and often humorous. Majima is a showman\\, stealing every cutscene he's in. He has this cool air about him\\, he is confident and clever in and out of battle. Just off these elements alone\\, you've got a fantastic video game...\r\rBut god damn is this game FUNNY. Like\\, holy **** it's straight up hilarious. There are so many encounters\\, so many events in Yakuza 0 that you can just stumble upon\\, and they're each funny\\, in the most wonderful Japanese way possible. It is your favorite comedy anime\\, fully playable. The dialogue is so well-written. It is absolutely corny at times\\, but it is always self-aware.\r\rIt is such a sweet mix. You get this intense\\, angry main story; then you explore Kamurocho and bump into a clown who gives you free **** Or maybe you **** meet Michael Jackson. You **** do. You do and it's as ridiculous as you want it to be.\r\rMy ONLY gripe\\, and it is kind of a big one\\, is the map. It is a little snug in Kamurocho. It really feels limited and\\, while there's always something to do\\, you can't help but feel like there's not enough room to do it in.\r\rListen; Yakuza 0 is a masterpiece. It's so out there. It's so oddball. It's so much fun.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
