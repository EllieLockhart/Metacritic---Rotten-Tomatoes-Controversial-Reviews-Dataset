Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not perfect (there is one particular storyline that drags down the 2 main storylines)\\, The Last Jedi delivers on emotional storytelling\\, compelling themes\\, and unexpected developments. \\n\\nIt featured some of the best and most original action pieces in the Star Wars canon. The acting (particularly from Mark Hamilton\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Adam Driver\\, and Daisy Ridley) was impeccable. Emotionally\\, it struck a great balance between moments of humour\\, triumph\\, and sadness. \\n\\nI look forward to seeing where the story goes from here.","true":true}
