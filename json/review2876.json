Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. The worst of all the Star Wars movies...an that's saying something when you consider the prequels had Jar Jar Binks. This movie serves no purpose except to totally decimate everything that you loved about Star Wars since first seeing the opening crawl in 1977. This will be the first SW movie that I will see only once. The damage is done and unless they throw this 'episode\\\" away and remove it from canon\\, I don't think it will ever get back on track. Such a sad waste. On the plus side\\, I'll have more money in my pocket since i won't be buying SW books\\, toys\\, games\\, etc.","true":true}
