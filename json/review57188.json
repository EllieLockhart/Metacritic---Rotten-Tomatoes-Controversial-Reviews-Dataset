Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst main Star wars movie so far.\\n\\nIt tries to be surprising for surprising sake and makes little sense in way of plot or characters. They did succeed in surprising me. I'm surprised they made this piece of trash.\\n\\nA very nihilistic movie with so much grey you can't care about the poorly written new characters. At this point the only character with depth is Kylo.\\n\\nI've watched every one since empire in the theaters since I was a kid. No more. They even destroyed any plots they had created in awakens. RIP Star wars.","true":true}
