Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As I was driving to the cinema with my friends to watch The Last Jedi on boxing day I said \\\"I Fucking hate Star Wars films. Why are we going to see this? Why don't we go and see a good movie?\\\" But they were like no\\, this is Boxing Day\\, we have to go and see the Family Friendly Blockbuster and Star Wars is it. So we went to this film and I got a couple of big beers and snuck them into the cinema and braced myself. And the opening scroll started and for the first time it actually made sense\\, and in a way where I was prepped and excited for the rest of the film. By the end of the first scene I was crying a little bit. This is the most emotionally cohesive emotional roller coaster I've experienced in a long time. This was a Star Wars that made me feel things\\, and care about what was happening\\, and critiqued 'hero boy' culture and made me dream of holding a lightsaber (literally I had a dream the other night and it was really cool).","true":true}
