Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert....\\nThe problem with the movie is that it has nothing to do with the first one and it doesnt feel like a trilogy. They dismiss everything they did at the first movie evrything.\\n\\nIts not a bad movie i like the movie but is a bad second part of a trilogy\\, its a bad Star wars Movie Probably as bad as Episode 1 or 2.","true":true}
