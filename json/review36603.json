Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a bold and interesting character study directing and pushing characters old and new.What they do is unexpected\\, yet falls perfectly in line with who the characters have been and who they've become. As with any big risk taking films\\, those risks will land for some\\, and fall flat for others. You'll see a lot of people say it's a fantastic film\\, while others will say \\\"IT RUINED STAR WARS! WHYYY?\\\" I think that's a testament to the movie. It's so rare these days\\, especially in the large hollywood machine\\, for a film to be truly surprising or different. Everything is always played safe\\, because no company wants to hurt their bottom line. I'm glad Disney decided they had enough margin to let Rian take interesting artistic risks with the characters and plot.\\n\\nYes\\, some things in this movie weren't great. The first act is very messy\\, the Casino side quest is a bit meaningless\\, it's a bit convoluted\\, and it's a bit CGI heavy\\, but this movie as a bit of a mess is a far richer and more interesting story than the Force Awakens was as a clean and straight forward film.","true":true}
