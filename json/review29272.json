Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey don\u00b4t do anything.\\nFinn don\u00b4t do anything.\\nPoe don\u00b4t do anything.\\nLeia don\u00b4t  do anything\\, except by flight like Superman...\\nPorgs don\u00b4t serve for nothing.
