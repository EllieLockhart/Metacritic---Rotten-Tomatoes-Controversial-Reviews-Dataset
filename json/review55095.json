Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want my money back.  I wish I'd never seen this movie.  The magic of Star Wars is gone for me.\\n\\nWhether or not Star Wars was meant to be a story about the Skywalker family\\, what it became was a story about Anakin\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, and Han.  There are better ways to send off perhaps the most iconic characters in cinematic history for the sake of change than what Disney has done.\\n\\nThis film was misandrous\\, and I say this as a proponent of strong female protagonists.  I was personally raised by women\\, and my lifelong hero has been a strong woman who passed 26 years ago.\\n\\nI don't want to pay to watch current American or even global politics in a film that should be timeless.  There is a reason the NFL has lost viewership.\\n\\nYes\\, there is quasi science in Star Wars\\, but to completely defy certain laws or logic of science is downright stupid.  Apparently spaceships hold a gravitational force and bombers have no defense and fly super slow.  So much more idiotic logic in this movie.\\n\\nI would not have been surprised if a T-Rex wearing a cape and a laser beam coming out of its hand flew across the screen while motionless but doing somersaults... in space.  Seriously.\\n\\nIF ep VIII is simply a red herring\\, then it would have been a complete waste of time and resources and I'll be even more pissed that I had to wait 4+ years for any reason to ep VII.\\n\\nOnly thing I can do is answer with my wallet.  I am not excited for ep IX\\, and I will not see another Star Wars film or side story in the theater ever again.","true":true}
