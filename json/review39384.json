Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is my favorite Star Wars movie to date. It has a compelling and unpredictable plot\\, amazing visuals\\, and even though it is a seperaration from the previous movies in terms of story archs\\, it has the core theme that make a great Star Wars film: a genuine conflict between good and evil in each character and the possibility for redemption in a fallen world.","true":true}
