Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was an entertaining piece of garbage.  It wasn't a particularly well-made film\\, let alone a Star Wars film (actually\\, the Phantom Menace is better) with gaping plot holes\\, pointless side quests\\, ill-timed campy humor\\, and characters betraying their well-understood traits.  This basically wan't a Star Wars movie\\, since the last Jedi himself basically said the Dark and Light side of the force doesn't matter.  So much for a 40-year legacy.","true":true}
