Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a bad movie\\, but I think that its biggest failing was that it completely failed to set up anything interesting breadcrumbs or plot points to take up in the next movie.\\n\\nI left the film underwhelmed and without any desire to see what happens to the 20 resistance fighters that are left\\, emo Ren or ridiculously good-at-everything Rey.","true":true}
