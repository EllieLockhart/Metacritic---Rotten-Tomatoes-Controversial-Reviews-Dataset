Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion this is the worst film in the franchise. 1.Leia's survival of the cold vacuum of outer space feels off\\, like something I would have come up for my action figures when I was 9.                                                                                            2. Luke deserves a better death\\, in the end he gave his life to serve as a distraction so his friends could slip out the back door. If Luke had to die (and he didn't)\\, then it should have been striking a decisive blow against the dark side. No sabers even clashed!                                                                                           3. Most importantly\\, Rian Johnson just effectively wiped out the name Skywalker from the future of the franchise... Leia isn't likely to have anymore children\\, Rey isn't a Skywalker\\, that leaves only Kylo (Ben). He is technically a Solo\\, not a Skywalker even if he were to be \\\"redeemed\\\" by the end of the next episode. That however is unlikely as I'm sure JJ Abrams is weary of anymore comparisons to the original trilogy and to do so would surely invite unwanted criticism that he copied the story of Vader in young Kylo. So\\, we are left (as far as we know and can reasonably guess) with no one to carry on the Skywalker name in the future of the franchise. It should come as no surprise that this is a huge disappointment to long-time fans.","true":true}
