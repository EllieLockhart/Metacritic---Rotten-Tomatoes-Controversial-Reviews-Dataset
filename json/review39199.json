Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film breaks Star Wars. It has little to nothing in common with the tone of the films it is supposed to succeed and\\, even if you forget the legacy films\\, was on its own a BAD movie.","true":true}
