{"101487":138279,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Instead of writing a review for this piece of shit film that literally doubled down on one of the greatest cinematic opportunities in the modern world\\, I would like to give my take on what should have actually happened in this film\\, given the polarizing effects of the previous film\\, The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThis movie came after the polarizing film The Force Awakens. A lot of die hard Star Wars fans felt as though it didn't live up to the hype of the reboot of the series (main gripes being that this was a modded copy of A New Hope). The force awakens went on to set up one of the most interesting cliffhangers in all of cinema.  Rey shows up to the infamous Luke Skywalker\\, and leaves us wondering what the fuck was about to happen next. \\n\\nFor the next two years an absurd number of theories surfaced that made the setup for the Last Jedi almost poetic. The mysterious villain (who we still know fucking NOTHING about) seemed to have an epic plan to help the First Order recover from their loss of the Mega Death star. He then calls for Kylo Ren to return to him to complete his training.  This act forces the audience to believe that we are about to see Kylo reach new heights in his use of the dark side of the force. \\n\\nRey is literally the most mysterious force user upon her introduction. The Force Awakens sets her up as a descendant of some top tier force user.  In the film they even go as to far as to use Alan Mcguiness' voice blended with Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi during a force vision when she touches Luke Skywalker's lightsaber. So obviously\\, a member of the audience would be poised for a HUGE realization as to her lineage.\\n\\nWhat should have happened:\\n\\nRey hands Luke his Lightsaber and he immediately decides that he should train Rey and together they would right his wrongs so that he may in fact live without the cloud of regret that he feels from Kylo's turn to the darkside.  He tells her the truth about the events that conspired to Kylo's demise (while immediately admitting he had a thought about killing him). Rey then forgives him and tells him that the only thing that matters is the end. Luke\\, inspired by Rey's speech\\, then goes on to admit that he has felt a pull from the dark side of the force. HE explains that force users can be twice as powerful if they embody both sides of the force. HE then tells of the rage he felt when battling his father (Darth Vader) during their final battle during the Return of the Jedi. He eventually shows that has learned the ability of force lightning (except is is green due to his embodiment of the light side of the force as well).  \\n\\nMean while\\, Kylo Ren and Snoke are aboard his ship\\, and he scorns Kylo about his defeat at the hands of Rey at the end of the force awakens. He admits that he wasn't prepared to handle another force user. He had gotten used to being the only saber weilder and the battle with Rey caught him off guard. He admits he was weak\\, and fully submits to Snoke's final arch of training in the dark side of the force (considering that he has spiraled down into a dark place from the act of murdering his father in the previous film). Snoke then trains Kylo with special attention in the art of the lightsaber (seeing as how he was bested by Rey in the last film).\\n\\nUpon Rey's completion of training in the art of embodying both the light and dark sides of the force\\, Luke then raises his old X Wing out of the sea. They then fix it (while reminiscing about Luke and Han working on the Falcon)\\, and set out to find Snoke and Kylo and cut the head off of the first order. \\n\\nUpon Kylo's completion of training\\, Snoke reveals his biggest secret.\\n\\nHis name is not Snoke\\, but he is actually Darth Plagueis. He then senses the resistance approcaching his ship on the edge of the outer realm (led by Poe Dameron\\, Leia\\, and Admiral Ackbar). A huge space battle ensues and upon the eradication of the resisitance (seeing as how Snoke's ship is the most deadly ship in the star wars cannon)\\, Luke and Rey show up in the clutch in the X Wing.\\n\\nKylo and Snoke realize that they are here\\, and they broadcast a transmission that challenges them to a formal duel\\, winner rules the galaxy. Luke and Rey accept and board Snoke's ship. In Snoke's throne room Snoke greets Luke with great excitement. It is then revealed that Snoke placed all of the emporer's ideas into his head after he thought he had murder his master (Darth Plagueis). He bided his time to wait until the Lord Vader had completed the Sith cycle by killing his master\\, and that he had broken it by having Kylo being initially trained in the light side of the force. He has done his work for him. This enrages Luke and he immediately charges straight for Snoke. Rey caught of guard\\, is attacked by Kylo and a huge lightsabwer duel ensues. Snoke and Luke fight towards one direction\\, and Rey and Kylo head towards another. After crazy lightsaber mastery\\, Snoke cuts of Luke's legs\\, and prepares for his execution.  He then thanks Luke for bring him the grandaughter of his apprentice (Darth Sidious)\\, and now he would turn her to the dark side. Luke's final words are Rey will never turn to the dark side because she is already trained in it (Luke had previously mastered the dark side force powers prior to Kylo's maturity). Snoke then executes Luke (an honorable death).\\n\\nMean while\\, Rey and Kylo have fought all the way to the front of the ship (the space battle is going on int the window). She is winded and Kylo seems to be coming in the for the kill. She then tells him of how she feels the light in him\\, and offers to try to teach him how to embody both sides of the force. She tells him that this is the only way he will truly become more powerful than his grandfather\\, Darth Vader. Together\\, they could take down Snoke and end the reign of suffering that the first order has brought upon the universe. Kylo then agrees\\, saying that he wish he wouldn't have killed his father. Luke was the closest thing he had to a proper father\\, and he could sense that he had died.\\n\\nAt this point Snoke arrives on the bridge and commands Kylo to finish off Rey. After a tense moment\\, he turns on Snoke and tries to force push him through the glass. Snoke deflects it and the camera pans to show Poe Dameron shoot a missle towards Snoke. He then retreats to a near by escape pod\\, and leaves in search of the remnants of the knights of Ren. \\n\\nAm I wrong or nah?","true":true}
