Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh take on the movie franchise we know and love. Far more original than the force awakens\\, a good transition to get ready for an ending that will definitely be different from the original trilogy and prequels. Kudos to Lucas who had an open invite to the set. He only came once for two hours; his biggest advice was to not waste time creating tangible sets for scenes in space with hanging props. It's ok to use cgi. And any scene with a a real body in it make sure the surrounding is real. Multiple settings and story lines bouncing characters all Star Wars movies some more interesting than others but all merging to one film that is the Last Jedi.","true":true}
