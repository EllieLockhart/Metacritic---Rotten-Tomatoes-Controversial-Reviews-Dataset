Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trust the critics not the fans. A lot of fans have been dishonest from the start\\, failing the movie before it was even on the screen! These fans have NO imagination\\, and would like to see the SAME movie over and over again but fortunately Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a bold\\, new ambitious vision... delivers surprising punches\\, twists\\, unexpected character developments while honoring the saga's rich legacy and delivers all the emotion rich punch we could hope for.","true":true}
