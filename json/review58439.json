Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All continuity of the saga up to this point seem to have been reset to Star Wars' square one. All signs of legitimate character development have been emotionally re molded to fit the metaphorical (toy) molds of the exact character traits  that fit the original series so well to trick the younger generation into getting the same feeling the original created ; seemingly forgetting that lots of living human beings own physical and digital copies of the original star Wars' trilogy \\nthat take place in the canon before \\\"The Last Jedi\\\". The writing was genuinely Jarring to anyone who has seen any of those movies prior. Like everything has been reset. Could have done better myself! 1 star because I don't want my review to be taken down by  D I S N 3 Y","true":true}
