Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Came into the theater with high expectations following TFA only to come out disappointed. This movie had the same plot points as Empire and Return of the Jedi\\, the characters were under developed\\, and most importantly\\, this did not feel like a SW film. TLJ had a weak and boring plot\\, but there being so many storylines going on simultaneously (Rey\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, Kylo\\, etc) made this movie go back and forth too much. Overall this is not the movie most audiences were expecting following JJ Abrams' brilliant episode 7. I am looking forward to how these issues are fixed in the next episode and will optimistically attend regardless.","true":true}
