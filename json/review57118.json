Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is from a huge Star Wars fan. I read the books\\, watched Clone Wars\\, Rebels\\, played KoTOR\\, etc. \\nI wanted nothing more than to love this movie\\, and will give it another try\\, but Rian Johnson made huge mistakes that are simply unforgiveable. \\nThis has all the tonal feel of a Marvel movie\\, spends an nonsensical amount of time on irrelevant side quests while taking minimal or zero time addressing the most central questions that would make this narrative coherent.\\n\\nLuke's rescuing of his father from the Dark Side\\, resisting the Emperor and the defeat of the Empire were made into worthless trivial events. \\\"Let the past die\\\" \\n\\nOn top of that\\, there was some Prequel-level CGI characters that most of TFA seemed to work so hard to correct (except Snoke).  In all a massive disappointment from what could have been so promising.","true":true}
