Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a movie you would love to completely hate especially given the hype from fans and critics alike. I went in to see this movie with high expectations and left feeling moderately engaged but slightly disappointed with the way things took for a turn. There are several moments in this movie that are shocking\\, unexpected and hugely satisfying. There were other moments when I had felt the scenes were unnecessary\\, and lacking any sort of emotional heft (the constant comedy in the midst of the chaos made me long for the war-inspired Rogue One). The acting is still aces\\, the score is still the same score we had grown to love\\, the action scenes are terrific\\, the story....let me give it another viewing\\, probably when it comes out on Blu-ray.
