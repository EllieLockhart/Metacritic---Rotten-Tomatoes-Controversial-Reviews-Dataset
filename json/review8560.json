Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Firstly - Its a good Movie - There is a lot of hype and arguments about it but as a movie its excellently made however with so many people have their own passionate theories and ideas about what should happen\\, it strikes many emotional cords that don't sit well with everyone.\\n\\nI have now seen the movie three times and as a result\\, my feelings have changed with each watch. After my first watch\\, I felt like many did\\, puzzled at the choices made and unhappy with many of those decisions. There were things I hoped to see but didn't and I things I didn't want to and did. After lots of discussion and contemplation as to what and why\\, I went again and having had time to dwell on those story points\\, began to understand the reasoning and my feelings began to change and again with my third viewing. \\n\\nHaving now seen it three times I can sit and watch comfortably\\, enjoying those controversial desisions\\, in fact\\, I will probably see the movie at least one more time in the cinema while I can.\\n\\nIf you have seen it once\\, I suggest watching some online reviews\\, and going to see it again.\\nWhen I first walked out I would have given it less than 3 star. I can now easily give it a 4.","true":true}
