Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cam out of the movie feeling \\\"guttered\\\". So many things i was angry about that has probably ruined the current trilogy for me. The current trilogy had so much potential\\, only to leave me with feeling no hype at all towards episode 9. All i can really look forward to now are the standalone films. Bring on Solo and OB1!","true":true}
