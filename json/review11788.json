Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How is it even possible for a movie so depressingly insipid? The entire audience walked out of the theater completely shell-shocked. It really is hard to tell what was worse: the writing\\, the pacing\\, the embarrassing plot holes and cringe-worthy characterization... in a franchise that first and foremost has always been about good old-fashioned storytelling TLJ didn't even give us one coherent storyline to hang onto for dear life through this miserable hellish ride. I don't know which movie all these 'critics' saw but it can't possibly be the same one as we did.","true":true}
