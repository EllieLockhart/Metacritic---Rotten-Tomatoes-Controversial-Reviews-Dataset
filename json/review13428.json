Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this film. It is obvious\\, however\\, that this is a Disney movie. It relies a little too much on humor at the expense of any real tension. Overall though I enjoyed the experience. I particully found it interesting how they treated the character of Luke Skywalker. Everything he does is based on the lessons he got from Yoda in the Empire Strikes back. I found this clever\\, though some fans on the internet were disappointed by this. Aside from some of the unnecessary humor\\, I found this to be one of the better films in the series.","true":true}
