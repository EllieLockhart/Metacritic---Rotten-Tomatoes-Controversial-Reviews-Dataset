Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star for the nice first and last scenes. The rest of the film is a disgrace to the starwars legacy and a social justice advertisement. Rose is extremely anoying\\, as is Rey. And why did my childhood hero Luke had to  end up as a grumpy old men and just vanish without actualy doing some real hero-stuff. What  a shame.","true":true}
