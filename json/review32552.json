Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi fell flat for me. The actors are good\\, but the story is completely tone-deaf not only to the tenor of the existing Star Wars universe\\, but more importantly to the arc created in the first movie of this trilogy. I feel as if Rian Johnson at each juncture\\, intentionally chose the path for his existing characters that flew in the face of what long-time fans expected. Thus the new characters become one dimensional and the old characters are simply new people with old names- they are written almost completely opposite of the established personalities of the characters from the original trilogy and EU.","true":true}
