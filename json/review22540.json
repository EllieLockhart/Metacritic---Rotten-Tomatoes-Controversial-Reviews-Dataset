Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's get one thing out of the way\\, if you expect this to be like Rouge one with dull characters and a predictable story that doesnt challenge the audiences expectations\\, then yes\\, you'll be disappointed by this movie. However if you are looking for a fun Star Wars movie that offers an unexpected story with plenty of depth and challenges the audience\\, you are in for a treat. In time we will look back at these complaints as laughable and realize that the story had that much of an impact on people. If you look back at the history of Star Wars you'll see the same thing happened after the release of what is considered to be the greatest Star Wars movie ever made\\, The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
