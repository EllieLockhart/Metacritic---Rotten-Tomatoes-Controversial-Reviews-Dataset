Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to even begin. By far the worst SW movie ever IMO. You dont see it at first\\, but give it time and you will: the lazy writing\\, the even lazier directing. I mean 40 years of Star Wars world and now we suppose to just watch a two hour long chase - a chase that makes no sense at all. The whole saga started with a similar chase that took 90 seconds. The technology and ships got worse? \\nAnd Leia? After we fell in love with her because of her courage and witt and after being the leader of the rebels for 40 years...we now se a nice old lady that is not really sure of what to say or do? There is a pilot that disobeys her direct order and everyone else with him!? I mean\\,comon!!! She would be sharp and ruthless by now or at least tactically prepared for anything\\, she would have seen it all before...\\nLuke? oh god why. I mean- the same guy that refused to kill Darth Vader because he believed that theres still some good in him - is now capable of killing a young son of his sister...WOW","true":true}
