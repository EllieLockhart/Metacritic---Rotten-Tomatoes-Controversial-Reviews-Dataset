Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously\\, how much does Disney pay these professional reviewers?\\n91%? Did you accidentally walk into the Joker\\, and somehow thought you were watching Episode 9? This was a muddled ball of derp\\, visually stunning (of course) but as idiotic...if not more than the last. Save your money\\, wait for it to drop on D+ in a few months...and at that time you can wish that Star Wars had not gone out like Game of Thrones did.","true":true}
