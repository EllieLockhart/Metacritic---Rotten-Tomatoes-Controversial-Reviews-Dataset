Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, I'm shocked at all the negative reviews! People need to get a grip. The movie was fantastic and new and had great character development and people need to stop hating one film for being too similar to the originals and then hating another for being too different (or just basically having tantrums because it didn't go the way they wanted it). A great film\\, Rian and the actors have done star wars justice!","true":true}
