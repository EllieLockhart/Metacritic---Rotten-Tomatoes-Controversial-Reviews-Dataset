Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how so many people have given this poor ratings. Not only was it entertaining from start to finish. There were many twists. Thoroughly enjoyed it!","true":true}
