Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down\\, the best Star Wars content ever created (in my opinion\\, of course). This was a long movie\\, but it was so good you never wanted it to end. The scenes were long as well\\, there wasn't any cutting back and forth to different characters\\, which made it feel a lot more cohesive. And each of these larger scenes was massive in scale and epic and so whenever one ended\\, I kept thinking \\\"Well gee\\, this has got to be the end of the movie right? No. It kept going for another hour or so after that.\\\" The Last Jedi really had everything you could want in a Science Fiction\\, fantasy adventure movie. Unlike some of the more recent Star Wars films\\, the Last Jedi had real Light Saber battles - and quite a few of them. It had Stellar space-combat\\, and each of our classic beloved Star Wars characters got plenty of screen time. I was also pleasently surprised by how unpredictable it was. From the trailer everyone had all these preconceived notions and speculations and without spoiling\\, I can sad that it was absolutely unpredictable. \\n\\nNow lets take a second to talk about the Porgs. They were perfect\\, and I want a whole fleet of them. Can anyone sell me a Porg? \\n\\n10\/10\\, 97%","true":true}
