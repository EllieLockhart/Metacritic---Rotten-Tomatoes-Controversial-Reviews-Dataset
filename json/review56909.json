Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Skywalker saga ended with Return of the Jedi\\, this is a fresh new trilogy and I don't even think Rey will come out on top of the next film.  They are setting up the next trilogy splendidly\\, with the promise of new Force users\\, not constricted by the rules of any order.   I find it strange that people are judging this trilogy when it hasn't been completed yet.","true":true}
