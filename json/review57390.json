Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucks! The director destroyed one of the greatest characters of all time ... Luke Skywalker. Luke\\, from single-handedly bringing down the Emperor and Darth Vader to now being scared to do anything and staying in his island elderly care center. On the bad guys side\\, Snoke was dumb enough to be betrayed and chopped like an onion just when he was saying that nobody could betray him. Kylo needs help to beat the pretorians ... what a difference with Darth Vader\\, Count Doku\\, Darth Maul\\, Palpatine. The bad guys were just lame ... a couple bums that tried to be bad guys and playing with light sabers. On another main character\\, Rey was doing great in the Force Awakens and during half of this movie\\, I was really looking forward to learn her origins .... daughter of Obi-Wan\\, Luke\\, Han Solo ... but of course\\, no epic origins at all; she was just sold by her parents for alcohol. I have the feeling that this new \\\"director\\\" was fighting inner ghosts of not being able to do anything comparable to the original trilogies and decided to just destroy it all .... and also trying to come out with some new and shocking story elements but at the same time trying not to follow theories posted by fans that at the end he just made a bunch of non sense in the name of \\\"originality\\\". The theories that Snoke was Darth Plagueis and that Rey was daugther or Obi-Was were really cool; a great movie and story could come out of that. This director should not be allowed to touch any Star Wars film\/series\/book\/toy\/mugs\/toys for ever!!! He should move to a Galaxy Far Far Away.","true":true}
