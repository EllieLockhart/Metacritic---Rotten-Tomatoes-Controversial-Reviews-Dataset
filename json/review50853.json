Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold new Star Wars film that isn't afraid to take chances. Not every chance pays off\\, but overall the film gives fans the Star Wars experience they've been waiting for\\, even more so than The Force Awakens. My main point of criticism is that there is about 20 minutes that should have been cut\\, and the pacing is a tad off. Still\\, it's a solid film with much to love.","true":true}
