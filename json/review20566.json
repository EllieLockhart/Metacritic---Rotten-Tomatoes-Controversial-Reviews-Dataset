Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been so dissapointed in a movie (and i didn't expect it to be better than any of the originals either). It's not a bad move by itself\\, but the writing\\, plotting and tone are some of the worst of the series (and considering the prequels that's saying quite a bit). It saddens me to say\\, i wish this movie didn't happen.","true":true}
