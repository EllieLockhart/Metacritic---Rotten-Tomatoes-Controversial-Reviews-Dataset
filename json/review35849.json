Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is shocking in almost every single way. It takes bold risks\\, makes crazy decisions\\, and just when you think things couldn\u2019t get any more epic\\, The Last Jedi will surprise you again. Rian Johnson\u2019s script is fantastic\\, matched only by his direction. His movie is unique and unpredictable. Any time you think you know where the story is going\\, he flips it on us. He\u2019s given the characters a major upgrade by exploring parts of their stories in ways that were missing from The Force Awakens\\, especially with Kylo Ren and Rey. However\\, Leia\u2019s role is also expanded and it ends up being a truly lovely tribute to the late Carrie Fisher. And Mark Hamill shines as Luke Skywalker. His performance in the movie is his best in the entire franchise. Overall\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great movie. It is a truly incredible experience with moments that made me cheer and applaud\\, and I will never forget these moments for days to come. Every character is worth caring about\\, and I never felt uninterested. The moment the credits started rolling\\, I immediately wanted to watch it again. I cannot wait to see what Rian Johnson has in store for audiences in the future of this beloved franchise.","true":true}
