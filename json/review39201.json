Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film brings a marked freshness to the Star Wars saga. The evolution of the character of Kylo Ren (portrayed masterfully by Adam Driver) is the true heart of the film\\, firmly marking it as the next chapter in the Skywalker Saga. Hamill and Fisher provide the strongest portrayal of their iconic characters\\, while Daisy Ridley starts to break free from some of the more wooden elements of her performance in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThis is something truly original in terms of plot\\, pacing\\, and character development. It takes the saga in bold new directions with brave choices\\, wonderful surprises\\, and shocking moments. It pushes the boundaries of Star Wars to its limit\\, while still remaining absolutely true to its roots in a galaxy far\\, far\\, away. \\n\\nI'd venture to say that its the strongest cinematic entry in the franchise to date. It's an absolute must-see and deserves multiple viewings.","true":true}
