Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a hardcore SW fan\\, so maybe I'm not invested as other are. However as a film lover\\, I found this itineration completely unnecessary\\, the story plays senseless with beloved character's legacies. I found myself dreading the last half hour just waiting for it to end. There is nothing wrong with innovation and expanding the story but coming up with random excuses to solve the problem seems like a quick fix. Adding those \\\"cute\\\" porgs is another example of the real interest in this film\\, which is selling as much as you can no matter if it destroys a beloved story.","true":true}
