Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fell asleep the 1st time I watched it\\, but thought I would give it another try  now that it is streamable; but I was very disappointed and would give it no more than 2 1\/2 stars.  And that is being generous if you ask me.  The attempt at humor and cuteness is way to forced\\, kind of wanted to stick my finger down my throat.  I think it would have been better if Chewbacca ate the bird\\, now that would have been funny.  I have never been a big fan of the  cutesiness\\, but I guess some of it is good for the young crowd (the very young crowd---the children).  The cutesiness\\, however\\, is just part of what is wrong with this flick\\, the storyline was kind of uninteresting.  \\n\\nThere did not seem to be much of a plot\\, seems like the whole was just to try a snuff out Luke\\, and why was he being such a thorn.  When he threw the light-saber I believe I uttered the phrase \\\"WTF\\\" out loud.  I did not see any humor in that at all.; and why was he so against the Force...he was a master\\, and certainly would not have feared it. Did Obi-wan fear the dark side?  No\\, he remained strong with the Force.   There was also way too much going on\\, why the big casino planet?  Well I guess it make sense that they were trying to fit in some of the weird alien types like they did in the Shady bar where Luke first met Han Solo. (or the Space-port that is) : \\\"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy\\\"....They could have used some decent lines like that to make it help make it more interesting......The Casino however\\, did not quite work...something was off about it; it didn't seem to fit.  \\n\\nWhen I first saw Kylo Ren take off his helmet in The Force Awakens\\, I thought \\\"What the Hell!\\\".  He seems to be such a whiney dweeb.  Certainly not an off-spring of someone like Harrison Ford and Carrier Fisher.  He does not even look remotely like either of them.  Talk about a gigantic monstrous shnozz\\,...I mean\\, what a pizza-face.  And now he is the Supreme Leader????  Oh boy\\, now we have that to look forward to.  He should have kept his helmet on\\, that would have been better.  And why would a powerful guy listen to the poor captured Rey\\, was he not interrogating her.. What a wimp.\\n\\nI do like Rey\\, but it would be nice to see more of a personality with her.  Maybe in the next film I suppose....but I definitely am not expecting much in the movie itself.  The Supreme leader is a pizza faced wimp with powers.  He is like a troubled adolescent who has not yet figured things out.","true":true}
