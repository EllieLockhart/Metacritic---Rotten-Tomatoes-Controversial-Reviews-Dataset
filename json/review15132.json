Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it as a die hard fan. But god. They dropped the ball. Big time.  Brutal. Luke and the titty scene. Leia and her stupid scene. Snoke gone and no backstory. Comedy was horrible. Finn and that Asian chick that somehow lucked out on an acting job was horrible. Forced shit kiss. Forced. All bs. Again. I'll watch cause this is my favorite franchise but I'm just beyond disappointed","true":true}
