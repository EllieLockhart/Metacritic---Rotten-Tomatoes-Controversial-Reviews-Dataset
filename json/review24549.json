Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie definitely had its flaws (Finn and Rose storyline)\\, but also had some amazing scenes and epic shots. The storyline\\, especially towards the end of the movie was very enjoyable. I see that the audience score is really low\\, but everyone I've talked to enjoyed it\\, and perhaps the people who hated it are just so passionate that they were more likely to leave reviews. Anyhow\\, a solid installment in the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
