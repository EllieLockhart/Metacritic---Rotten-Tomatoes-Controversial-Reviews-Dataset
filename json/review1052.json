Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another Star Wars film that did not disappoint. The amount of storytelling and vision that captured in this movie was impressive. A nice fast-paced exploration through some important plot points and character development. While the humor at times felt a little forced\\, it didn't distract from the overall quality and storytelling of the movie. I feel like the franchise is just starting to pick up steam and find its footing as it establishes itself again. The farther away we get from people comparing it to Episodes 4-6 the better.","true":true}
