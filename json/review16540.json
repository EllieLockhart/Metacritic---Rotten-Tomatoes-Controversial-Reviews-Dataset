Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a trilogy built on nostalgia\\, this movie draws in people due to the old characters\\, but due to the poorly integrated \\\"progressive\\\" themes and the old characters acting nothing like themselves... this movie hardly deserves the Star Wars name nor association with Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nIf this wasn't bad enough\\, characters like Finn get hardly as much development as they should and get cheated out of a hero's death\\, which would've at the very least made the movie have an impactful ending.\\n\\nThe only thing to say about this movie is it looks good\\, but... it's not that surprising considering the budget.","true":true}
