Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is powerful in every sense of the word. Its storytelling and portrayal of its characters is authentic\\, compelling\\, and relatable. It takes you on an incredibly emotional rollercoaster ride that always keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. The audience is rewarded with the answers to many questions posed by The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jedi presents new ones that remain to be addressed in the final installment of the trilogy. Episode VIII lives up to the extremely high expectations surrounding it\\, and though it is not what many moviegoers anticipated\\, the direction that it takes is unique and immensely satisfying.","true":true}
