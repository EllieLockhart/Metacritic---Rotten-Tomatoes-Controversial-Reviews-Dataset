Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The word copout comes to mind. Nothing from the Force Awakens matters\\, no characters are portrayed consistently\\, not does the writing bare any continuity with the original trilogy. Virtually every single action Luke takes in the film is the total antithesis of his original trilogy character. Snoke is a garbage character they had no ending in mind for. Rey's origin makes zero sense viewed next to the heavy plot indicators that she was a Skywalker (the family saber calling to her\\, pilot skills\\, engineering skills\\, not to mention instant\\, gifted-level connection to the Force\\, and dueling skills that allowed her to best an experienced duelist trained by two masters).\\n\\nI am glad Disney\/Lucasfilm were kind enough to make the movie so bad that I don't have to go see Episode 9. Because I no longer have faith in them and simply do not care.","true":true}
