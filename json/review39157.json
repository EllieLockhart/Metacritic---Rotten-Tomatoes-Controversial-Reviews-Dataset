Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode 8 is a pure disappointment.\\nExcept a very few scenes\\, this movie is a disaster. \\nEven the Yoda cameo is not enough to bring the movie to a better end.\\nWorst of all\\, it is a total disrespect to Mark Hamill. He deserved something way better.\\nIt felt like waiting most of the movie\\, hoping something interesting would come.....in vain.\\n\\nI've been waiting for this movie\\, and had a good feeling before going to the theater\\, but no\\, it's not a movie for the fans.\\nThe episode 7 smelled a bit of copy\/paste\\, but still was good.\\nRogue One was just great\\, a true good surprise.\\nI don't understand what happened here. I'm ok to see new ideas in the saga\\, but not this.\\n\\nMixing different directors on the same trilogy was a terrible idea. These guys have a different point of view\\, and you can definitely feel it\\nI'm scared about the last episode : recovering from this one will be too challenging.","true":true}
