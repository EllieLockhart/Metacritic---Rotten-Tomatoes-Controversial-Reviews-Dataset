{"101487":99878,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After reading so many of the audience reviews here on RT\\, it seems clear that there's a huge population of Star Wars fans that are blissfully\\, willingly brainwashed. This is no doubt why Force Awakens and Rogue One were so well-accepted; they were nearly blueprinted reproductions of the originals with very little risk taken and very little new ground covered. But\\, Star Wars fans like it that way. I am one Star Wars fan who doesn't.\\n\t\t\\nWatching Last Jedi is what watching the original trilogy in its own time would have been like - refreshing and different. The world of Star Wars got so much deeper and broader in the Last Jedi. In the original films\\, with few exceptions only the privileged inner-circle of heroes could hope to make any real impact; now we see that normal\\, everyday people can be heroes too. In 1977 the Force was new; with Last Jedi\\, the Force is made new again\\, as we discover that it truly belongs to everyone rather than exclusively to a group of what amounts to trust-fund brats. \\n\t\\nI do have some gripes about the film.  Firstly\\, why does anybody - at all - care about Finn? It's a shame that not even Rian Johnson could make the character interesting; certainly doesn't help that he is cringe-inducingly alley-ooped one of the movie's flattest\\, most uninspiring one-liners (and there is stiff competition\\, believe me). And secondly\\, I get exceedingly annoyed at the penchant minor characters seem to have for announcing obvious plot points. \\\"Oh. No. It would seem as if this obvious thing is happening\\, based on the obvious fact that the previous minor character announced out loud just now as well.\\\"\\n\t\\nLast Jedi accomplishes all of its trailblazing while retaining the core elements of the Star Wars universe\\, extending the story-lines from Force Awakens meaningfully\\, and injecting a desperately-missing sense of humor and unpredictability. Additionally\\, Rian Johnson gifts us with one of the most captivating characters in a science fiction film in recent memory - Benicio del Toro's DJ. The character of DJ is once again in the same jungle as Star Wars\\, but cuts its own way through the underbrush rather than boringly walking down the well-worn path. This is a good thing. \\n\t\t\\nAnd this is a good movie.","true":true}
