Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i love the star wars universe\\, but despised this film (and the last one).  i remember when i was a kid\\, we wore how many times we saw the original (episode 4) in the theaters like a badge of honor.  it was unlike any movie we had ever seen before.  it was mind blowing.  there is nothing mind blowing about this episode\\, or the one before it (7).  it is simply a rehashing of the major plot lines in 4\\, 5 and 6.  i know george lucas believes that in the theory that there are only 32 movie plots ever\\, but surely there is room to give us something more unique\\, more memorable.  disney has ruined star wars\\, but they are sure good repackaging the same story to milk us.  and one suspects they will sell a lot of porgs for the holidays.  star wars fans should demand more!  poor story\\, implausible events\\, bad acting\\, and the worst part of all for me: they absolutely butchered luke skywalker. star wars fans deserve better!  for the first time in 9 films\\, i do not intend to see episode 9 in theaters (tentatively titled\\, 'the return of the last jedi'?!). smh","true":true}
