Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"https:\/\/imgflip.com\/i\/21cf6e\\nTerrible Star Wars film that willfully wastes characters both by killing them off pointlessly and by giving them tasks that have no effect on the plot. So\\, disrespectful to J.J. Abrams. There are beautiful cinematic shots\\, but too many times there are irreverent gestures that call out that this will be a new thing and not your old star wars -- might as well get the Robot Chicken guys to write it at least then it would really be funny. The prequels look like genius compared to this. The film gets worse and worse the more you think about it.","true":true}
