Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was so excited for Luke to be back\\, and they ruined what could have been another epic part of the trilogy...Luke tried to kill his nephew in his sleep\\, and he is just going to sit back while his sister is under attack??!! The more I think about this movie the worse it becomes\\, I also think the critics were HORRIBLE in rating this...can\u2019t get an honest review anymore.","true":true}
