Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi did what I thought could never be done\\, it turned against Star Wars. Kathleen Kennedy can take this whole feminist\\, Mary Jane rubbish agenda and shove it where the sun don't shine. WTF is Disney doing? What they did with Luke Skywalker is just unbelievable\\, the new characters are a joke\\, Poe is made an impotent fly boy imbecile\\, Finn was goofy comic relief without being funny who was completely unnecessary to the plot\\, Rose was even more unnecessary other than checking another group represented in the name of diversity\\, then worse of all is Mary Rey Sue herself. She bests Luke f'ing Skywalker in a duel when by the timeline of the movies\\, two weeks earlier she thought this force stuff was just a legend. Remember in TESB when Luke struggled to call his lightsaber to him in order to save himself from the wamba? Rey literally and effortlessly moved a mountain to save the ridiculous and bungling friends when they followed crystal foxes to a dead end...again two weeks and no training after learning that the force was real. Too many other things to whine about. Horrible\\, horrible joke of a movie. Do not see","true":true}
