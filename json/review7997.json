Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Face it\\, seat wars has moved on and you should too\\, or you'll be like one of those weirdos who thanks that the stripper likes them. They don't care about you and they don't care about anything you've given them. All they care about is what they can get in the future and there's a new big spender in town - the teenage girl. The ethos behind this film is girls rule\\, boys drool.\\n\\nRose\\, Lea\\, vice Admiral Kathleen\\, err I mean Holding and Princess Rey have no moral failings\\, make no mistakes\\, and strive purposefully forward\\, saving the day. Compare that with Ben Solo (villain)\\, Finn (totally superfluous\\, meets Rose while deserting)\\, Po (tops off getting the bomber squad killed with some light insurrection) and Luke (always distant\\, both figuratively or literally). Add is some insincere diversity fornthe critics had the millennials and you have another finely tuned Disney mega blockbuster","true":true}
