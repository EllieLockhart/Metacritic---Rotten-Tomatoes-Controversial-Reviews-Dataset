Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game takes you through an emotional journey from the beginning. The death of Joel was the most heart wrenching part of the game (among a lot of other moments). The story is told from Ellie\u2019s and Abby\u2019s perspectives respectively and overall it was a great way unfold Abby\u2019s backstory\\, intentions and drive (which you for yourself can judge). No one in this game is a \u201cgood person\u201d everyone is heavily flawed. Naughty Dog did an excellent job with the running theme \u201cCycle of Revenge\u201d how far would you go for someone you love\/care about? Would you go as far as these characters (Ellie & Abby) did? (Hopefully not). The ending of the game closed that loop for Ellie & Abby at the end of it all they still lost those close to them and ended with nothing from of their decisions. We aren\u2019t forced in any way to sympathize with a specific character\\, none of the violent actions they commit are to be sympathized with\\, we simply go through the coaster and judge as we see. They want you to feel emotionally invested with the characters actions basically giving you a prompt to brutally attack another character making it so you start and finish the brutality. The back story given for Abby helps us understand her whether we agree with it or not. The world is disgusting\\, and violent as are most of the people inhabiting it. Thank you Naughty Dog for the experience\\, it\u2019s definitely a work of art\\, you wrote a story many people may not 100% understand. Within the first couple hours you\u2019ll decide if you like it or not and wether or not to continue playing or complain. At the end of the day it\u2019s an amazing game with great story telling and characters.Work of art.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
