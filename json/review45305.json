Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter disappointment. If this is the stage for a voice not for the weak choices made by the creators of this film then i have no problem coming here to voice my displeasure. Stunning visuals wont carry this movie and time will not be kind. For the first time ever im not excited about what happens next. Let Kylo burn it all down. Not impressed. What a missed opportunity to make something great. Im all for sonething new and different so long they had a proper send off for the lore and characters that made this a billion dollar franchise. We got different but its not good at all. Cringing at what might follow this.","true":true}
