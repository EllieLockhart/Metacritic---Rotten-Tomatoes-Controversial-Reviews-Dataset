Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So dissapointing. This film is like 1 big middle finger to all the old films. Choices in where the story went felt completely out of place for the characters. If your a fan of the old movies prepare to see why this is the lowest rated star wars movie of all time. Maybe the next one can salvage this trilogy.","true":true}
