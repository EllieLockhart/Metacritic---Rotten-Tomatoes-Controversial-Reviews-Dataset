Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The. Worst. Disappointment. Ever. 2 years of waiting and 40 years worth of storyline is supposed to be coming to a climax and the best Disney could come up with was terrible character development and bad CGI. I'm all for a new direction\\, but never has there been two more disjointed movies than TFA and TLJ. This movie made no sense\\, had no plot and was a complete bore.And who exactly was it for? Certainly not for the real fan base. Kids? It's a 2.5 hour bore\\, kids will not like this.","true":true}
