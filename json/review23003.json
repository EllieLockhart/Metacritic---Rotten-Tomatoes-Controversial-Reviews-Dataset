Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of plot holes\\, unlikable new characters because they don't have background\\, they killed the old interesting ones making them look ridiculous. What can I say\\, I think star wars was all about characters and nice story\\, now its all gone. 2 stars only for the visuals and sound","true":true}
