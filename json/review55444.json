Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie felt like 3 movies in one. It didn't flow well. Wasn't sure if Poe was supposed to be a villain or a a good guy. Was that character dynamic supposed to demonstrate an internal power struggle? Did that have to be in the movie? wth! Why did Leia have to slap him? What was that? Reverse those roles and everyone would be up in arms. This movie had some serious writing and directorial issues. Visually\\, as always\\, it's pretty bad-a$$. I was going to take my son to see it\\, but I'm going to wait for it to be released for stream or rental. Generally disappointed.","true":true}
