Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say about the most divisive Star Wars movie in history. Absolutely horrible. This movie ruined Luke Skywalker. The new characters were took in an awful direction. I hate Rose and Holdo. Everything TFA set up  was threw out the window. Thanks Rian Johnson.","true":true}
