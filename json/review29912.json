Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"R tomatoes refreshed while review was being written. Nasty. In essence star wars has numerous illogical motivations that undermine large portions of screen time for the sake of what I believe to be ideological possession and the proliferation of political propaganda. In the future\\, a better score will be granted to a better movie\\, which is to say\\, logically concise and fits in the current frame of the star wars universe.","true":true}
