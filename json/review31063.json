Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So it turns out some 85% of the bad reviews are from accounts made just to down vote this movie\\, which makes sense\\, star wars means so much to so many people and this isn't Lucas' star wars. Walking out I woulda given this movie a 3 because it's not what I wanted\\, but going back and seeing it again I've realised that this is the kind of movie star wars needed. Its well written and acted and explores themes the old Eu only started getting into in its last decade\\, but those were some of the best stories! Dont go expecting anything and be open to having a new sort of star wars expirience5 you'll walk out giddy and excited for west this movie means for the future of the greatest cinematic franchise in history.","true":true}
