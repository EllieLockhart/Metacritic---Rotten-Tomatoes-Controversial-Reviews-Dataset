Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slightly better than the lousy prequel; not worth the hype at all. Whomever wrote this movie needs to be shown the power of the dark side. After \\\"Rogue One\\,\\\" I thought maybe finally someone remembered how to write a good \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie; unfortunately\\, the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" gave a hunt that this was not so and \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" confirmed the sad fact that \\\"Rogue One\\\" was an anomaly.","true":true}
