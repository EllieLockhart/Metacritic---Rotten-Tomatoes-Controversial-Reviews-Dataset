Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm 47 and was around when Star Wars was released. I love the original trilogy. Nothing will ever come close but enjoyed Episode VIII. It wasn't fantastic but was as I expected. I enjoyed it more than Episode VII but not as much as Rogue One. I think the problem is movies are hyped up so much these days prior to release. Other than the first trailer I avoided pretty much everything including reviews and previews. I enjoyed it for what it was and am glad I saw it at the cinema.","true":true}
