Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand all the hate\\, but I also understand that with a franchise such as this \u2014 where fan theories make up a large part of the discourse \u2014 it\u2019s always going to be hard to put out the exact movie that everybody wanted to see. When TFA came out\\, the world had been devoid of any fresh Star Wars lore tied into the original trilogy\\, but now that the market is being more saturated\\, the films are going to have be of the highest quality. That all being said\\, this movie is certainly enjoyable and does give the hardcore fan base its kicks\\, but it also missed out on some opportunities to expand the canon\\, which obviously disappointed many people. If you\u2019re trying to decide if it\u2019s worth seeing\\, the answer is still yes. ","true":true}
