Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was Born in the year Star wars released\\, so I have followed the Star Wars Universe my entire life. However\\, The Last Jedi has me perplexed.I saw moments of genius in this movie\\, and then I saw total disarray as well. Luke Skywalker was completely mishandled based on his unprecedented reputation\\, There was a perfect moment when Carrie fisher (Leah Organa) could have been honored off without making it weird. And WHY was Snoke even created. Although i believe he was one of the Sith supporting wise men of the old republic. In all this is Star Wars and I will be a fan till the end.. But this segment has left way too many plot holes\\, .. alot of filler for upcoming money grabbers from Disney\\, and Didn't do enough to answer the questions needed to be answered. JJ Abrams has his work cut out for him on the third installment .. Please send it off in the right way... And dammit give Finn some force powers for crying out loud!","true":true}
