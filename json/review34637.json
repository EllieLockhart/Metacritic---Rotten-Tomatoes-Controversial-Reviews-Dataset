Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The characters were bland\\, some mary sue. The story is uninspired\\, copy of older plotlines (not to mention easily predictable). The pacing is slow. The worse of all is the illogical actions of the admiral when needlessly creating a rift between her and the subordinates. Her leadership resulted in an mutiny (death from fellow rebels)\\, one third of the movie wasted on a adventure by two characters which I did not care about\\, the introduction of the backstabing hacker who told the enemies of the plan anyways. And resulting in the loss of many resistance fighters in the escape pods. If this admiral just lead the fighters properly the movie could have been done in half the time!\\n\\nSeriously what was the point in the character Rose?","true":true}
