Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is an insult to the masterpiece that is the first game. The idea of Joel dying was something I figured would happen in the sequel since it is necessary to close his character arc imo. However\\, Naughtydog executed it very very poorly. The ending is very anticlimactic and makes no sense and straight up pisses on the first game. The brilliant people that worked on this game such as Troy Baker\\, Ashley Johnson and Laura Bailey did not deserve their characters to be treated this poorly. The gameplay\\, graphics and acting are even better than in the first game\\, but the story is written by an analphabetic sloth called Neil Druckman who should never be allowed to write another work of fiction ever again. Druckman should go straight back to writing academy together with Dave and Dan from Game of Thrones.\r\rTLDR: Gamplay 10\/10. Graphics 10\/10. Acting 10\/10. Writing -30\/10.\r\rPetition to glue Neil Druckman to a tree and leave him there? I'll start one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
