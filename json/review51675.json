Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A devastating sequel in this much anticipated trilogy. It was painful to watch. We kept looking at our phones waiting for it to be over. The plot and cringe worthy scenes made this film unwatchable. Who on earth approved this horrendous script? What wasted potential. Great actors with bad material\\, what a tragedy.","true":true}
