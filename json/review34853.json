Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The equivalent would be if Harry Potter were to come back\\, but he's a divorced alcholic that gave up magic and his friends. Ron is a criminal and killed. And Hermonie is trapped in a job she hates.\\n\\nWelcome back to Harry Potter! \\n\\nI don't see fans taking that too well.....\\nYoda and Obi-Wan were on the run from the Empire that was running shit. They were holding out for maybe Luke being their ace.\\n\\nThey didn't run away because of failure. They were working on their next chess move.\\n\\nThe Empire and The First Order look and act exactly the same\\, so they pretty much are in the movies.\\n\\nWhat was negated was after a long path Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia kinda found the right lives for themselves. Han and Leia fell in love\\, Luke found the man he wanted to be\\, the Empire was knocked down so that a new galactic goverment could rise.\\n\\nInt he next movie all those planets involved in that goverment were vaporized.\\n\\nThe First Empire is back in super power all the sudden.\\n\\nHan is no longer a general\\, but went back to crime and left his wife.\\n\\nLeia isn't the President of the galaxy like she should be\\, but has to go back to being a freedom fighting terrorist and sending people to die... again... fighting the same kind people she was in 1977.\\n\\nLuke ditches everything that he'd learned\\, made him confident\\, and all the power and wisdom gained in ROTJ that made his defiance of the Jedi pay off. He went from getting his ass kicked on a regular basis by no names to standing toe to toe with the galaxy's most powerful.\\n\\nNow he can get bested by Rey who has no training. Abandoned his friends and millions of people in need to go live by himself and give up\\, kinda betraying all the lessons the original Luke taught myself and others SO you don't end up in a life like that.\\n\\nSoooo... yeah... everything won in the original got wiped off the board so Disney could start from the 1977 starting point..... again... of Rebels vs. Empire. Killed everything that created the franchise in the first place because thinking about building on top of what's been created and then evolving from there actually take caring about world building or really giving a shit about the world you're using.\\n\\nIt was easier for them to just copy the original formula instead. That and to wipe out any legacy so that maybe it can stop being compared against it.\\n\\nWhich.. could have been done if they evolved the story instead of resetting and wiping out its history.\\n\\nOh yeah... Han and Leia's love gave birth to a mass murderer\\, soo... yaaaay.\\nI'd have to imagine if you like this\\, you just like different things and need different things.\\n\\nIf you don't find resets bad\\, then... you're different and that's fine. A reset like this really is creatively bankrupt to me.\\n\\nA reason I feel they kinda walked in and ravaged the legacy characters is to move them as toy\\, personalities and products people would still want. \\n\\nYou don't have to worry about people asking for more Tales of Luke Skywalker if you reveal his life was kinda trashed. \\n\\nThat frees up the franchise to produce new toys and personalities that are of an age range more favorable. \\n\\nThat and \\\"What the hell is Star Wars??\\\" I feel they're saying. \\\"Let's just reset back to the original movies people liked and just do that. But we gotta take the old products out of circulation\\, cuz we can see them age. Keep anything though that doesn't age like a human... like Chewie and the Falcon.\\\"\\n\\nThis and while finally you have minority characters they're specifically kept away from being involved with or being able to affect the plot.  They're kept away from anything legacy unless it's a laugh at their expense.","true":true}
