Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously the worst movie of 2017 and a disgrace to the SW saga.  Too many pointless scenes that add nothing\\, misplaced humor and mistreatment of major characters to fix this mess.\\n\\nAND just when you thought that there couldn't be a character more annoying than Jar Jar Binks\\, they give us ROSE...no\\, no and no.  This movie was just an attempt to shove PC\\, SJW\\, liberal agenda crap down our throats.  Have nothing against a diverse cast\\, but this reads just like a how-to checklist for making a movie inclusive.  Instead of telling us a story\\, they lectured us on capitalism\\, animal mistreatment. gender equality and class warfare.  No thanks.\\n\\nFinal note...someone who hasn't seen this movie yet asked me what it was about\\, I couldn't tell them.  The storyline is that weak.","true":true}
