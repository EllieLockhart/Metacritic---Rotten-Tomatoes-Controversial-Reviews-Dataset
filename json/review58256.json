Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautifully crafted mangling of the original trilogy that attempts to make everything people loved about the original trilogy 'actually' wrong. They've destroyed every iconic character in George Lucas's legacy with the exception of Darth Vader - the character I presume sells the most merchandise. \\nI could re-state every other gripe that other people have laid out in their reviews\\, but I'll summarize my thoughts in saying that every 'twist' and 'mystery' that's eluded to in The Force Awakes and The Last Jedi trailers amount to absolutely nothing - and instead of a resolve\\, they just kill off whatever they don't want to explain. \\nNow a personal gripe of mine; the writers of these new movies seem to keep insisting that the past Star Wars was 'wrong' and that this new generation of characters are 'right.' As if these two can't coexist within the same universe\\, and that in order for the series to move forward the past must be tarnished and destroyed. Overall\\, it seems like a complete lack of respect for the Star Wars universe\\, and the fans both old and new.\\nI understand that this is a step in a new direction for Star Wars\\, but with the disrespect of past characters\\, breaking the rules of the force\\, and utterly pointless subplots - New doesn't necessarily mean better.","true":true}
