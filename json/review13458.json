Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" I even begin to figure why this movie has such a low rating by viewers\\, I absolutely loved it. everything I expected it to be. maybe the naysayers should try and create something anywhere near as good as this amazing movie.
