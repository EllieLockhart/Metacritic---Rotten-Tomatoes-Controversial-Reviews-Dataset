Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a big starwars fan in the sense that the lore and story of episodes 1-6\\, and even #7\\, matter to you---I think you will be very disappointed with #8 \\\"the last jedi\\\".  But\\, if you are okay with lazy story telling\\, lots of unnecessary plot holes\\, out-of-place illogical humor\\, and basically forgetting everything regal and 'deep' about #'s 1-7....   Then\\, I guess maybe you'll be okay with trading out the soul of starwars in order to just stare at the pretty visuals and colorful explosions.  thats really all this movie had to offer... pretty scenery.  *sigh...  they really hurt the starwars franchise with this movie...","true":true}
