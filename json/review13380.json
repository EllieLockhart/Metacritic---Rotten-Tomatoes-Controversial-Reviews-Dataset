Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the film. Just like every Star Wars film\\, there were parts I did not enjoy. But overall the film is excellent. Don't listen to the haters. They spent 2 years building up a story in their heads at what they thought this movie would be- and got whiney and upset that it didn't meet what they had created in their mind. It is a gold Star Wars film. Better than any of the prequels (1-3). There are several scenes that are just incredible. It has the best fight scene in any Star Wars film. It's good. Go see it. Ignore the haters and decide for yourself.","true":true}
