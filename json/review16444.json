Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so sad\\, but the in a single word MEDIOCRE. Awesome visuals can save the poor writing\\, is pretty much a scooby doo movie with lightsaber... or like the Luke Skywalker said\\, laser swords...  frustrating. But if you aren't invested in the lore of the series\\, will be a good film for the kids or for people with poor critic capabilities.","true":true}
