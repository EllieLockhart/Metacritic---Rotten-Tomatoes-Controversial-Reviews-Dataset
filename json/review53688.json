Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From start to finish this film was a mess\\, from its poorly written characters\\, corny dialogue\\, to its inconsistent plot this movie was all of over the place. \\nFor starters it's like episode 7 never took place as the First Order now have control of most of the galaxy despite having Starkiller base being destroyed and losing lots troops and technologies. But now in episode 8 they have new cruisers like the dreadnought and Snoke's gigantic command ship\\, plus many advanced weapons and technologies like the lightspeed tracker. This just doesn't make any sense for starters as the First Order are only the  remnants of the empire and yet they seem twice as powerful as the galactic empire\\, how in the hell did the republic not know about what the First Order was doing. Another incredibly bad thing about this movie was how they portrayed Luke. Luke was suppose to be a character who saw good in one of the most evil characters (Darth Vader). Despite all of the evil deeds Vader did Luke still saw good in him\\, however with Kylo Ren Luke already presumes he is irredeemable and tries to murder Ren in his sleep\\, all because Ren has been talking with Snoke. The whole backstory of Rey is now confirmed to be garbage as we find out that her parents were just drunks and that she has had no jedi training what so ever\\, so how on earth can she be so powerful and good at everything. Finn and Rose have to be the most pointless characters in this movie. All they do is mess around on a casino planet\\, get caught on Snoke's ship and Rose ruins Finn's sacrifice to save the resistance by crashing into his speeder as he tries to blow up the First Order cannon\\, this would have been a great moment for Finn to sacrifice himself but Rose has to ruin the moment. \\n\\nOverall this movie feels like an insult to Star Wars fans who give a crap about the characters and the lore\\, this movie completely reverses that. From Luke Skywalker acting no longer like Luke Skywalker and Leia somehow surviving in space and flying like Superman\\, to the filmmakers having no clue how space works with the bombers dropping bombs from above onto the dreadnought like there is gravity in space. So I think I'm officially done with Disney's vision for Star Wars and I won't be seeing episode 9\\, which is a shame to say as I have always loved Star Wars.","true":true}
