Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never hated a movie so passionately in all my life. I almost left half way through. They took Star Wars\\, a thing I love deeply\\, and ripped out its heart and soul. The turned it into a mindless Marvel movie. I'm deeply deeply dissatisfied by this movie\\, and I'm unsure whether or not I will see the next installment.","true":true}
