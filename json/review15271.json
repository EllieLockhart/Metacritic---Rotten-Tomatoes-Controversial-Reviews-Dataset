Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like star wars a lot and don't mind this trilogy\\, in fact\\, I really like episode 7. This movie was very cheesy at times. However\\, for the most part\\, I did not mind that\\, because to me a Star Wars movie is a bit cheesy. It also did not seem like it fit well with how the first movie in this trilogy set up the series to go. There were weird decisions that were made that did not benefit the plot\\, as well as questions that fans were asking from the first one (episode 7) that were not answered. Hopefully this will be fixed when episode 9 comes out","true":true}
