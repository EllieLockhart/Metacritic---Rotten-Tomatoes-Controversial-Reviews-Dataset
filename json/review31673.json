Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry but it was pretty bad... The character of Luke is poorly used\\, Rey is a mari sue\\, Rose is an awful character that add nothing to the movie. Plus without explications the first order has infinite ressources and troops even after the destruction of starkiller base! What they did to luke is sad and awful\\, he would never act like that. The stupid marvel style jokes just don't fit in a star wars movie! This movie had soo much potential and it was all wasted! All the suspense and mystery created in the force awakens are destroyed here!","true":true}
