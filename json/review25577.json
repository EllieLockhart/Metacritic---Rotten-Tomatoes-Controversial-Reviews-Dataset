Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bot.  Not a fake review.  Not a fanboy.  Something is very wrong with the critics.  A payoff or just a fixation on trying to guess what the movie goers will like.  Some great shots and visuals but a trainwreck of a plot\\, dialogue\\, and development of characters.  Horrible","true":true}
