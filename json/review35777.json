Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi Is Fantastic. Though the first half has some pacing issues\\, the second and third act make up for it with heart wrenching emotion\\, mind blowing action scenes\\, and so much more. This is a unique Star Wars movie\\, and is now ranking as my third favorite. Please do yourself a favor\\, ignore the user reviews\\, and see this fucking movie.","true":true}
