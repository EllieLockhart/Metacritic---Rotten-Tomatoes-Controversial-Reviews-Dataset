Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this movie! I enjoyed it better than the force awakens. The jokes weren\u2019t as corny and it wasn\u2019t just a remix of the originals.","true":true}
