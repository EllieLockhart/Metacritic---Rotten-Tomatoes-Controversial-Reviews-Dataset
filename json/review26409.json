Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not without its flaws\\, TLJ improves on its predecessor and opens the saga to a bunch of new\\, interesting characters...and Rose. The twists\\, the action scenes and sometimes oddly placed\\, yet entertaining\\, humor is enough to make this movie one of the most enjoyable of the whole saga.","true":true}
