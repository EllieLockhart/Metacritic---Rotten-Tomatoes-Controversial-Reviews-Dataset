Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star for the excellent cinematography\\, half a star for the score. Everything else in this movie flittered between boring and annoying. It's quite obvious that those now responsible for the franchises direction and writing\\, have no real love for the universe and the elements which  made SW the most loved dynasty in cinematic history. Kathleen Kennedy has shown through both her hiring practices and publicly outlined priorities\\, that she has no connection with the fans that turned SW into a juggernaut.","true":true}
