Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So you'll notice that this film's getting a lot of hate right away\\, and that's fairly offputting at first until you realize what those negative reviews actually contain. The vast majority of 0.5-1 star reviews of this film are simple 1-sentence \\\"reviews\\\" which state that they didn't like one scene in the movie\\, that the movie sucked with nothing to back it up\\, or that it betrayed \\\"the lore.\\\"\\n\\nThe truth is\\, it's a good film. However\\, that's not to say there's nothing wrong with it. There are some very bizarre directorial issues\\, especially in the editing. Some scenes seem strung together with no discernible rhythm or purpose\\, especially near the beginning of the film after the first big setpiece scene right at the opening. Some moments seemed thoroughly fanboy-pandering (seriously\\, we get it. Blue milk was a thing. Stop it.) \\n\\nBut looking at the film in retrospect\\, *especially* from the perspective of somebody who -- despite having seen every film in the series several times -- is not a huge fan of Star Wars\\, it's a well made movie. If you disregard the hours you've poured into non-canonical \\\"extended universe\\\" booklets and leave your fanboyisms at the door\\, it's enjoyable\\, interesting\\, and in contrast with TFA\\, is fairly original. By no means would I say this is aping off of Empire (though some story beats do feel somewhat similar)\\, and some plot elements were actually refreshing and unexpected\\, primarily because -- according to behind the scenes knowledge -- they were written to be surprising. \\n\\nI'd give this film a strong recommendation. For those of you really into Star Wars who don't mind your preconceived notions of exactly what the movie is going to be being broken\\, it's definitely worth a watch.","true":true}
