Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's spit in the the face of the fan-base that makes up the bulk of the global audience shall we? Never-mind the last 40 years of mythology and universe building. The Last Jedi cannot and should not be regarded as cannon in anyway. To do so\\, one would then also have to accept the infamous \\\"Star Wars Holiday Special\\\" as a legitimate narrative to the Star Wars Universe as well. The efx were nice. I liked Carrie Fisher a lot. The end credits appeared to be spelled correctly.","true":true}
