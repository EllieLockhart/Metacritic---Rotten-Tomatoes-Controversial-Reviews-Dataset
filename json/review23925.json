Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Making money is the theme now. It was like a 80s hindi blockbuster\\, where the script is written on the sets and solutions are found to take a story ahead. Political correctness\\, SJW enters in the story and destroys what was good in the original trilogy. People were given role like a forced ad-placement in movies\\, rather than what the story demands. On second thought\\, no story. 1977\\,$11 million (~50 million in 2017 money) produced a masterpiece. Rae\\, is a Mary Sue - she is GOD\\, and knows how to do everything. Maybe she is a futuristic android with advanced programming. So many plotholes with no logic scenes and sub-plots. And what is with the humour? Everyone trying to do a Marvel. Disney\\, you have taken the heart out and stomped it. You have drained the soul and strangulated it. May the force not be with you.","true":true}
