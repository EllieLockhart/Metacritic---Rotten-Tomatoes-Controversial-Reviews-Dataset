Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi destroyed amazing story arcs that people have spent the last two years debating and 30 years dreaming out -Who is Snoke... doesn't matter -Who are Rey's parents.... doesn't matter -who are the knight of Ren... doesn't matter Who is captain phasma.... doesn't matter\\n\\nAnd most importantly will Master Jedi Luke Skywalker pick up a light saber and show us what it means to be a Jedi.... guess what it doesn't matter.\\n\\nAlso\\, Rey was never trained by Luke\\, Ben Solo is an awkward pussy and a terrible villain\\, Finn is a pointless character who somehow turns into a hero magically by having blood smeared on his helmet (some lameass Disney bullshit) why is there a \\\"resistance\\\" when the Rebel alliance clearly won the galactic civil war? Where are all the giant Mon Calamari cruisers and support frigates? Episodes 7 and 8 were directed and produced by people who don't have a true passion for Star Wars.","true":true}
