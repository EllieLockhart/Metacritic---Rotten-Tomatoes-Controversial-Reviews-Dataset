Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was a very poorly thought out and executed film. Walked away for the first time not excited for anymore Star Wars films. If Star Wars has made you depressed in recent films this movie will make you down right suicidal. Not much else to say. The magic ended long ago.","true":true}
