The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First of all\\, for a game to be a 10 on my scale it would have to be something earth shattering amazing that I would play for 100+ hours. I\u2019d say TLOU1 was very close. I\u2019d give it a 9.8. I\u2019d give TLOU2 a 9.3 to be specific. Second\\, if you rated this game anything under a 7 you are being ridiculously unfair and you didn\u2019t go into this experience with an open mind\\, or you didn\u2019t enjoy the first game\\, maybe it\u2019s just not your genre of choice\\, but if that were the case you would not have played the second.It\u2019s the same incredible gameplay from the first game\\, Naughty Dog didn\u2019t try to fix what wasn\u2019t broken. The story was a lot more ambitious than the first\\, with the story\/writing being the chief complaint. The first game had a very tight and focused plot. Whereas the first game felt like an interactive movie\\, part 2 felt like an interactive TV series. As for the story\\, it hit some lulls (TLOU1 never did) and I didn\u2019t particularly enjoy the flashbacks\\, but playing the two timelines was so compelling and suspenseful. The first day with Abby I was disappointed to even be playing with her and the first day was a bit boring. Day 2 and 3 with Abby was the highlight of the game though. At the end of the day\\, I play games to have fun. I judge them way differently from movies and books. I play video games specifically to have fun. If a game were truly anything under a 6\\, there\u2019s just no way I\u2019d have the patience to see through a subpar 20+ campaign to the end. If you played through this whole game and gave it a 5 or a 6\\, you\u2019re full of crap. If you have it under a 5\\, you\u2019re a troll that isn\u2019t to be taken seriously. It\u2019s very clear what happened to user reviews of this game. If a game has replay-ability its at least a 7. I will absolutely play TLOU II again\\, probably several times over the next 5-10 years. It was an extremely fun game\\, bottom line. I didn\u2019t want this game to end. But I will say the ending was a bit too dragged out. The part where you\u2019re tracking down Abby was an absolute blast though. So to wrap it up\\, no it\u2019s not perfect\\, no it\u2019s not good as the first but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be or demanding it to be. But I have to reiterate how damn good of a game it was and how much fun I had playing it. I feel not even the slightest bit of disappointment.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
