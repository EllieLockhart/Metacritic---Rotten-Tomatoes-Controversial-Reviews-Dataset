Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG\\, you really think this is a Star Wars movie?  This is a disgrace to the name.  It is so badly written I thought that Disney was pranking us and would jump out from behind a curtain two months after it came out and tell us they were just kidding. Thanks to this movie\\, I will never see another SWs movie again.  If Disney doesn't care enough about the franchise to let that movie be seen then it is only downhill from here.  Thanks for the memories George\\, that is all they are now.  ","true":true}
