Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This 48% is impossible. More like 25% at best. WHAT THE FUCK WAS DISNEY THINKING? You promised us this sh*t would be planned out in advance! Obviously it was so rushed they filmed this one without ever seeing the force awakens. Never again will I spend a penny on Disney Star Wars or products unless they fire Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson.  Also destroying the legend and character of Luke Skywalker is irredeemable unless they make this trash pile non canon in their Disney Star Wars verse. It's not my canon anyways only the George Lucas verse for me!","true":true}
