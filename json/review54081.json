Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I disliked most everything about this movie. The story is poor to say the least and littered with plot holes. The First Order reigns supreme with no discussion why even despite just losing Starkiller Base. It's leadership is nothing more than blundering buffoons and frankly the Resistance is about the same. Luke Skywalker was reduced to a moron and was easily beaten by Rey in a stupid stick battle. Got to see Yoda! Overall shame for the franchise.","true":true}
