Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At least JJ Abrams made Force Awakens for the fans despite criticism for being compared to A New Hope! The Last Jedi is taking our beloved Star Wars down a path that will Be hard to follow! Disney is foolish for thinking these new characters whom we have no emotional investment\\, will carry the future of the franchise! I was let down last night and no matter how hard I want to like it\\, I just can\u2019t. The Last Jedi had its moments that made your gut feel that tingly sensation of nostalgia \\, but overall it left me disappointed and with no anticipation for Episode 9...
