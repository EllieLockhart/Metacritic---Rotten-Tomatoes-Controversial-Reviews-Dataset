Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie twice. The first time I saw I thought it was decent but some of the plot points didn't make a lot of sense especially the side mission of Finn and Rose was practically useless and Poe's mutiny was pointless. If anything was good. I was invested in the sexual tension between Kylo and Rey.  The second time I saw and after reading up on other people's point of view problems became glaring.  The SJW and political nonsense of diversity was more like a slap to viewers faces. The SJW preaching was more important then telling a good story.","true":true}
