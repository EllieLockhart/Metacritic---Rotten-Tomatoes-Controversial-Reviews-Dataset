Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review is more a response to the negative reviews I've been seeing\\, so some spoilers ahead.  I've always been a diehard Star Wars fan\\, from consuming the now non-canon books about Jaina\\, Jaicen\\, and Anakin\\, to playing Armada in basements with other nerds.  The film has enough nods to the characters we loved as kids\\, and so what if most of them die off with a whimper\\, such as Admiral Ackbar?  Do we expect these characters to live on for a hundred years?  It gave us a whole new fleet of characters\\, and even the minor characters feel colossal\\, such as Benecio del Toro.  What made the original Star Wars so great was that even those figures that barely showed up on screen--IG 88\\, Greedo--felt like they could have universes built out for them\\, and they eventually did.  This feels that same way.  \\nI've seen people complain about a long run time\\, but I can't take those complaints seriously.  There's yet to be a Star Wars that ran less than two hours\\, and why would you want that?  The film is escapism at its finest.  By the second hour\\, when the film was reaching its climax and I thought it was ending\\, I was praying it wasn't.  And hey\\, someone answered my prayer\\, because then we got the visually and emotionally fulfilling final appearance from Luke.\\nAs for how he disappears\\, or dies\\, or whatever\\, I've seen so many people complain that they don't understand it.  To be honest\\, it made much more sense than Obi Wan vanishing mid duel with Vader.  Jedis vanish.  It's what they do best.  And it made the most sense for Luke to vanish-a hero who saw everything he fought for crumble\\, who spent decades trying to build back a lost order\\, only to realize he's in the same exact place he was when he began.  Let the man rest!  Or as Kylo said it best\\, let the past die.  \\nI think part of the backlash on user reviews has been because all our fan theories and gesticulations were proved moot.  And that can be a little upsetting for us\\, who like to pick everything apart and tie it back to some canon event.  If Snoke wasn't Darth Plagius\\, then he was a clone of Palpatine\\, or an evil Jar Jar\\, or a clone of Anakin\\, but all those theories are mired in the past.  Star Wars may have happened a Long\\, Long Time Ago\\, but Star Wars fans seem to be stuck even more in amber.  The Force Awakens was a lot of fun\\, and a great movie\\, but it was a carbon copy of the original trilogy.  Here\\, Johnson offers us a glimpse into a new universe\\, where old heroes die\\, because heroes have to die at some point\\, and villains die too\\, and so does Admiral Ackbar and so does Nien Nunb\\, and all the other side characters.  Make way for new rebels and rogues! \\nAnd lastly\\, Johnson gave me something I've waited twenty years for: I finally saw the red-robed Impetial\/Praetorian guards fight\\, and it was glorious.","true":true}
