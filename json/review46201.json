Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wanted to like this so much\\, but I can't get over how they portrayed Luke. Like TFA it puts a damper on the ending of ROTJ knowing what is to come. I didn't like the ship chase or casino planet plots\\, and some of the characters' actions were very questionable. The lack of a time jump also hurts the story I think.","true":true}
