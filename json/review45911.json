Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Via this movie\\, The Last Jedi's creative team eerily endeavours to distance the audience from the pre-established and beloved Star Wars universe. Disney's reasoning seems to be to steer a new generation down a new alternate\\, predefined path that cost them 5 billion dollars to dismantle and rebuild. SLIGHT SPOILER: Star Wars is no longer about the Skywalker family.\\n\\nPicking up where Disney's Tomorrowland stalled (and thus lacked the impact to mould a generation)\\, Star Wars is the perfect vehicle to get Disney's new word 'out there' to the next generation of 5 year olds (and above). That word is to all the chosen and gifted children out there: the secretive force\/universe can maybe be revealed in and to you if you are special enough and chosen... but this ship now feels like it is heading to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and not to a space opera galaxy far\\, far away.\\n\\nOkay\\, we all get that it's only a film\\, and Disney deals with children's films\\, but why did Disney pay all those billions to disregard the franchise and fanbase and make a story about new-age PC propaganda? Just make a new franchise! But I guess my reference to Tomorrowland arguably shows that they have tried. But Disney have obviously have hit partial gold due to audience figures enough to give the writer and director a future trilogy to play with. But what profit could they have made if they had catered to old and potential new fans?\\n\\nAs a continuation of a storyline (much of which Disney introduced in their previous instalment 'The Force Awakens') TLJ is a truly bizarre shocker which just ends up making a long-time fan like me equally both mad and sad. But as my opening paragraph refers to\\, I\\, and those established fans like me are not to be the focus of this new journey. The phrase 'The past must die\\, kill it if you have to' is referenced repeatedly in this installment. Okay Disney\\, I take the not-so-subtle hint... I am the past in clinging onto my childhood Star Wars\\, and I\\, and those like me have just been sacrificed for Disney's greater good.\\n\\nBut why did Disney just threw away all the fun and speculation they themselves had stoked and the fans had invested into the franchise? By bizarrely treating all established characters with distain or comic indifference and disregarding every plotline they set up in their previous film\\, Disney have seemingly taken their purchased fanbase down the same path as JJ Abram's LOST tv series. For the uninitiated LOST was a fantastic series which did exactly the same thing in abandoning or anti-climatically fizzling out their own plot-lines through lack of foresight\\, talent or more worryingly\\, care. Thus in doing so they both retroactively attempt to destroy the previous memories created. This is why it felt like a slap in the face to millions of fans. Disney is messing with our childhood and it's personal...\\n\\nIt could all be a ruse to throw us off the scent for future 'I am your Father' shockers\\, but at best this is a random set of scenes to give ammo to the future standalone and main movie arsenal. So IMHO 1 star this remains for some of the effects.\\n\\nI can only hope that Finn will wake up from his coma at the beginning of Episode 9 just like he did at the beginning of this film (Episode 8) having had a weird lucid dream. If the show DALLAS did it in the late 1980's (explain away a whole chapter as a bad dream) then Disney can...but will they? I think we all know the answer.","true":true}
