Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought only hardcore fans hated it\\, then I found myself hating it too.\\n\\nI guess the worst offence is how the entire \\\"fictional science\\\" of Star Wars is betrayed\\, especially in relation with space combat\\, with new elements that just don't make sense on top of being ridiculous and poorly written\\, that they make the original trilogy trivial\\, and the Death Star irrelevant. This is such a treason of the lore\\, such a huge mistake\\, it's inexcusable.\\n\\nPast that\\, the entire story is retarded\\, and it looks like the writers were just eager to get rid of the old\\, beloved\\, and well-written characters\\, just to introduce their own bland\\, forgettable Mary Sues\\, and achieve to kill it all with too much humor\\, that ridicules everything\\, even bad guys\\, to the point this Star Wars movie is the first to end without any respectable evil antagonist\\, nor expectations of a sequel.\\n\\nI can't imagine how terrible actual fans must be feeling.","true":true}
