Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It makes Episode 1 look like a masterpiece. This dull \\, bland movie will quite literally VIOLATE any older fans while spreading it's only message of \\\"Men are dumb... don't be a hero... ONLY WOMEN CAN SAVE THE DAY.\\\" This sexist Fem Nazi SJW film makes Jar Jar Binks an academy award winner! I can't make up how bad it is. From Luke milking a space something to Leia dying then FLYING THROUGH SPACE AS MARY POPPINS \/ jesus lady. Because that's the force. works. THEY EVEN RUINED YODA!! Dead Ghost Yoda burns down a tree with lightning. You are supposed to care about a bad 1920's casino while there is a 2+ hour long chase scene between the Order and the Rebels. What? How.....it's so dumb. They even ruin Finn and Poe! Men are bad! WOMEN ARE GOOD.  Luke is wasted and they show him as someone who wants to murder children in there sleep! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? There is no grand battle at the end\\, Luke astro projects himself (not part of the force) and some how dies because reasons. IT'S SO BAD.........THIS LITERALLY KILLED STAR WARS. But don't worry\\, everyone is special and a kid with a broom has the force. Because SJW'S!  If you like this film you are everything wrong with this world. THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM WITH BOUGHT REVIEWS!","true":true}
