Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leaving the theater last night I was left speechless\\, not because it was an awesome movie but rather because I felt like the movie fell short. All the build up from the previous movie led to nothing. I don't know what movie the critics saw but it was definitely not this one. Feel like critics today are being paid by big business (Disney) to rave about a movie\\, even if it sucks\\, so that the hype is enough to get people to the theaters\\, pay and make a mediocre film billions when it shouldn't. Critics should be ashamed of themselves for misleading people to believe a movie is great! Don't agree with me? The polarizing reviews between major critics and the average reviewer are a clear indication that I'm right. ","true":true}
