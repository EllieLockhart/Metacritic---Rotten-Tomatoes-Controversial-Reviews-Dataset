Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film ever made\\, even worse than the Phantom Menace. Snoke and Phasma were huge wastes\\, all of the story \\\"twists\\\" were disappointing and had no point\\, the Disney humor made the movie too cheesy\\, and the casino plot was just a huge waste of time.","true":true}
