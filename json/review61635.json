The first entry had me dealing with all emotions and I was all over the place at the end of the journey. When learned there was a sequal in the works back in 2016 I was both excited and worried that they would make a game not worthy the masterpiece they released back in 2013. The last of us part 2 brought forth the same excited\\, nerve-wrecking\\, anxiety\\, happy\\, sobbing feelings I had with the first one. Naughty Dog polished an already polished jewel and made yet another masterpiece with part 2. I was hooked from the start and throughout my 35+ hour playtime and my tears were running down my cheek when the credits rolled. There's a part of me that feel they could've given more screen time with Joel and Ellie to shine together before killing off Joel and also playing as Abby in the theater didn't resonate with me that much. But I get why they did it and what they're trying to tell us and I applaud Naughty Dog for having the confidence to make such a bold and beautiful sequal to a game that didn't need one. There's nothing out there that can compete with Naughty Dog both visually and in storytelling. Yes\\, I can see why this is a divisive game but it's a game still worth having played.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
