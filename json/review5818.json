Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed no spoilers here because there is nothing to spoil. Film was boring and is riding the coat tails of the past. The film ended exactly as I expected and there were not any so called twists because I saw them all coming wow! Truly felt like a B rehash. This is coming from a movie nerd ! ","true":true}
