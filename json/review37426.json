Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a lot of great moments in this movie and that\u2019s what barely keeps it afloat. There were a lot of really bad\/odd decisions made in this movie. Overall I liked it but I hope that they don\u2019t ever let Rian Johnson anywhere near this movie franchise ever again. He already did enough damage as it is\\, but hopefully not so much that it can\u2019t be saved. ","true":true}
