Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why did no one like this movie? I thought it was really good. OK\\, yes it had its issues like pointless detours\\, plot holes\\, & new uninteresting characters\\, but there was so much to love. It felt like a Star Wars movie but also did its own thing and even introduced new ideas regarding the force. It was a good film to add to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
