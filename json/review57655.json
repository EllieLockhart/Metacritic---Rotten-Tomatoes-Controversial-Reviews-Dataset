Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage. My star wars friends dragged me to see this (thinking about making them ex friends now) piece of rancor dung. Could barely sit through 20 minutes without feeling the SJ nonsense stab away at my sense of smell. I get it...White guys are corrupt\\, Women are naturally heroic\\, Patriarchy is bad\\, Matriarchy good\\, the Empire represents the Trump administration (which i hate btw\\, I'm not a fan of the alt right by any means) and so on and so on. It got to the point i was secretly hoping for a sudden onset of diarrhea just so i could have an excuse to go far\\, far away and never come back to see this horrible space detritus of ultra leftist space fantasy. The plot is standard SW post Disney: nonexistent. Not going to ruin it for you but let's just say it's no surprise there's a next installment coming. Disney has not just ruined Lucas' original masterpieces (and amazingly\\, surpassed the sequels in turns of stomach turning fare) but they've managed to ruin even a beloved icon like Luke Skywalker...that was probably the most unforgiveable stars. I don't just hate this movie I UTTERLY DESPISE IT..I consider it more painful than flaming hot pokers jammed into my eyes. If you're a typical dopey leftist feel free to enjoy this crap\\, if you're someone with some common sense who isn't  a SW fanboy nut\\, you will rightfully despise this movie and wish it send to the 9th circle of hell\\, where it rightfully belongs.","true":true}
