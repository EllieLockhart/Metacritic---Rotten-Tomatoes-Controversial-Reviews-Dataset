Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie ever made. A meddling CEO with a political agenda\\, an 'I'm such a talented artist I know better' Director with no clue about how to make a science fiction movie let alone a Star Wars. Yes they did open a door to space\\, pull Leia through it and then close the door again. This movie was doomed from the start and now the whole franchise as well as the hearts and minds of the legions of dedicated fans have been destroyed. I won't be spending another dollar on the Star Wars franchise until Rian and Kathleen are gone.","true":true}
