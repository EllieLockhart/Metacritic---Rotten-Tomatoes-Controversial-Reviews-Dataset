Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I woke up today from watching this film and my first words to my fiance were\\, \\\"I can't get out of bed. I am heartbroken\\\". What happened in that theater was a travesty and a slap in the face of everyone who loves Star Wars. An absolute disgrace of a film\\, with sloppy story telling\\, bad humor\\, plot holes the size of the grand canyon\\, and an ending that might as well have just faded to a picture of Mickey Mouse giving the audience a huge middle finger \\\"f*** you\\\". I have never came out of a film more disappointed than \\\"The Last Jedi\\\". I will never forgive Disney for that they did to Luke.","true":true}
