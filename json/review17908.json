Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has some good ideas\\, but ultimately there are just too many issues with this movie:\\n* None of the main cast has a character arc that makes sense\\n* There is too much stuff happening\\, and the movie feels both rushed and tedious\\n* Side plots are nonsensical and don't lead anywhere\\n* Subverts expectations\\, but every revelation falls flat","true":true}
