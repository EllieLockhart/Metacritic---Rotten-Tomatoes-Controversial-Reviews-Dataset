Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately\\, there was only about 10% of the film that kept me engaged while the other 90% wouldn't allow me to engage due to constant writing distractions.  Characters consistently contradict themselves based on actions within the same film much less the obvious contradictions from the main\\, original story thread.  One could go one forever about the problems with this film and is overly self-aware about the fact it's a Star Wars film.  What else can you say\\, it will probably go down alongside the most disappointing films in history; no matter how awkwardly the artistically prideless praise it.","true":true}
