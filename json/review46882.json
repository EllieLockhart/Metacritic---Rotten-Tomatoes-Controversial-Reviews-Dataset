Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We loved this next chapter. It was awesome and can't wait for all other Star Wars movies come out. It was definitely a jaw dropping movie. It will be a great movie to watch with family and friends during the holidays and thereafter. ","true":true}
