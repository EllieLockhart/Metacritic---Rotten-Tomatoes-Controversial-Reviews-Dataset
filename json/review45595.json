Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very disappointing. Plot was terrible in that it did not advance any of the storylines from TFA and it trashed Luke Skywalker's character. Nothing felt earned and perhaps the most shocking thing was how boring this movie was for a large portion of it. Are there some great moments and scenes? For sure\\, but moments do not make a story which was sorely lacking. I really wanted to like this but the more I think about it the worse it gets...similar to my experience with The Phantom Menace. First time I am not looking forward to the next instalment.","true":true}
