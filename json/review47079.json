Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible and lazy job of writing.  Seriously\\, the ships are fast enough to pull away from first order in a few minutes but over 18 hours they can't even get out of weapons range?  Flying across the galaxy and back in 18 hours at lightspeed? Flying through space and not dying without a suit?  Luke just dying? Snoke just dying? I bet they didn't know who he was either so they just killed him off.... geez.","true":true}
