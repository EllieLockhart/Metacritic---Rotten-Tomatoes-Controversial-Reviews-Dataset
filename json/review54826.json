Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie had the feeling of Star Wars while also doing something new. I thought the Rey and Luke interactions were great and showed a lot of emotions and the state the characters are in then showed how they got there. Would I have liked to see Luke face down the first order with a \u00e2laser sword\u00e2? absolutely but I\u00e2(TM)m happy with the direction Rian took as well. \\nDespite the split fandom on the movie in my personal opinion this movie has a lot to love and some stuff not to but I really enjoyed it and it\u00e2(TM)s still number 5 on my Star Wars list. A solid entry in the galaxy far far away....","true":true}
