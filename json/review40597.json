Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise.  There were so many gaps it was unbelievable.  The characters had no connection.  The story line was weak and boring at times.  Keep in mind I'm a big time Star Wars fan.  Sure\\, the effects were amazing but movie felt forced (no pun intended).  Don't believe me?  Just watch the first scene when Luke meets Rey.  I won't give it away but notice what he does with the lightsaber.  Why? why? why?  A true Jedi would never do that.  Horrible movie!!","true":true}
