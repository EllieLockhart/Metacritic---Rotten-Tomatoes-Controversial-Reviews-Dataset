Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I REALLY wish I liked this movie! I just don't ! Here's why - The director sent all the \\\"right\\\" Political messages so Critics will LOVE it\\, but sent the actual plot down a hole. That's why fans are giving such bad reviews. They erased all the old powerful sages and left only young punks with no training but somehow they are the most powerful ever! That way they can do whatever they want from now on and not have us complaining that it doesn't make any sense! It sucked. Look... Rey is a scavenger baby\\, Yoda is completely deranged now like - BOOM blow up the Jedi temple and giggle. What?!? Luke or \\\"Jake Skywalker\\\" as Mark Hamill calls his character because he is SO skittled out that it isn't Luke anymore. He strokes out at the end - LAME ! ALL the men were complete failures and the women heroes\\, fine\\, but who is Snoke? Why is Yoda Crazy now? And after the little pow wow with Luke and Yoda saying \\\"The Jedi must end\\\" Luke decides Yoda is wrong? and he's NOT the last Jedi... What? Failure. The movie is a failure.","true":true}
