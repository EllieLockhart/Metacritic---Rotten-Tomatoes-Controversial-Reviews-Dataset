Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like the plotline was written by a large committee with too many different visions. Despite beautiful production\\, scenes\\, etc.\\, it was long\\, tedious\\, rambling\\, with no climactic build-up  or proper story arc (just lots of sequental thrill-scenes). It was totally divorced from almost every previous Star Wars film and the lore in general\\, full of plotholes and inconsistencies that broke immersion and left you with a WTF look on your face half the time. Sooo many characters it wasn't even possible to identify who the actual protagonist or antagonist was. I didn't think it possible that the prequels could be made to look good\\, but in comparison to this ... well\\, their status as disappointment of the epoch is being challenged.","true":true}
