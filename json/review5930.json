Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing\\, lost the freshness\\, and nostalgia of the ep7. The characters are not developed\\, it is going nowhere\\, and all the mysteries to be solved are abruptly \\\"closed\\\". The 30 years expected return of the Jedi (of Luke) is giving us nothing\\, no real light saber fights (watch the fan films that some are doing !!!) Of course it is very well made and some sequence are very impressive\\, but it lacks a good story\\, good characters ... (I'm sure they will bring back Phasma again !!!). Maybe the next one whitout any of the old characters could be better ...","true":true}
