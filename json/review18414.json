Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is an awesome movie. You will think that you know what happen next\\, only to get your expectation thrown out of the window. The directing\\, the acting\\, characterization\\, scenery\\, everything is very very very good. Must watch\\, it's that good of a movie. It is comparable to The Empire Strikes Back? Yes it is!","true":true}
