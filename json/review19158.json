Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just awful. At each stage\\, the characters act in random ways that either go against their natural temperament\\, or break the laws of physics and\/or probability.\\n\\nFor example: they head off to Canto Bight to find the Codebreaker. They find him\\, but get arrested\\, and the mission ends in failure. But it doesn't\\, because there's another codebreaker (despite us being told that there isn't) and he's not only also on Canto Bight but by coincidence *is locked in the same cell as the protagonists*. At which point the audience realises that the whole escapade is just to get a Cantina-like sequence and an animal chase sequence into the movie. \\n\\nAnd don't get me started on what they do the Luke Skywalker. What did Mark Hamill do to deserve that?\\n\\nAll in all\\, a profoundly stupid\\, self-indulgent piece of filmmaking that urinates all over what Star Wars stands for and fully deserves its sub-50% RT audience rating.","true":true}
