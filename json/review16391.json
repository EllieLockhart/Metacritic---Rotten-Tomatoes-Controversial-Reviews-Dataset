Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really glad that Star Wars becoming way more darker than its previous movie. It is acceptable for a Star Wars film especially making the story more dynamic and unpredictable. So\\, probably Star Wars will become more successful started from this movie.","true":true}
