Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Epic scenes\\, but poorly written. For the hardcore Star Wars' Fan it\u00b4s a tolerably moderate movie. It breakes everything establish and does not serve justice to the legacy of the saga. Most of the most important things doesn't make sense and leaving me with a bittersweet feeling about it.","true":true}
