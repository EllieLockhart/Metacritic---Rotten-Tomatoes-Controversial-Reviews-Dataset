Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad movie that  had no real progression\\, it felt like a bunch of scenes that they just put in a blender. NO cohesion whatsoever\\, sure it was beautiful to look at\\, hence its 1 star rating. It was just a bad movie. I surely have no idea why it is certified fresh.","true":true}
