Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand why there are so many haters of this movie other than the fact that they ruined it for themselves by overhyping the movie before release. On its own\\, it's a very solid addition to the franchise with beautiful cinematography and an engaging plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat.","true":true}
