Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a serious Star Wars fan then this movie will cripple you with disappointment. My first response upon seeing it was \\\"star wars is dead\\\" and my friend said \\\"remember when you learned Santa wasn't real\\\" If Star Wars isn't an important franchise to you then you can enjoy it for its action\\, and a shocking amount of comedy. The comedy was really sad for true fans as it repeatedly undercuts character development.","true":true}
