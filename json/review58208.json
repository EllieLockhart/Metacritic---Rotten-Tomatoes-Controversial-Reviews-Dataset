Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero character development.  By the end of the 2nd installment of these movies\\, I still can't recall 5 main characters (original trilogy members excluded) by name.  There is no background story for any new character in these movies except for Adam Driver's character.  I don't care or identify with any of them.  The entire premise of the movie is essentially a car chase\\, where the faster car (rebel ship) might run out of gas and get caught by the bigger slower car (first Order ship).  And the bizarre side story with the casino felt like a different movie that didn't belong.  Lazy writing.","true":true}
