Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even taking the injustice done to the Star Wars franchise this was just a terrible movie. Right fro the terrible first scene of Finn staggering around\\, to the cringe worthy milking the alien\\, the even more cringe worthy \\\"put some clothes on\\\" comment\\, the lack of backstory to Snoke and indeed Lukes past. read the books and get a real Star wars experience\\, this is by far the worst movie I have seen for a long time and as a Star wars movie has failed in ways I cannot even begin to describe.
