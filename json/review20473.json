Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan ever since I have memory\\, it's one of the fictional universes that I've watched every movie\\, every show\\, read every comic of\\, I honestly can't imagine any kind of hardcore fans loving this movie. It has no plot\\, the characters feel like a mock out of themselves\\, it just makes no sense\\, what were they trying to do?\\nThe only good things were the music\\, still perfect as always. And the scenography. What an awful movie\\, first time in my life i've ever wanted to walk out of the movies. I'm so sad\\, if they wanted to do this kind of story why not take new characters in another part of the galaxy? they just had to come for our main story.","true":true}
