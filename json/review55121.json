Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was in there yesterday and unfortunately hve to say\\nFor a Star Wars Fan it is VERY bad!\\n\\nIt's a typical blockbuster good CGI well-known hero in mass but with lots of superfluous(Finn) and stupid storylines\\, no character development (Kylo Ren)\\, instead of love for detail or further development of the star wars universe there is a cuddly toy that Disney wants to sell(Porgs) and another stuffed animal to sell for Disney(Vulptices). And in an intensity your Eyes hurt. Then Lame jokes or conversations wich makes you think: For how stupid does Disney hold its audience? (Milenium Falcon conversation@Crait)\\n\\nTo round off the destruction of a part of the Star Wars myth: \\n\\nThe power it becomes so simplified that it hurts for someone who was really fan of the universe. A master? Training? Education? Just take a moment and you're Superman! Jedi according to this Movie: \\\"all arrogant and blinded Fools...\\\"\\n\\nAnyway\\, Rian Johnson showed me one thing:\\n\\nHe did not make a good movie\\, nor did he understand the story of 'Luke Starkiller' in the least.\\n\\n(Even though there are at least 160 books from the Extended Universe that could serve as a guide)","true":true}
