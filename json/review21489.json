Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would like to start this by saying that my political views lean to the left. I say this because one of the popular ways to dismiss bad reviews is by attaching them to a certain politic group that I don't belong to\\, so I wanted to avoid confussions.\\n\\nThis movie has cool moments and great visuals\\, but it also has unexplicable stupid moments and plot holes the size of Alderaan. It has Kylo Ren shirtless\\, for those who are into him\\, and Rey continues to be undefeated.\\n\\nBut the movie's main flaw is\\, in its core\\, what I call \\\"turntable feminism\\\". That would be \\\"well\\, for decades men have been in charge so now it's only fair if the tables turned!\\\" which is not the right way to right a wrong. And definitely not a way to make sustainable change in the society; not for the better\\, at least.\\n\\nMad Max: Fury Road has a female lead\\, and while some people complained about it\\, they were a minority (thanfully); Alita will have a really strong female lead and people are complaining about the eyes; Rogue One has a female lead and a pretty diverse cast and it didn't get the backlash TLJ got.\\n\\nThis movie goes out of its way to show us that every male in the movie is either incompetent\\, stupid\\, childish\\, coward\\, or downright evil; while (with the exception of Phasma) main female characters are always in the right\\, hold the higher moral ground and that the galaxy would be a better place if no male was in charge of anything. To do this\\, they sometimes make male characters make mistakes that are abysmally out of character. The biggest example: Luke.\\n\\nIf the only way they had to show women are \\\"strong\\\" is to make men \\\"weak\\\" they are not good writers\\, and it sends the wrong message the wrong way. It could (and is) allienate men\\, who are basically allies. Fury Road has strong\\, capable and interesting female and male characters\\, for example.\\n\\nAnd well\\, Rey continues without a real challenge. There's no real tension for episode 9 other than \\\"sexual tension\\\". We know already that she will win with ease\\, and that is not interesting at all.","true":true}
