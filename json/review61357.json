Realizing I wouldn't make it to them before they saw me I full on sprinted and killed them with a violent strike from my baseball bat. The noise caused a nearby patrol member to start shooting at me as i ducked behind the trunk of a nearby car.

Realizing I wouldn't make it to them before they saw me I full on sprinted and killed them with a violent strike from my baseball bat. The noise caused a nearby patrol member to start shooting at me as i ducked behind the trunk of a nearby car. The enemy then took cover at the front of the car whilst my partner joined me at the trunk. Now being as this car was next to a wall i couldn't flank them to take a shot. So being boxed in i decided i'm just gonna jump on top of the car and rush them\\, honestly wasn't sure it was gonna work. So i mount the car and run towards them then Ellie straight up flying kicks this dude in the face and while he's still reeling she crushes his skull with her bat.\rThis is honestly the best combat AI i have ever experienced in a game.  Every encounter is different depending on surroundings and  dynamics. It really shines.  I loved the first games story but i wasn't very impressed with the gameplay.  This gameplay feels fast\\, frantic\\, desperate and realistic in all the best ways. Straight up loving it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
