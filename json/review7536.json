Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone just shut up!!! This is a great movie. Yes it had problems with Luke's character\\, but I'm the end\\, he was the hero of the story\\, so just stop arguing about the questions it didn't answer\\, not everything is about what you want!","true":true}
