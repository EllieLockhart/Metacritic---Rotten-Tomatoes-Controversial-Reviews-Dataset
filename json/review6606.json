Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not be fooled. The movie is not a quarter as bad as many here will want you to believe. It is a movie that took risks\\, yes\\, but has so much good to it. ","true":true}
