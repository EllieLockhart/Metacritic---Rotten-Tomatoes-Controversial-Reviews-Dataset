Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie I've seen next to Force Awakens. So much is bad about both movies. But I'll stick to the later. First\\, It's obvious Rey doesn't need training. Why? Who the hell know. Guess we'll never know.  She can pretty much do anything Kylo can do and he spent years training with Luke. Half the movie she's begging to be trained yet she can do everything perfect already. Next Leia's superwomen seen was complete nonsense. It really just was weird. She has never shown any force powers before other then feeling connected to Luke yet she can fly in space. again weird.... Then there's Snoke who is he we'll never know because he's dead.  Yes the main bad guy dies in the  second of three movies. From a visual perspective the movie was amazing. But from a Star Wars fan perspective it sucked. Lastly is was really horrible that Luke\\, Leia and Han didn't get and scene time  together at all in the last two movies. It just seems like Disney just made these movies to quickly get rid of the old cast so they could move onto how they want to address future Star Wars movies. I mean everything that was great about previous Star Wars movies is being destroyed right down to Anikins light saber. And how Luke died was just lame that should have been saved for the 3rd movie. And he should have died fighting Kylo or Snoke maybe trying to save Rey or something. I wont be watching another SW movie.","true":true}
