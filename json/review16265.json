Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not even a Star Wars fan\\, but I've hated this film that much\\, that I wanted to review it. I mean\\, I've enjoyed the other movies but this one\\, what the hell? it was such a waste of time: sometimes confusing\\, sometimes boring\\, sometimes wanting to be \\\"funny\\\"\\, characters neither here nor there\\, we never got it. As for my Star Wars fan-friends\\, they didn't like it either. I do not understand why there are \\\"Excellent\\\" reviews at all. And why good reviews are just \\\"Good!\\\"\\, \\\"Brilliant!\\\"\\, \\\"Excellent!!\\\". Is Disney\\, buying some or ALL of them to balance the score? we'll never now. But believe me\\, this one sucked BIG TIME.","true":true}
