Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***NO SPOILERS: SPOILER FREE REVIEW THE LAST JEDI*** Let me start by saying the film was good. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I honestly enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, but when I left the theater I really wasn't satisfied. Well\\, just not as satisfied as I expected to be (maybe I expected too much?) Obviously my sentiments could change with another viewing\\, which I most certainly will be doing next week. Now\\, the previous entry in this new trilogy\\, The Force Awakens\\, was a much tighter and less convoluted film\\, although it did play it safe and by-the-numbers with the story-telling\\, it was more focused. The Last Jedi just felt like filler...it was good\\, but didn't do enough to embellish and flesh out certain characters (Snoke and Phasma for instance). Also\\, Luke's arc in this newest entry was interesting in the beginning\\, but as the film went on I was left wondering \\\"why did he leave a map in R2D2 to find him if he went to this island to be left alone?\\\" Again\\, maybe the third one will answer these questions. Hopefully! But Rian Johnson didn't quite leave the series with a \\\"spark\\\" that will start a fire for the third film. Hopefully J.J. Abrams can rekindle some of that magic from The Force Awakens and \\\"finish what he started.\\\"","true":true}
