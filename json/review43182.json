Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This should be called Star Wars: The SJW PC Version.\\n\\nReally disappointed with how they forced political and feminist agendas into the movie. And the humour felt really forced and Marvel-ish. Don't get me wrong\\, i love the Marvel movies but the that humour doesnt fit into Star Wars. Not once did I laugh in the whole movie (I probably laughed more times in the TPM).\\n\\nBig thanks to Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for making Star Wars into an avenue for your own selfish agendas. \\n\\nPS I like Daisy Ridley but Rey is a Mary Sue character with ZERO character development. Are there even any flawed female characters in TFA and TLJ??","true":true}
