Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. Nothing in it feels like it matters and it doesn't make me care about any of the new characters. Finn is the only character that could have been good and they wasted all potential with him. All the characters from the original trilogy don't fit up with how their characters should act whatsoever. Terrible movie.","true":true}
