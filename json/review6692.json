Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't fool yourself.\\nIt was just okay. Parts were good\\, parts were great\\, parts were meh\\, parts were BLEH. This wasn't a 91% film. On the same level as the Bourne Ultimatum\\, of Wonder Woman? Of the Fellowship of the Ring? Forget the argument \\\"It's a good movie\\, just not a good star wars movie.\\\" You know it wasn't as good as those other non-star-wars classics even though this scored the same level. Overrated\\, should have scored around 80% on rotten tomatoes\\, more or less.\\nDon't fool yourself.","true":true}
