Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with SW in the 70s\\, I love the OT\\, \\nand the Prequels gave me some awesome moments (though jar jar is unforgivable).\\n\\nWhen TFA came out I really enjoyed what they did and was willing to overlook\\nthe rehashing of OT story lines. So long as they went forward with a new story arc\\nin the next 2 movies.....\\n\\nAnd here we are\\, WTF happened?\\n\\nThis movie manages to ruin beloved OT characters\\, ruin TFA characters and \\npretty much give us a SJW movie that ruins SW forever!\\n\\nDisney does not understand the Lucas vision\\, this is all about money\\, even Mark Hamill\\nwas unhappy with what they did to Luke. \\n\\nWhat we got was so bad it even ruins the TFA!\\n\\nThat said\\, it was made for the SJW crowd and to appeal to Disney's fan base\\,\\nso I understand why some people will enjoy it.\\n\\nSo like or hate it\\, it exists and nothing will ever sadly change that.","true":true}
