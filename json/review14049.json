Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you love Star Wars\\, you're going to hate this movie. We've been betrayed by Disney and this director and they have ruined the storyline. If your kids know nothing about this series and they love fast moving flashing lights and you don't love them... then this should punch the ticket.","true":true}
