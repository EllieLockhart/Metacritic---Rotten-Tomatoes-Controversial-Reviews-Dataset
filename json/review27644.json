Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pacing was the absolute worst. Too much content in too little space like pretty much every big budget movie. Why not make two good movies out of it instead of one shitty one? I don't know. The movie was campy and dumb. Nostalgic but garbage. Better than episodes 1-3 for sure\\, but honestly\\, hardly worth seeing at home\\, and definitely not worth seeing in theaters.\\n\\nThe only scene that stood out was the artistic rendering of the hyperspace jump attack when captain whoever flew into that destroyer. That was great. Everything else was enormously superficial shite.","true":true}
