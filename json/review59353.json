Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"first of all\\, don't believe those horrible reviews that people are giving the game. The Last Of Us 2 is a game faithful to the mechanics presented in the first game\\, but improved. The game is incredibly beautiful\\, with ultra realistic graphics\\, especially on the faces of the characters. Now about the history line\\, I can say that it is very good if you understand that the game is about people\\, and that people make mistakes\\, especially when they are moved by emotion or traumatized \\, and that in this game there are no hero characters or villains\\, do not play this game thinking that you will control a fair and innocent character. I think the lack of this notion brought all these bad reviews. So considering that\\, I belive there are two big mistakes in the script: first of all\\, the way Abby finds Joel pretty quickly in the same day they found Jackson it's very convenient\\, it didn't cost anything to spend a little more time and make this part more realistic. second: the time spent on Abby with the kids\\, I feel like they were only put in the game to make Abby look like a good person\\, and it makes sense because the game wants us to feel empathy with her\\, but I don't think we needed that much time to do so\\, they could include more of her relationship with her friends\\, more about her time with the fireflies. Last of all\\, the way Tommy treats Ellie and Dina when he comes with a clue about Abby doesn't fit the character and Ellie threatening Lev at the end to\\, even tho she was desperate and traumatized\\, I don't think Ellie would do that\\, just look at her reaction when she finds out she killed a pregnant woman.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
