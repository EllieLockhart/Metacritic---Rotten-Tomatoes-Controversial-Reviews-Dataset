Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly loved this movie. I think that is was a very well good movie. The plot was very interesting. I know not very many people like but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone hated it. ","true":true}
