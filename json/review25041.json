Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My Star Wars review: Napoleon Dynamite makes a great villain.  I love preachy\\, condescending social justice themes in my sci fi (whether I agree with them or not).  You really don't have enough girl power in this movie - More cowbell!  Laura Dern's character is such a pivotal historical figure in the series and deserved such a large climatic role unlike Admiral Akbar who you rightfully unceremoniously killed off and literally gave his seat to someone no one cared about.  I love how you developed a new character - Rose but completely ignored any development of prior main characters.  I love how righteous and powerful every female character is in the movie and all male characters are impulsive and\/or bumbling broken idiots. More cowbell!\\n \/sarcasm","true":true}
