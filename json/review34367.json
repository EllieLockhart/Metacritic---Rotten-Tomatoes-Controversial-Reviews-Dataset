Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bad humor (can you hear me now?)\\, the disregard for plot elements from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, the mistreatment of long standing\\, fan favorite characters (Chewbacca\\, R2-D2\\, etc.)\\, the disregard for ESTABLISHED LORE\\, the plot elements used in the film\\, the focus for underlying political tones...\\n\\nI can't and won't rate this movie higher than I'd rate Phantom Menace- a movie which I USED TO consider the worst in the Star Wars universe. The worst movie in the Star Wars episodic universe now goes to \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"- something I thought could never happen starring Luke Skywalker\\, Chewbacca\\, Princess Leia\\, C3PO\\, and R2-D2.\\n\\nAside from production values and certain moments\\, the story just isn't good. Shame.","true":true}
