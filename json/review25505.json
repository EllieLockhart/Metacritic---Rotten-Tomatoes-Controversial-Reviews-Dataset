Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(No Spoilers) Glad to see a Star Wars movie take risks and push the envelope. The direction Rian Johnson took the film\\, left me constantly surprised and on the edge of my seat throughout the film. The journey of new character's as well as our legends is told well\\, the cinematography is beautiful and the film stays true to Star Wars while taking a bold new direction. Not only is this a good Star Was film\\, it's a good film in general. I won't dismiss that a few things fall flat\\, but in a 2.5 hour movie\\, that's bound to happen. I left the theater smiling and I can't wait for Episode 9.","true":true}
