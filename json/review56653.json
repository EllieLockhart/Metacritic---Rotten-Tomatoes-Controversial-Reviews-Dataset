Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi took the plots sown by The Force Awakens and poured gasoline over those seeds and lit a match. The result was a boring display of lost opportunities\\, particularly with Rey's family history\\, Snoke's coming-uppance\\, and why the Resistance fleet was in the middle of nowhere low on fuel in the first place. The script focuses entirely too much on what were as I can only imagine supposed to be funny quips\\, that were recieved as out of place and wasted diologue. The amount of cutesie lines and fauna come across as Disney being an over bearing try-hard. This does not feel like Star Wars at all. At times - think the entirety of the Casino sequences - it felt like a spinoff of The Hunger Games. Most other places it reminded me that if Disney ever wrote a drama series\\, that I would steer clear of that disaster. The only redeeming quality of The Last Jedi is the brilliantly executed light saber fight scene. I'd argue it's the best of all the films. Beyond that\\, this film was a very disappointing display. I wait anxiously for The Return of the Abrams.","true":true}
