Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have so many thoughts and emotions on why this movie is so bad. I want to keep this short though\\, so I will summarize them.\\n1. The entire movie is cramming \\\"politically correct\\\" agenda down your throat. \\n2. The characters have absolutely no emotional connection on screen or in the viewers mind.\\n3. This movie feels more like a spoof of Star Wars than the actual movie. The humor is awful and awkward. You can't take any of the roles seriously because they are making awkward jokes the entire time.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: it is really sad to see such an amazing franchise get trashed by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.","true":true}
