Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An OK film if you are new to the star wars world\\, and on its own it passes the time. Not strong narratively\\, but the effects were good. worth seeing if its on tv\\, but not worth paying for.","true":true}
