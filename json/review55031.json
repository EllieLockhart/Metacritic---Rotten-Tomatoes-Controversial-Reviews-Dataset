Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a star wars fan ever since empire hit the theaters and I was 5 years old and i have to say... I believe I enjoyed justice league more than this film. This was almost completely devoid of emotion and the characters\/plot were written very poorly. There were a few cool scenes and some really beautiful sets\/scenery\\, but not enough to salvage this. Star Wars is meant to be exciting and fantastical and uplift the audience. This\\, sadly\\, was the first to really not achieve that (well\\, episodes 1&2 might also be grouped in there). Missed opportunity here overall. ","true":true}
