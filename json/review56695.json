Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie destroys so many characters and who they are fundamentally. Luke would never do those things. Not to mention all the unanswered questions and bullshit dialog from untrustworthy characters. VERY DISSAPOINTED","true":true}
