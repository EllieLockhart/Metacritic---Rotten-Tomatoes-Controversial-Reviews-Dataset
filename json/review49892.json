Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can't please the fans!\\nThe reveal about Reys parents was destined to be criticised whichever way it went. I'm very happy they went the route they did\\,l.\\nThis film feels fresh and original\\, it plays with and breaks tropes. It's slow burning\\, covers a small period of time and really focuses on characters.\\nAdam Driver and Mark Hamill stand out as exceptional perfomers. Driver in paticular makes \\\"the bad guy\\\" human\\, relatable and beleivable.\\nMy favourite installment yet.","true":true}
