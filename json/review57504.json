Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This vast improvement over the last two installments in this storied franchise provides some much-needed relief to a series that was rapidly running out of gas and originality. With a well-crafted\\, insightful allegorical story line\\, fine performances by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher\\, excellent special effects and a restrained reliance on action sequences to carry the narrative\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" gives viewers much to ponder while serving up an entertaining saga more in line with the original films in the \\\"Star Wars\\\" mythology. Admittedly it's not perfect -- a little overlong (especially in the pacing in the first 45 minutes)\\, a little weak in its use of 3D effects and a tad too cutesy in its comic relief -- but these shortcomings don't significantly detract from the overall product. It's truly satisfying to see this franchise finally getting back on track.","true":true}
