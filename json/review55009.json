Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was painful having to sit through this movie simply wondering when it was going to end. As I was leaving\\, people in the parking lot were screaming \\\"thank you disney for making a star wars movie so bad that I'll have to cry myself to sleep tonight\\\". I couldn't agree more","true":true}
