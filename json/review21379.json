Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will watch it again and thought it was entertaining. I love all types of movies and enjoy them for what they are. Some people have already decided to hate it before even seeing it\\, while others are deliberately giving it a bad score whithout even watching it? Why I don't know? These so called fans build it up to much and get hooked on what they think\/want to happen and when it doesn't they hate it. It's a good movie I enjoyed it.","true":true}
