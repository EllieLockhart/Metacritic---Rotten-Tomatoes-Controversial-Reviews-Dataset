Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a total dumpster fire.  You know a good Star Wars movie when you want to watch it over and over.  You couldn't give me this POS...  I tried to overcome my disgust and watch this a second time\\, but couldn't even make it past the first 5 minutes.  I don't care about any of these characters\\, and I hate being slapped up side the head with SJW crap.","true":true}
