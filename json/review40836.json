Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie captivated and captured\\, indulging the nostalgic feelings that fans of the franchise like myself have for the series. The story characters and performances were subtle yet powerful enough to provide perspective. A morality tale deftly hidden in the heart of the film has got me wanting more from this New Hope!
