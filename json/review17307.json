Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie. I loved both The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, but The Last Jedi (more like the Last Jest) left me more disappointed and upset leaving the theater than any other movie. This film is a MESS that is full of plot holes\\, a poor script and colossal failures. It has too much forced humor and does a disservice to characters new and old. It does have some good moments but they are too few and far between the bad. How this film is being universally praised by critics is beyond my comprehension. This isn't a Star Wars film\\, it has no heart and I was left with an empty feeling of confusion afterwards.","true":true}
