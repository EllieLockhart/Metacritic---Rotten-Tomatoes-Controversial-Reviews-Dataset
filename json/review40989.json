Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie  doesn't have  a coherent story.  It is full of sight gags that harken back to Monty Python or Tim Burton films (or Tekken).  It in no way captures the feel of a Star Wars movie.  Yet\\, it still manages to copy many of the beats of Empire\\, making it also unoriginal.   It fails on every level.","true":true}
