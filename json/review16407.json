Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm shocked at the amount of negative reviews for The Last jedi. I thoroughly enjoyed it (as did my wife and 9 yo daughter). It's fun\\, exciting\\, emotional and contemporary while at the same time it's corny\\, hokey and respectful of the original trilogy. EVERY movie has some nits you can pick\\, and I do have a couple. But nothing I saw up the screen lessened my experience\\, or my opinion of the movie\\, the director\\, the studio and the saga itself. Just. Go. See. It.","true":true}
