Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it and I wish I hadn't. It had a very poor story according to me. What is truly amazing is the insanely high critic score. This doesn't make sense to me. I am aware that people are very split  as about 50% actually love it and 50% really hate it. Unfortunately\\, this star wars is not for me\\, I feel that the original characters were destroyed and the new story feels meaningless and full of plot holes. A very big shame :(","true":true}
