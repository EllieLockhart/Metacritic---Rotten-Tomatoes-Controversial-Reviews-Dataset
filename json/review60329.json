That word is accurate when you look at the scope\\, volume\\, and polish of this game\\, but unfortunately\\, that is not what I mean.\r\rThe narrative that this game is trying to sell is devilishly difficult to pull off. As you see by review bombing it's not one that everyone will get.\rFor me\\, it worked\\, and I'm astonished it did!\r\rI think that everyone who called this game a hot piece of garbage regards the story stayed closed for what that game has to offer.\rIt forces you to grow as a person and a player\\, you will resist and you won't like it.\rBut if you stay open it will change you.\r\rI never felt so many strong emotions playing a video game\\, part I did it as well\\, but there was light.\rPart II is not afraid to leave you in darkness\\, by doing so it is a much richer experience.\r\rSo should you play it?\rNo - If you liked part I\\, you think it was a perfect end to this story and want to leave this universe with a sense of accomplishment and closure.\r\rYes - if you are not afraid to be dragged through hell ride of fear\\, pain\\, excitement\\, and sadness.\rAND CAN STAY OPEN FOR THOSE EMOTIONS\r\rIt is worth it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
