Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did have some expectations going into the theatre\\, as this was advertised as \\\"Episode 8\\\" of the Star Wars series\\, but what I saw just didn't make sense or fit into the stories told in the preceeding 7 movies.\\nThis is just a bad piece of storytelling. It's a really flimsy plot.\\n\\nI don't think this movie is about feminist politics as the female leaders are all portrayed as incompentent. Leia isn't a very good leader (can't control Poe Dameron\\, for whom there are minimal consequences for disobeying orders\\, getting a load of his own people killed and enacting a mutiny)\\, Holdo appears to be an arrogant idiot who gets everyone killed while she doesn't tell anyone the weak survival plan and eventually figures out she could just hyperspace crash the ship. Just what is Disney saying to us here?\\n\\nRey is just automatically good at everything with no effort\\, doesn't need any Jedi training etc - what does this say\\, it's not necessary to work or sacrifice to achieve? This is a terrible portrayal of women.\\n\\nI don't particularly have a beef (specifically) with Luke becoming a murderous old man in later years\\, despite being a deeply self-sacrificing hero willing to lay down his life without hesitation in the OT\\, but we didn't get any back-story\\, or any indication at all\\, as to how he ended up so broken?\\n\\nNice visuals and music\\, but the story is just awful. Seems to be a movie about nothing and intent on destroying the Star Wars OT.","true":true}
