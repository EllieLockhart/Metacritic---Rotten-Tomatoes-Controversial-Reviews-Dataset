Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible entry into the series. Insulting to fans of the original trilogies. Just because it takes Star Wars to places we haven't seen before or does things differently than people expect\\, doesn't automatically make for a good film. Most if not all new characters in this movie were boring and one dimensional\\, any potential storylines of interest established in the TFA were all wasted in this travesty.","true":true}
