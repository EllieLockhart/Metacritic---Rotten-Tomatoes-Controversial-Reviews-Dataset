Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great movie! brought back the comedy elements in the original movies. great story line. great character development. great dialogue. great action screens. interesting twists to the star wars universe. loved it!","true":true}
