Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson dropped the ball on this one... While J.J did a good job setting up Rey with plenty of unanswered questions about her past and her \\\"beyond belief\\\" abilities to manipulate the Force despite being a complete rookie\\, Rian Johnson just failed to answer any of the questions the fans had. \\nThere's a reason why the Jedi believe training in the ways of the Force is absolutely necessary\\, a botched training would almost guarantee that the Padawan will fall to the dark side... Yet all we see is Rey doing even more unbelievably hard things\\, effortlessly. She is immuned to the rules of Star Wars\\, almost as if their need for a strong female character meant they had to bend the rules to her will (which makes her unrelatable and unrealistic). Bad character development is unforgivable.","true":true}
