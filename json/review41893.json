Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is trash\\, it's obvious that Rian Johnson and the Disney execs hate the original trilogy.  We are suppose to like characters as they do things that are horrible\\, Finn tried to leave the Resistance\\, like he left the First Order and is tased and detained.  I thought they believed in choice?  Apparently not.\\n\\nHow about we start the movie with a phone conversation joke\\, it's unfunny and unbelievable.  How about we have bombs that require gravity but we're in space\\, nah don't ask questions.\\n\\nWorse than Jar Jar ","true":true}
