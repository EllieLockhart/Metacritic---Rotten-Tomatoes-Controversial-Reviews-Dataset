Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful visuals and great actors cannot hide the lack of substance of this entry into the Star Wars Universe. A jarring second act\\, an absolute absence of character development\\, awkward jokes that you usually hear in Michael Bay's movies and a confused effort to try and bring new political themes into the lore\\, leave the moviegoer only with one last hope: that Episode IX will at least try to be a good movie. In the end\\, the movie does not have any consequence for the development of this franchise\\, for better or worse. The so-called \\\"bold choices\\\" are limited to gimmicky twists and try to deter from the fact that this is unfortunately a very boring movie in itself that leaves no excitement for what's to come.","true":true}
