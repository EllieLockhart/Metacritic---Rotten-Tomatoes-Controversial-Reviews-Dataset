Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a forced departure from the past. They made it about Rey for the sake of it. Her character has less depth than young AnatSkywalker. I loved episode VII. I loved Rogue one.\\n\\n\\nThis movie has the most plot holes and anticlimactic endings to themes of the 8 core films. This was made to purely to be spectacle and paid little service to the rich worlds created before it.\\nF*ck you Kathleen Kennedy and F*ck you Rian Johnson.  I'll take Jar Jar over this steaming pile. Shock and Awe doth not replace substance.","true":true}
