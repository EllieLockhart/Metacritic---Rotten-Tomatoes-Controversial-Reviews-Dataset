It recaps your latest chapters much like a mini-series on a TV show and the style of which the characters interact and do things does this very well. It also has a butterfly effect that affects the story and characters in a surprising amount of ways (although it should have been a bit more dynamic and complex in my opinion). The use of quick-time events and not moving your controller adds much tension and pressure that makes an exceptional experience.\r\rThe only downsides are some characters receive more play time then others and are not explored equally. Also\\, the playthrough runs (while initially good to do a another run to collect everything you missed) can only last so long and yield the same reactions and decisions that do not dynamically change each run\\, which is a real shame. The story takes the role of a typical B or C movie script that deflates its logic after the halfway point and much of the character development and relationship bars are almost meaningless in their purpose.  Regardless\\, Until Dawn is a horror game that mixes a show\/movie style that works and is a great experience to play when going in blind.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
