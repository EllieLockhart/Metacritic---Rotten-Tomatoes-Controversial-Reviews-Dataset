Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Severely disappointed with this film. Was all hyped up and ready to watch something good but it left me lost and confused.\\n\\nSo many times I felt frustrated with the plot. It's never good when you ask yourself\\, \\\"Why didn't they just do that in the first place?\\\"\\,  or\\, \\\"Why don't they all just attack?\\\". \\n\\nSo much of it felt like plot lines from previous Star Wars films\\, rehashed into a new version at different points.\\n\\nFelt like a computer had looked at successful plot lines in previous films and then sewn them together - it lacked soul\\, ingenuity\\, character. The script left good actors with not much to work with.\\n\\nReally disappointed.","true":true}
