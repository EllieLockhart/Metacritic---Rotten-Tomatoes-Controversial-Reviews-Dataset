Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly my favorite star wars movie so far. It has some of the best action scenes in the entire series backed up with a very solid story. I honestly don't understand why this movie has so much hate thrown at it.","true":true}
