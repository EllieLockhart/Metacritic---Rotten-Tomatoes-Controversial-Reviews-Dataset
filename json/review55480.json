Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie review: Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\\nWell\\, with a nice touch of a cinematographic powerhouse before ending the year\\, it could be expected that the new part of the next trilogy will carry out the success its predecessor did in restoring the franchise.\\nAnd lo and behold\\, this film is more powerful than we could possibly imagine. And it continues to show how a diversity of teams from Disney can bring something so good to life with movies like this.\\nPros: Excellent action scenes\\, superb acting\\, interesting new cast from the likes of Rose\\, Holdo and DJ\\, well-executed thematic of the legacy of the Jedi\\, well-paced\\, good humor\\, superb visuals and special effects\\, an ending full of great potential and interesting twist of usual expectations from the audience.\\nCons: Not enough screentime for some of the new characters\\, some scenes dragged for a bit.\\nVerdict: 9.5\/10\\nThe force is going strong with Disney. Let's hope the Han Solo film and Episode XI will continue the success.","true":true}
