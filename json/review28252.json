Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, with plots you could fly a Star Destroyer through\\, no character development\\, and silly plots that pad the run time but add nothing to the story. Things happen because...plot. Things happen because the writer\/director needed them to happen\\, such a Leia Poppins\\, the wasting of Laura Dern\\, Captain Phasma getting the Boba Fett treatment\\, and the gutting of Luke Skywalker to shine a light on the greatness of Rey\\,the reigning Mary Sue. One had to wonder if the sequel will be called Return of the Mary Sues.","true":true}
