{"101487":194663,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, this whole mess of a movie has exposed that Disney pays off film critics and that Rotten Tomatoes is complicit by turning a blind eye from this scandal\\, along with keeping the audience score at an artificial high score. It does not take a Mathematician to calculate that the audience score should be tops in the 30% area\\, but more likely in the 20% basement. \\n     The only reason that the film grosses over $1 billion is that any new Star Wars film has a built-in audience\\, but look further and the box office figures show that the fans hated this film. So far TLJ has grossed over $771 million LESS worldwide and $331 million LESS domestic (U.S.) than TFA. If this film was even decent\\, it should have had similar numbers than TFA\\, but since it is awful\\, the figures are disappointing.\\n     Disney's strategy was obviously to shove down PC and pro-women rubbage down the viewers' throats.  They were to first have Han dominate in the first of the new trilogy then hit the dirt\\, then Luke would take the stage in Round 2 before bowing out\\, and then Leia would finish off the trilogy and bite the dust in the third film.\\n  Well\\, cocaine and heroin got in the way of Fisher returning to the next film. I don't know why Leia was given more exposure than Luke and Han\\, considering that in the original three classics\\, those two dominated the films.  Fisher is a marginal actress to begin with.  At this stage in her career\\, she is a mediocre amateur.\\n    Everything to do with Leia in the new trilogy has been dull as common sense\\, science and any semblance of logic has obliterated.  She should have been the first character to go.\\n     To put a mediocre director\/writer like Johnson to handle a Star Wars film is beyond ludicrous. At most he is a vanilla TV director. What was Disney thinking? \\n     Why are white guys all bad and the girls the \\\"heroes\\\" of the story? Disney is a  joke how they drag the PC garbage out there while mostly MEN run the entertainment division and the company is a corporate raider\\, gobbling up products and companies left and right.  TLJ makes commercialism and corporations evil\\, while Johnson's salary on the film is more than every employee's yearly working earnings in Disneyland combined!  Disney treats its employees awful with near slave wages\\, while the corporate big shots make $10 to $50 million\\, along with multi-million stock options each year.  Kathleen Kennedy and the no-talent Rian Johnson will be laughing all the way to Fort Knox with their earnings.\\n     Disney is trying to make Rey the next Disney princess by having her become the strongest Jedi of all time with no training!\\n     Why is Disney messing with Star Wars by adding boring characters and discarding memorable ones? If it is to sell more toys\\, how is that possible when Star Wars ARE THE BIGGEST SELLING TOY SERIES IN HISTORY!!!!!\\n     To get the Star War fans back into the theaters for the third film\\, they must bring back Luke and Han.  That can't be done - or can it? They suspended so much logic in this past film with Rey becoming the super Jedi and Leia floating in out space\\, that to bring back the two fan favorites is possible.  They can explain everything away.\\n   This film made no sense.  Mark Hamill was right in his observation of how his character is raped in this film.  Of course\\, the Disney head honchos grabbed hold of him and he had to back track on his comments.\\n  Give Hamill credit for giving the best performance in this film in a role that was terrible.  Luke Skywalker is the hero of heroes.  He would never have buried himself like a hermit on the island while the galaxy goes to hell.  He was a fearless warrior\\, but in TLJ\\, they wanted to make Rey the hero\\, while Luke takes a back seat. \\n     The whole movie was a joke.  How many resistance members are left - around 12? \\n  Disney tried to insult the intelligence of Star Wars fans.  Sure they fooled some and bought the critics\\, but as said before\\, the box office figures don't lie.  \\n  Bring back Han! Bring back Luke! More C3PO\\, R2D2 and more Chewie and maybe the trilogy can be saved. If not\\, then the next film will be a resounding flop.\\n   Are you geniuses at Disney hearing us out the galaxy?","true":true}
