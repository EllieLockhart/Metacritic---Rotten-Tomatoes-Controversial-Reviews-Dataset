Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"******spoilers***** If you are TRULY a fan\\, don't expect much. There were a couple quick sequences that could have been worthwhile\\, but each falls short just as something is about to happen. Rian Johnson failed to make any meaningful connections to characters and plotlines were predictable. Almost no character development and character's storylines\/backgrounds (snoke\\, rey\\, etc.) are left untouched. The humor in this film is hard to watch\\, as it comes of forced and out of place. Kylo Ren fails to commit to the dark side and is left looking like a pushover. Rey is given convenient power ups with 0 training and is now supposed to be some Jedi wizard. Mark hamill made the best of the subpar script he was given\\, but still couldn't fix the movie. Enough said . . . I just honestly have no clue how this received 93% for critic reviews.","true":true}
