Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly thought I was actually watching a sequel to \\\"Space Balls\\\". The goofy characters\\, the ridiculous uniforms (what's up with the jumbo pens replacing the rank\/ribbons?)\\, the bad acting\\, the horrible plot...a truely horrendious film. If only Disney had gone with the Expanded Univers timeline\\, that has lots of great plots and characters (esp. the Thrawn series). We can only hope Disney hasn't forever ruined the franchise. Maybe they are already gearing up for a \\\"reboot\\\" since they have lowered our expectations so much with the last 2 pieces of dreck.","true":true}
