Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While recent Star Wars films such as the prequel trilogy and The Force Awakens have taken the approach of shoving as much plot into the running time as possible\\, The Last Jedi takes a hard turn and focuses more on the characters\\, philosophy\\, and emotion that made the original trilogy so amazing. Walking out of the theater\\, I felt renewed appreciation for the franchise after a series of mediocre outings and spent a good week thinking about what I had just seen\\, and that's what I want out of a film. I want to be asked questions without being spoon fed the answers by the time the credits begin\\, and The Last Jedi does just that. It didn't just entertain me. It challenged me.","true":true}
