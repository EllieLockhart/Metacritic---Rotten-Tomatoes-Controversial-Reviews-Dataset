Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, I was ridiculously excited to see The Last Jedi. I prepped. I watched all of the previous movies (even the prequels) in order leading up to this film. I was in the first available 3D showing in my area on the 14th. It was all worth it.\\n\\nSure\\, I experienced moments of disappointment and confusion during the flick. Particularly in reference to the answers I craved most from The Force Awakens. The story was a complete surprise compared to TFA. It had nothing that I expected. In short\\, it was the movie I didn't even know I wanted. \\n\\nIt wasn't perfect. I didn't walk out of the theater talking excitedly with my friend about how great it was.I had to wrap my head around it. Once I did that\\, I realized that this flick actually made me like TFA less. It took Star Wars back to its roots and I loved it. I really can't wait to see what happens next.","true":true}
