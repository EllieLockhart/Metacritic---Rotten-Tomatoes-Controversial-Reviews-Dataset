Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to let this movie digest.  It's a lot to think about.  There is so much to dissect.  And when I did?  I loved it. This film has LAYERS.  I'm not surprised some people don't get it but the volume of backlash seems excessive.","true":true}
