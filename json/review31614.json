Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much wasted potential. Luke Skywalker was so out of character. Weak villain. Pacing was awful. Inconsistencies with its own prequel The Force Awakens. I love the Star Wars universe and the word disappointed is an understatement. I really wanted to love this movie. It doesn't feel like a Star Wars film\\, only in name alone.","true":true}
