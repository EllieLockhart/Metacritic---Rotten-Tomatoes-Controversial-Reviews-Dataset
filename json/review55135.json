Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was shocked when I found out how many good reviews this movie had received. I've read plenty\\, and still fail to get their point.\\nSure\\, the director did show courage and made up for most of J. J. Abrams' mistakes. You really can't blame Johnson for winking at SW fans (although he did wink at children)\\, and in spite of many ideas taken from Episode V and VI or other SW movies\\, I must admit that Episode VIII is indeed an original\\, mostly new movie (whereas The Force Awakens wasn't\\, in my opinion).\\nStill\\, the whole film's filled with... plain nonsense. Silly x-wings demolishing star destroyers cannons\\, bombs falling in outer space\\, Leia surviving explosions and flying through outer space (worst moment in the whole saga)\\, people becoming stronger than jedi masters without training and so much more. I realise that consistency is not what Star Wars is made of\\, and I wouldn't be indignated for a few ridicolous scenes\\, but there are so many it's impossible to withstand them.\\nI also hated the continuous bad jokes and puns\\, the almighty rolling robot (he is cute\\, but gosh\\, he basically saves the day every other scene) and the low level humour which differs from the light hearted one of the other SW movies.\\nI wasn't convinced by Luke's transformation either\\, and was disappointed at Snoke being a simple placeholder (that's mostly on Ep VII though).\\nI didn't get why nobody in the high ranks of the Resistance could come up with an explanation of how they had been tracked by the First Order\\, while Rose and Finn figured it out in a few seconds. Nor it was clear to me while Holdo didn't simply explain her plan to Dameron\\, at least AFTER his mutiny (I call nonsense).\\nThe whole casino scene was boring and it didn't feel very Star Wars-y to me\\, and surely was too long. It felt unnecessary\\, as did Del Toro's character whose name I can't remember.","true":true}
