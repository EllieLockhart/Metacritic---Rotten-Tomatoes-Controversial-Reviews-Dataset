Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined so much of Star Wars for me.  They injected so much progressive agenda into this movie for no reason other than to be progressive.  I don't want to give away any spoilers but there's a lot her that just makes no sense.  The writing was just poor... I almost want to say that the injected some Harry Potter like teen fantasy into it.","true":true}
