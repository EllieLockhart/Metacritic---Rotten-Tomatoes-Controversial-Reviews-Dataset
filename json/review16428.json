Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve lost all faith in Kennedy\u2019s leadership of this franchise. Rian should be ashamed. This movie is the worst... it\u2019s worse than the prequels if that were even possible. So what kilo is the main antagonist now...a kid that isn\u2019t even that good in the force. No arc for Rey. Just an absolute travesty. I feel terrible for all those performers... Rian mucked everything up. My prediction is Rian loses his job and will not write the upcoming trilogy. No way. He\u2019s ruined this trilogy and that will become apparent soon enough. ","true":true}
