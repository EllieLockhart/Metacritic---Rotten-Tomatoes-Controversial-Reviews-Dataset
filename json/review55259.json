Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"La pel\u00edcula hizo que tuviera sentimientos encontrados\\, algunas escenas son realmente impactantes\\, pero hay otras que son aburridas\\, absurdas e innecesarias. Considero que hay aspectos que no son propios de una pel\u00edcula de Star Wars\\, lo que hicieron con el personaje de Luke Skywalker me parece una burla\\, parece que el Director Rian Johnson se paso por el arco del triunfo mucho de la cultura Star Wars... Primer pel\u00edcula de StarWars que termino por decepcionarme.","true":false}
