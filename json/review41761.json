Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is painfully OK. Not terrible. Not great. There is no arc to the movie\\, and the entire story is bloated. \\n\\nThe writing desperately needed an editor - clunky dialogue and about 30-45 minutes too long. The entire master code breaker plot is a waste of time. And the rest of the movie is about running out of gas. \\n\\nRose is a wasted\\, poorly acted character & her romance with Finn was forced.\\n\\nEvery time the movie almost made an interesting or bold turn\\, they backed off -\u00a0any character growth\\, Rey's battle with the dark side\\, Rey's parents\\, Kylo's struggle\\, etc.\\n\\nThere were some awesome sequences thanks to CGI\\, but hopefully E9 is written better.","true":true}
