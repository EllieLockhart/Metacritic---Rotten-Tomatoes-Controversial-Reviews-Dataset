Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It felt like there was a \\\"twist\\\" every 20 minutes\\, which eventually told me not to believe or care about what was happening.","true":true}
