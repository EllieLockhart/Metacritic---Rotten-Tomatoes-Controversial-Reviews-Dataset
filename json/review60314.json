And honestly it's very reasonable that so many people are disliking the story.\rBut after analyzing the game a lot\\, playing it for a second time and watching a lot of reactions by different streamers online\\, I do think the game and the story do deliver it just that the direction that took is not what many of us wanted.\rBut I can not call it bad. In my opinion it is really good\\, and I think it's worth playing and having the experience for yourself\\, it's dark\\, it's vengeful and immersive. However\\, it is harsh when it comes around the last game and if you do love the last game (just like I do) there is a big possibility you don't like the story.\rBut I still believe it's worth playing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
