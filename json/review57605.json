Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive movie\\, but one that will leave many Star Wars fans disappointed. Controversial treatment of certain beloved central characters and a distinct lack of universe-building and lore expansion left me...unfulfilled as I left the theater.  Established characters had disappointing development\\, new characters were largely useless. However\\, the movie definitely has its breathtaking cinematic moments and some brilliant acting sprinkled throughout. Overall\\, based on a single viewing - I am just frustrated and sad at the lost potential of this movie.","true":true}
