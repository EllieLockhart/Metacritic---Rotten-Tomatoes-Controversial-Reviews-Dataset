Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Critics Consensus: Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\"\\n\\nA Load of Bull\\, this is an awful film which completely destroys the legacy left by Fisher and Star wars. It does nothing to honor it and is a complete waste of time. I don't know what planet the critics are on but this was has probably killed Star wars.","true":true}
