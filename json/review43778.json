Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I thought it to be extremely cheesy. I can tell it was produced by Disney.  This movie is not as serious as the ones in the past\\, and actually has a lot of stupid cheesy jokes\\, almost like watching guardians of the galaxy. yeah\\, that stupid. When can movies be professionally made\\, instead of showing mostly action and \\\"nice quality\\\" films. It's too bad I will never look at Star Wars the same. If only George Lucas would have directed the film. Star Wars has dumbed down big time.","true":true}
