Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite receiving one of the best scores by the critics\\, The Last Jedi is a mostly disappointment film. It is very simple to find why when we analyze every aspect of it\\, remarking how critics are used to consume simple and individual stories instead of explore at least the main contents of this transmedia universe in TV Shows\\, videogames and literature. They are movie critics but they have a cultural responsibility\\, and Star Wars is not just a movie series it is a life experience and audiences are used to experience great deep and action packed stories. At this point of the universe we all know how powerful is the force\\, so why to take this item a major role if it will not say anything new. There is nothing we have already see in Rebels or Clone Wars\\, even in the Prequels\\, so in this aspect the movie looks a little bit weary. In its intend to be fresh the movie falls in a bored role about trying to retell what is the force and what it could do. The plot structure is very simple exploring three character arcs that converge at the end\\, much more entertaining but when you try to find an outcome target you realize nobody wins and the movie tries to destroys every single aspect you love from star wars. The chosen one prophecy\\, the Jedi legacy\\, the galaxy united to destroy an outrage evil\\, but the main problem relapse in not fulfill the audiences expectations. The task was simple\\, reunite every single aspect of star wars and make it great (Revenge of the Sith\\, Rogue One) give a little but solid pieces of the puzzle and grow up this new story about Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, the resistance and the first order\\, but instead of that\\, The Last Jedi give us a cheap entertainment far away form those contents showing by Lucas in the past decade\\, although they got many problems at their time\\, those stories opened the door to a massive universe and at this point I really appreciated the way the prequels took risking everything in place of get stuck in an esthetic limited by the budget of a time where a dream could be impossible to film by using the origina trilogy as main reference resource.We must remember that when Lucas got money he could show us the real universe that we all love. It could be great to see a battle over coruscant transferred to a space battle with the resistance and the first order or an Anakin vs Obi-Wan or Yoda vs Sidious lightsaber battle; Disney could do It\\, they must not be afraid of so why then they try to sell us the same. The same shot formula of lay aside\\, cultural\\, social and political impacts that make a war a war. The movies have become in the less important medium of contents\\, a marketing approach that is giving us good looking characters but poor stories or even action scenes. In this last aspect I wonder to know if director Rian Johnson watched al least every single movie and Clone Wars and Rebels episode before doing the film because there are many technique resources Star Wars do not use beginning with slow motion shots and silence during the battle sequences to \\\"make the moment more epic\\\". Star Wars triumphed because their film and photography resources were so organic and give the story such a naturalism hard to create by its time\\, Star wars never needed cheap movie tricks to make a scene great. Now I  understand why trailers where too short and too many\\, and it was not because there were big secrets around the movie\\, it was because the movie give us nothing great. Nevertheless there are good in terms of film creation\\, it got very valuable things like the introduction of the porgs\\, Rose Tico\\, the evolution of Kylo Ren and a well done appearance of an old friend. We must been very careful with what comes next\\, Star Wars is dying and even though The last Jedi is not a bad \\\"MOVIE\\\"\\, it is too short compare to what it could be.","true":true}
