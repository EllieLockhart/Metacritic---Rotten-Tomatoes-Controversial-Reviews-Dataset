Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! This was such a perfect Star Wars movie in every way! I felt like I was 5 years old again watching \u201cA New Hope\u201d for the first time at a drive-in theater. I probably won\u2019t stop smiling for quite some time. Thank you\\, Rian Johnson!","true":true}
