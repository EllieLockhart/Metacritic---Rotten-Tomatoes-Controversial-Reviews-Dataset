Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't care who did this film. It's just bad.\\n\\nBland characters\\, and humor that is just not funny by any standard. \\n\\nIgnorance of the heritage of the previous films and concepts that were introduced.\\n\\nYou may argue that Star Wars is silly from the get go\\, with starships that make noises\\, a so-called force that clearly doesn't exist\\, and blasters that shoot rays of light which are visibly slower than the speed of light.\\n\\nHowever\\, all previous films have kept these premises up the way they are\\, while this film ignores or changes them\\, as if that never happened.\\n\\nPrevious films may have had flaws\\, but were entertaining and at least had a gripping story which was in itself not contradictory\\, to a degree that is insulting to the audience.\\n\\nI'm not even a die-hard fan with models and costumes\\, but I always was positive about Star Wars\\, Luke Skywalker\\, Chewie and Solo\\, including the well written probably most famous villain of all time: Darth Vader.\\n\\nThis film killed the greatest franchise of movie history single-handedly.","true":true}
