Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, poorly conceived and poorly executed. This movie WAS my most anticipated movie of 2017\\, but this movie dashes any hopes quickly. Not only did Rian basically not follow on from JJ. Abrams on Rey's parentage but they left Snoke as a throwaway. Now onto their outright criminal portrayal of Luke Skywalker\\, not only did they perform a character assassination on him but they kill him off in the most unsatisfactory way imaginable. It literally spits on the original trilogy and the 30 years of expanded universe material.\\n\\nTL:DR Rey is a Mary Sue\\, characters were served no justice\\, Rian cant write to save his life.","true":true}
