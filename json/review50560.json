Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2nd time i tried to leave my review. another remake reimaged story that does not live up to originals. rogue one had some charm and was saved from mediocrity by a robot with soul and a great ending. force awakens lived off the star wars nostalgia and created some great visual moments eventhough it paled to what came before here we have a reinventing the wheel movie with copy and paste from empire and return of the jedi setting up great moments that become anti climaxes making aboring episode that leaves you cringing at every characters stupid line. it left me not wanting to see another star wars film as there was no story left to pursue as the new characters are 2d\\, forgettable and dull. an underwhelming story one of the most disappointing sequals ever made. i had no idea this was going to be this bad had no preconceived story in my head before seeing it i just went in on preview night with an open mind and got an awful robot chicken episode directed by lena dunham. its like the director is a star trek fan and hes trolling star wars fans by nuking lore strange choice.he is aware their are people that put down for religion on forms as jedi. still no jedi vs sith lightsabre and mind battles just a stupid fight with cannon fodder red guard. weak.","true":true}
