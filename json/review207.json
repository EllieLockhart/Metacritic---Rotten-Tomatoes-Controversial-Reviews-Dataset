You\u00b4ll listen to this stuff in the Karaoke bar and the Maharaja (disco)\\, very catchy songs which fits pretty well the 80\u00b4s style\\, some of them being parodies of that age hit songs.\r\rThe Bad:\r\r- Progression system: The game requires a huge amount of grinding from minigames (real state\\, cabaret club) in order to get the money to buy skills. There is a gap when most people decide not to learn more skills and finish the game with just half of them.\r\r- Combat system could be better: It\u00b4s not solid and doesn\u00b4t encourage you to learn all the basics of the combat system\\, for example\\, you can beat most parts of Majima easily just with the Breaker style because it\u00b4s so broken.\r\rLove the game\\, it\u00b4s one of those that you will remember for the rest of your life\\, you will love the characters.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
