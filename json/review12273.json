Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not Star Wars fanatic but I can appreciate good science fiction movie. This is not one of those. I liked Looper but the director (he's a writer as well) had just one mission here - to kill old Star Wars to make way for new generation. But maybe he did it too well and he killed the whole franchise in the process. The script is ridiculous including the slowest chase in the history of science fiction\\, actors are good but they have nothing to work on. Leia Poppins!!! But if I were a star wars fan I would be especially pissed at what they did to Luke Skywalker! Lie he is another character\\, not related to Luke from original trilogy.","true":true}
