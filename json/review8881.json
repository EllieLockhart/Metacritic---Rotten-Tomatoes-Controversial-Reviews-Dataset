Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the past 40 years people have had Luke as a hero to them. I may not have been around for the whole 40 but did look up yo luke. For a movie supposed to be about hope it ended up destroying the hope Luke brought in the other movies telling fans they wre wrong to believe in Luke.  that he was a broken man wanting to die not waiting for the right time to return like obi or yodq","true":true}
