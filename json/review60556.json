We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Look I played the game 3 times already \\, and here is a quick review of the game in my opinion. 1) story is actually good if you actually understand the point of it. Slightly weaker narrative than the first game 2) Main Characters are excellent. Loved Ellie and Abby\\, the side characters are mainly plot devices especially Abby\u2019s friends. Wished could\u2019ve learned more about Dina and Jessie they were interesting characters 3) Gameplay is amazing very responsive and smooth.  when you play as Abby\\, she is basically Joel\\, she can bust up skulls with her  bare hands just like joel. Ellie\u2019s gameplay is also well designed. Going stealth as Ellie is the super fun\\, using the bow with explosive arrows is so satisfying 4) Graphics is AMAZING.5) Lastly Joel\u2019s death\\, yes it\u2019s sad \\, I\u2019ve seen many people\u2019s reaction to this and majority said that he doesn\u2019t deserve this death and should have a hero\u2019s death. Look man Joel\u2019s no hero\\, the man did bad things to get what he wants and he literally is a selfish man he literally prevented a cure from happening just so he get a second chance to have a daughter. The reason why we love him so much is because he\u2019s so real \\, we learned his side of the story and he is a father figure to Ellie. That\u2019s why we adore him so much. But saying he deserves a hero\u2019s death is dumb. Overall love the game so much 9\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
