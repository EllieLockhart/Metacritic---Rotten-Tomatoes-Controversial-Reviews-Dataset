Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was just... so so BAD! I mean talk about ruinnung character Arcs and taking away all tat is fun and lovabal about star wars. Luke's arc was a mess and I just wated to scream at the screen the moment he threw away the light sabel. An wat was up With Rey just beeing like perfcet\\, but in a bad way. I don't like People who are just Perfect and do everything right. I mean show me some flaws man. By fare the worst Star Wars move. (worse than Solo even)","true":true}
