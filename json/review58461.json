Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the promise and expectation that JJ Abrams had set up with the Force Awakens was just brushed off the table and into the trash. So many new characters that were actually interesting were disposed of in the first two acts.  I left the theater bummed out.","true":true}
