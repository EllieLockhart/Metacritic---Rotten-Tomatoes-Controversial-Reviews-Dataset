Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One the best Star Wars movies! Hence the high score in Tomatometer. Do not pay attention to the low audience score. Most of them are probably First Order followers who do not want you to see what the Light Side of the Force can do ;)","true":true}
