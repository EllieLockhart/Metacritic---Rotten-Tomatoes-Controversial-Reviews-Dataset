Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw on a plane.  Enough to make me want to use the barf bag.  They made Luka a loser and then killed him.  Probably some kind of allegory for the race\/gender obsessed dorks running Lucasfilm now.  Awful characters - e.g.. Admiral Purple Hair.  And the scene with Chewbacca and the roasted bird was taken right from the Chick-fil-A commercial where the cow makes a looks at the person eating a hamburger. Unoriginal\\, disrespectful of the\\, with an overkill of the Hollywood political orthodoxy.","true":true}
