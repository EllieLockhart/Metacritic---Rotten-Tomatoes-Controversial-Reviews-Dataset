Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pior material do universo Star Wars. Roteiro ruim\\, ignora completamente os acontecimentos de O Despertar da For\u00e7a ( que ao contrario desse\\, foi um excelente filme) \\, sem contar a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o (da imagem) de um dos personagens mais importantes desse universo\\, Luke Skywalker. Enfim\\, prefiro assistir um stand alone do Jar Jar Binks do que ver novamente The last Jedi.","true":false}
