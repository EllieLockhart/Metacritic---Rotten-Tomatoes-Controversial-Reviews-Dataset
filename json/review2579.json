Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome film - easily top two in the SW saga after Empire. Really digs into some philosophy around the Jedi that The Clone Wars and prequels dealt with. Who is right in war? Which is the right side\\, and who is profiting? When is the right time to step aside or step into the fray?\\n\\nAlso\\, some of the best fight and light saber battles in the saga.\\n\\nIgnore the breathless ranting of angry boys who drag their identity politics into the fandom\\, stinking everything up. And I thought tauntauns smelled bad. \ud83e\udd23","true":true}
