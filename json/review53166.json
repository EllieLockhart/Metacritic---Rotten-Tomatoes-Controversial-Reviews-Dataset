Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad writing. Bad execution. This is nothing short of a complete disaster. Not to mention it took forever to not even tell a story. We are left knowing less of the characters we knew nothing about  and the story leaves off exactly where it began. \\n\\nThis movie was a complete confirmation of my initial fears of Disney buying the franchise. They have no plan for it outside of killing it's previous owners work\\, and it shows in the writing which seems to be made up as it goes. \\n\\nRian has once again made another completely mediocre movie. If he's the new voice of star wars\\, count me out.","true":true}
