Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The timeless themes of the original trilogy have been discarded and after two pretty good Star Wars movies \\\"Rouge One\\\" and \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" I had high hopes but this show is overlong\\, silly garbage with too many lame attempts at humor\\, not Jar Jar bad but bad. An almost total disregard for the character development of the original trilogy and a whole new set of rules for the force. Space flying is evidently now a force power. It was as bad as the wacky powers they started giving the Christopher Reave Superman that he never used before or after it was convenient for the plot. Disney also seems to not see the irony in an anti-consumption anti-cap shoehorned subplot from the largest entertainment company on Earth.","true":true}
