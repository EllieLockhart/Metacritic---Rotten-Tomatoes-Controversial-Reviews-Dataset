Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i didn't even finish watching it because so much of the dialogue and characters feel forced and unnatural. I rolled my eyes when I saw a purple haired lady taking control of a ship and start scolding the lame and moronic male pilot. Her only purpose is clearly being a SJW metaphor that men are reckless and stupid and sexist towards a woman's leadership and that she was some type of strong leader. A *strong* leader figures out what they have to work with and pushes and inspires other people\\, scolding someone like they're a child for something that can't be changed now\\, while in a desperate situation\\, isn't a good show of leadership. Don't get me started on how Luke Skywalker is treated. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!","true":true}
