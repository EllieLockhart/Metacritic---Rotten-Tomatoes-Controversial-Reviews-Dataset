Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I put this one in the bottom 3 or 4 of the 9 movie series.  I felt the middle 3rd of the movie was almost boring\\, the fact that one character said she loved another character before she died bit hardly knew the character was overplayed.  Mark Hamil was disappointing as an actor as he over acted\\, the incredible writing for his character was wonderful.   It was the writing and story made his conclusion meaningful and memorable.","true":true}
