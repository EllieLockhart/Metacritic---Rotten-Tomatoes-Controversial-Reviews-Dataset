Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a very typical 2nd part of 3 in a movie franchise. Transitional\\, like a game of chess it moves the pieces it needs to where it needs them to be ready for the endgame and sacrifices those no longer required. It lacks a really spectacular scene\\, an epic duel or something. And I found myself almost cursing at the screen in frustration as a scene in the ending almost appeared to clearly rip off Independence Day yet manage to end in a terrible\\, predictable Deus Ex Machina. That said it has to be noted that Mark Hamill puts in a marvellous performance as an aging Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
