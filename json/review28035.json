Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"plot holes never to be answered\\, too long for its own good\\, filled with forced jokes and one liners oh please. this has to be worse than the phantom menace \\, yes i NEVER IMAGINED i WOULD EVER SAY SUCH A THING BUT HERE WE ARE\\, HERE WE ARE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME\\, IF YOU ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE ANSWERS FROM EPISODE 7\\, DON'T EVEN BOTHER\\, THIS MOVIE ANSWERS NOTHING AND LEAVES MORE QUESTIONS TO STOCK UP ON. TO ME THIS IS THE END OF THE JEDI. AS QUOTE \\\"THE JEDI MUST END\\\" WELL YOU DID A GOOD JOB ON THAT.","true":true}
