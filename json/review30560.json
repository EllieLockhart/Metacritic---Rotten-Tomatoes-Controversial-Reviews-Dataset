Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sigh. Perhaps it was the hype coming out of TFA and the epic battles in R1\\, but  this just left me underwhelmed. I honestly appreciated the attempts to vary the story line but I felt like ultimately this was the same thing I've seen for 5 movies now. Some of the cgi was notably ......off.Serious threads of the previous installment where underserved or just not brought up at all. What's the point of a sequel? Score was good\\, certain action scenes we're good\\, pacing was off in the sense that there were 2 3rd acts which ultimately end up taking you out of the story\\, way to many coincidences that seemed ridiculous.....Very frustrating.","true":true}
