Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such disappointment!! I can not express fully into words!! There are so many plot holes in this movie\\, that it looks like a spaghetti sift! Also\\, what about the knights of Ren? If Luke didn't want to be found\\, and just die  on the island\\, why leave a damn map!!??  How the jell could rey be so strong and beat snokes guards with no training?! I could go on and on?! Johnson failed miserably\\, and if this one s the guy that Disney has doing the future Star Wars trilogy\\, I know that Star Wars will die!! This movie sucks","true":true}
