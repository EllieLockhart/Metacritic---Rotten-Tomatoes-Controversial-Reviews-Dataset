Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a failure... don't watch if you liked the previous Star Wars movies. Such a disappointment\\, I just cannot believe they'd spent so much money for this Disney tragedy basically written for 9 year olds. Also amazed about the amount of fake critic reviews... quite disrespectful to the audience tbh!","true":true}
