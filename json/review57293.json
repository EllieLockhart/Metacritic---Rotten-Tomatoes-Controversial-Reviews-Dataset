Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an amazing work of art filled with exciting action sequences and well fleshed out characters. Luke Skywalker's story line is PERFECT. The movie's message about failure and letting go of the past is well executed and greatly serves as a worthy second part to this trilogy.","true":true}
