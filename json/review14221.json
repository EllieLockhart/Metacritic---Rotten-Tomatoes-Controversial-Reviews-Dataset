Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it 4 stars in terms of a movie to movie review. If this was a rating for the Star Wars episodes it deserves a 3-3.5 rating. This is an exciting and emotionally driven Star Wars film\\, but two episodes in now\\, the new characters still feel under developed and fail to inspire a new generation of Star Wars genius.  Rey\\, Fin\\, Po\\, and Kylo still don't yet have that \\\"iconic\\\" Star Wars feel\\, and as a result\\, the film forced to be carried by the original Star Wars characters. The Nostalgic experience of seeing some of these great characters one last time makes the movie a must see for any Star Wars fan. \\n\\nWith that being said. Characters like Snoke were anti climatic and failed to give fans a look into what must of been a historic rise to his supreme leadership. While\\, Luke may go down as the most disappointing Jedi to ever be created in the story\\, at no ones fault then the director himself. \\n\\nThe movie is now Forcing the new generation to step up and carry the episodes forward. Which will only draw more skeptism as to whether they are developed enough to bring future success. Disney will be forced to show up next episode and if they fail\\, this will be the last episode worth the watch.","true":true}
