{"101487":141820,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looks and sounds very good but thats it.\\nThis movie nearly destroyed star wars for me and I really dont care about this new triology anymore. I enjoyed Rogue One and TFA was okay but this was garbage.\\nSpoiler!!\\nWhat I didnt like:\\n- it was too long\\n- the humour sucks. There are serious moments that are destroyed by it\\n- the first order feels like a joke\\, especially general hux\\n- Luke Skywalker was always a hopeful character\\, he saw in Darth Vader the good and was a hero but now? He wanted to kill his nephew because he saw the dark side in him? He went on that island to die? Luke Skywalker has no hope anymore? Thats not my Luke Skywalker\\, it feels so disappointed to see him like that\\n- there is not really any training on that island\\n- Rey is still nearly perfect and doesnt need training and there is still no explanation for it. Even Luke needed some years to learn all the things and to confrontate Vader but Rey? She's perfect\\n- Leia flying through space was horrible and cringy\\, shes not trained as far as i know. Its too op\\, she shouldnt be able to do that\\n- physics\\, ok its star wars\\, that point isnt very good but there are many times unlogical things like the bombs falling\\, leia coming back to the ship scene and stuff like that\\n- the new general holdo was very unlikeable\\n- she should tell Poe what the plan is instead there is this unimportant plot on this casino planet which is only for finns screentime\\n- casino planet doesnt feel like star wars\\, they get arrested for parking wrong? Horse race and stuff like that. (and of course the female character has to show stupid finn why everything there is bad...)\\n- the codebreaker isnt loyal to anyone and does only care for money\\, why do they tell him the plans? so stupid\\n- porgs are annoying\\, they are useless\\, only good for merch\\n- it feels in some parts a lot like parts of other star wars movies with copied quotes (e.g. Rey sees the good in Ben\\, Ben tells the same thing as anakin \\\"together we can rule the galaxy\\\" and something like this\\n- why is luke drinking that milk? Why did they show this scene\\, it wasnt funny\\, just horrible\\n- why didnt they let finn sacrifice himself for the rebels? why rose? why this stupid kiss? I didnt see any romance between them in this film\\, why kiss\\n- rose is annoying\\n- holdo flys through snokes ship with hyper space? Destroys logic in star wars\\n- at the end still 1 jedi and 1 evil\\, so nothing changed\\, I thought they will do something new\\, wrong\\n- Rey is a nobody? So shes just op and a mary sue because the plot says that\\, nice\\n- snoke is soooo powerful? Was killed with an easy trick\\, wasnt that disappointed but it could have been better\\n- the last battle shows how stupid the first order is... again\\n- kylo ren doesnt realize that luke is tricking him\\, Kylo Ren shouldl ook more evil now\\, he killed his master\\, he is the new supreme leader! :\/\\n- Luke dies in an disappointet way for me\\n- there was no actual lightsaber fight\\n- phasma is a throw-away character\\, again\\n- bb8 using an at-st? hmm kay \\n- They follow those rebels the whole time and cant reach them because they are too fast? why can they keep up then? They are as fast and the first order could jump into hyper space and come from the side are something like that... there are far too many plot holes\\, bad jokes\\, disappointing answers on important questions from the previous movie\\, a lack of good plot\\, dialogues and character development.\\nIt was very disappointing and it destroys so many Star Wars things\\, the lore is ignored in some parts and it hurts me as a fan.","true":true}
