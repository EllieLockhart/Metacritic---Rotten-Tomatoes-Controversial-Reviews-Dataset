Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a tough one. I don't think it was bad at all\\, but I still greatly enjoyed Force Awakens much more. The opening scene was very entertaining\\, but once it got into the second act I legitimately got bored in a Star Wars movie. When the third act kicks in however\\, I was like\\, \\\"Hey\\, now I'm getting into it.\\\" So\\, overall\\, i didn't enjoy the second act\\, but I still thought it was a good entry in the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
