Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Refreshing\\, honestly. The comedy was occasionally a bit distracting\\, but it was also much better acted\\, written\\, and executed than in Force Awakens or any of the prequels. I enjoyed this movie a lot.","true":true}
