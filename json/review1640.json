Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a massive fan of The Force Awakens\\, I was greatly anticipating The Last Jedi and where it would take us next in that galaxy far\\, far away. The movie was quite a lot to take in and I actually had to see it twice just to solidify my feelings about it\\, because I was so conflicted. I finally determined that it is a good addition to the story and one I will gladly add to my collection. There were a handful of scenes that I found absolutely perfect\\, and those will go down as some of my favorites in the entire Star Wars franchise. Most of those moments came from the interconnected stories of Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Luke Skywalker. Basically any time one of these three characters appeared\\, I was delighted. Rey has quickly become one of my favorite characters in the franchise and a lot of that is because of the charisma of Daisy Ridley\\, and how well she adds deep emotions into her performance. Likewise\\, Kylo Ren is a unique and interesting nemesis for Rey that puts a new twist on what we\u2019ve all become accustomed to seeing in traditional movie villains. Finally\\, Luke (despite what a vocal minority of the internet will tell you) is an older and wiser version of the same character I grew up loving. My heart breaks more than once because of all the things that happen to him in this film. The real problem with The Last Jedi is that it was too long\\, and I actually could feel it dragging more than once. Even worse\\, it was extremely obvious where things could be cut in order to make it a better length. Sadly most of the extraneous stuff came in Finn\u2019s story. John Boyega is a charming actor\\, and a member of the First Order who has turned to work with the Resistance should be one of the most fascinating characters in any Star Wars film\\, but here they have him merely running pointless errands. He has a couple of moments that shine\\, but most of his scenes have so little impact on the plot that he almost could have stayed in a coma and no one would have cared. He is accompanied through most of the film by a new character named Rose\\, who is a sweet young girl that hopefully will do something useful in the next film because she was needless in this one. There is one detour that these characters take that was the worst sequence in the film\\, which felt like it was plucked straight out of a George Lucas prequel. However\\, I discovered on my second viewing that it wasn\u2019t as long as it felt the first time\\, and the rest of their story is not bad at all. I also think there is an opportunity set up for the next film to give more meaning to that one annoying sequence\\, which may make it better to me in retrospect. The third storyline going on in The Last Jedi is the one with Poe\\, Leia\\, and a new character played by Laura Dern named Holdo. These scenes were sometimes great and sometimes terrible. I hated the look of Holdo\\, and Dern\u2019s performance was bad\\, but her actions mostly worked for me. A leader who can stand in for Leia\\, but one we don\u2019t know if we can trust because we don\u2019t have the same history with her\\, is a good addition to the plot. The handling of Carrie Fisher was a bit clumsy because we all know she died after the filming of this movie. There were a few places where they could have adjusted the story slightly to make a lovely farewell to a character (and more importantly an actress) that we all loved. Sadly\\, they had other plans for her. Poe got some nice character growth in this movie\\, and I think that will carry over to make him a more engaging presence in the future. Naturally\\, I wish that The Last Jedi had been another perfect film and that it had impressed me as thoroughly as the four chapters before it. I did have complaints and there\u2019s no denying certain moments in this film will probably always make me cringe. But when I let go of my nitpicks\\, I find that the elements I loved were strong enough to outshine all my complaints and make this a moderate success.","true":true}
