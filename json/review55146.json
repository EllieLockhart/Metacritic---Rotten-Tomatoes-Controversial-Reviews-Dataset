Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed with the movie. \\nHumor was to much ''marvel-like'' and put in the wrong place (what !? Luke throwing his light-saber after Rey give it to him ?)\\n\\nThe whole casino scene make no sense.\\n\\nLea should have died.\\n\\nThe way Snoke die is just plain stupid and his back story is never explained.\\n\\nThere was to much ''I want to sell this product''. So to much little Porgs scene to Disney can sell them to children's. The last scene in the movie\\, where there is a little boy look like Disney wanted to tell child ''you can be a Jedi to''\\, so it can sell a few plastic light-saber.\\n\\nThere wasn't a cool Jedi fight scene. Fight in this movie suck compare to the last one in The Force Awaken.","true":true}
