Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this film! There were twists\\, turns and by the end\\, I was nearly brought to tears. Yes\\, it has faults as all good movies do. But this film is solid.","true":true}
