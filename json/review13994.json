Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you haven't seen this movie\\, and you're a big fan of the original trilogy\\, do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague.\\n\\nMy two biggest complaints about this movie are:\\n\\n1: The director and producer shoved their feminist ideology at the audience hard in this movie. All of the Resistance women were portrayed as smarter\\, wiser\\, or more kind than any man in the movie\\, while there wasn't a single man in the movie that wasn't presented in some sort of negative fashion. There are no men portrayed in a positive fashion in this movie.\\n\\n2: In their effort to push their feminist ideology they completely dumped all over the character and legacy of Luke Skywalker. At one point Mark Hamill said it felt like he was playing a completely different character. After watching this train wreck I can say\\, he's right. He's not the Luke I grew up with.\\n\\nSave your money and avoid this abomination. It is so bad that I will not watch Episode 9.","true":true}
