Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Snoke explanation\\nPointless Casino Planet\\nFirst Order isnt smart enough to use one of their star destroyers to flank the rebels and blow them up so they end up slowly chasing them for hours like idiots.\\nlightsabers can now be turned on and off using the force....smh\\\\nRey gets the most anticlimatic answer to her parents backstory\\npo is made to look like a complete incompetent fool\\nR2D2 is used to sell toys for 30 seconds of the film.\\nRey still has been taught next to nothing but is very powerful and somehow knows how to use the force as good as Kylo Ren \\nNO LIGHTSABER FIGHTS AT ALL.\\noverused \\\"empire has a super advanced weapon that renders us powerless but we get lucky and win anyway\\\" cliche \\nFinn and Rose are useless\\nKerry Fisher Marry Poppins confirmed.\\ndreadnot didnt have shields for some reason\\nHorrible editing with no satisfying transitions. \\nscript could have been written better by Michael Bay\\nkilled off Admiral Akbar without giving him any lines whatsoever.\\ninstead used some purple haired lady to lead the rebellion when they couldve just used an already established well loved character to do her job (Admiral AKbar)\\nagain\\, Snoke was the most dissapointing character in star wars history killed off before his story is explained when he was core to the story.","true":true}
