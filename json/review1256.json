Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pretty disappointing movie whose sole purpose seems to be to shame every male character relentlessly. Many of the characters were alright\\, but Admiral Holdo was wholly unreasonable and generally cringey to watch. She ruined that entire segment of the film. There's more that isn't worth dredging up. Dont waste your money.","true":true}
