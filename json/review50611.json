Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3 Reasons why we just got Our \\\"Knights Of The Old Republic I & II\\\" in one movie\\, TLJ\\n\\nSPOILERS\\n\\n1- Connect through the force:\\nKylo Ren and Rey share a connection through the force after facing one another in combat resulting in the dark side user being seriously injured and eventually teaming up just like Revan and Bastilla. However\\, Snoke was responsible for telepathic communication initially\\, but I believe at the end they achieve it by themselves. Fans wanted a physical relationship in Reylo and barely got a taste of being allies. Also\\, Traya and the Exlie share an even more pronounced connection and ability to converse via force Skype throughout the second game. One of the most unique and one of my favorite parts of both games. \\n\\n2- Master was betrayed by apprentice:\\nUnlike Vader turning to the light to kill The emperor\\, Kylo killed Snoke with the dark side in mind and to usurp him. Revan was almost Slain by Malak from starship fire. Darth Traya was betrayed by Nihilus and Sion\\, and Snoke was successfully destroyed.....Maybe?!?!? Fans are mixed because many had spun theories for two years as to what the Orgins of Snoke where. But ask yourself\\, did you like KotoR II when the Orgins of your enemies Sion\\, Nihilus\\, and Ultimately Traya hardly came in to play\\, allowing the mysticism and mystery of their powers? Kylo was Pulling Occlumency on Snoke H Piddy style. Kylo outsmarted one of the most powerful\\, if not the most powerful force users and we don't think that is bad ass? I loved it\\, classic Darkside tactics apprentice versus Master style. \\n\\n3- Force lore and powers: \\nLeia using Force Shield and force pull in space. Luke using force projection to deceive Kylo and bide time for the resistance to escape and force Skype utilized by Snoke on Rey and Kylo introduced new powers like our favorite two Star Wars games. Luke cutting himself off from the force just as The Exile is cut off from the force in backstory cutscenes in KotoR II. The Darkside calling to Rey while reaching out through the Tunnel\/Mirrior\/Portal and just like Malachor V\/Korriban\/The Unknown Regions called to Revan in KotoR I & II.","true":true}
