Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a dis-service to the previous seven movies that preceded it. For a movie that is a sequel and part of a Trilogy\\, it doesn't follow up or expand upon building up the major plot points introduced in the previous episode; it takes all the momentum and the major plot points of interest and ends them rather abruptly - basically taking the best of the previous movie and treating it as throw away garbage.
