Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to change my rating to one full star because rotten tomatoes does not count any rating less than one star in their stats... This movie doesn't deserve any stats though. No spoilers here: I'm sadly disappointed. So much was enjoyable in this film\\, but the director was too interested in making everything different. Entertaining to watch but leaves a nasty taste in your mouth after. If you love star wars hard core\\, this movie will most likely get under your skin. If Ryan Johnson is doing the new trilogy\\, I will vote with my money and not go. ","true":true}
