Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ruined a good thing. The Last Jedi was such a let down that it made me actually appreciate the prequels which were an embarrassment. Rogue One is the only movie outside the original trilogy 4\\,5\\,6 that was actually good. I understand Rian did not make a movie to satisfy the fans\\, but then why make the movie at all? You aren't making the movie for yourself Rian. And yes you can always use the excuse can't please everyone\\, but look at rogue one and 4\\,5\\,6. LET GARETH EDWARDS DO EPISODE 9. Save us!","true":true}
