Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time posting on Rotten Tomatoes.  I wanted to join the throngs saying that The Last Jedi was a bore.  I really didn't care about the plot.  Kylo Ren confuses me and the action was snooze-worthy.  Daisy Ridley's acting kept me awake\\, thank goodness.  My daughter liked the little penguin things.","true":true}
