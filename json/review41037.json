Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie felt more like a Marvel movie with a Star Wars skin then it felt like an actual Star Wars movie. The fact that this movie has a 92% from critics is baffling to me. There were a ton of inconsistencies and plot holes\\, forced humour that comes off cringeworthy\\, plotlines from TFA were completely thrown away in favour of pointless side plots\\, Characters from the OT are only here to serve as nostalgic fanservice and many times they even act completely out  of character.\\nAt this point Star Wars has become Disney fan fiction and I can't believe they made the Expanded Universe non canon in favour of this drivel.","true":true}
