Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of holes\\, too much over the top liberty taken by director.  Loss the magic of the old ones.  Dumb foofy disney penguins and crystal foxes clearly made for toy profit.\\nWhy is there no development of Snoke?  Weak villains make weak heroes.  There are no more jedi masters?  Rey is once again overpowered without character development.\\nNot that exciting\\, over hyped.  Disney movies are good\\, Star wars movies are great.  Disney Star Wars movies\\, not so good.","true":true}
