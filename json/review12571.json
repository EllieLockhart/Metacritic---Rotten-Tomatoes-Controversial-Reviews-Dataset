Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't decide whether I like this movie or not. There were some awesome moments and the acting was very well done. I liked the general story arch of Rey\\, Luke and Kylo.\\n\\nThe major downsides to this movie are the following: Super lazy story writing\\, Finn and Rose's mission was a waste of screen time and boring. There were a lot of eye roll moments for me. Finally\\, I did not like the way Luke was handled at the end.","true":true}
