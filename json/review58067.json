{"101487":197392,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With the exception of being disappointed with The Phantom Menace\\, that's been the only Star Wars movie that I've generally ever really been disappointed in. Until now. The Last Jedi is different than the Phantom Menace as it doesn't deal with the prequel characters or plot lines. It deals with the original trilogy characters. Those characters have been beloved and a part of Americana since the 1970s. Luke Skywalker. Han Solo. Leia Organa. ObiWan Kenobi. Chewbacca. Lando Calrissian. Have all become archetypes of \\\"the good guys\\\" and are part of societal lexicon. They are the people kids imagine themselves to be when they are heroes. I can go on and on. Suffice to say I thought The Force Awakens handled this responsibility well. I really liked it. While it was \\\"safe\\\" it was also good and entertaining. Then I saw Rogue One which was one of the best Star Wars films ever\\, I was REALLY looking forward the Last Jedi. Until I saw it. After the movie was over I walked out of the theatre in disappointment. Probably worse than the Phantom Menace. While the Phantom Menace was just a let down from waiting 20 years and the movie was a dud\\, the Last Jedi really missed the mark when it comes to Luke. I don't want to post spoilers\\, but you take one of the most recognizable names in movies and culture and made him into a bumbling and grumpy old man. I can't imagine this is what any fan of the series would've imagined. I can make some allowances for artistic expression\\, wanting to introduce new characters or whatever but this was just utter disappointment. Luke deserved better. Additionally the action sequences were few and far between. They weren't that good. There were also several plot lines and characters that were unnecessary and boring. I hope JJ Abrams can save the series. Not impressed with Rian's (or Disney's) vision for the series.","true":true}
