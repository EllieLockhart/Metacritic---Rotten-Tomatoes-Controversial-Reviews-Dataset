Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"50% audience score? No thank you. No idea how the critics are so out of touch with the audience. They totally messed up Star Wars and they now know it. I am not sure how they are going to recover the story moving forward.","true":true}
