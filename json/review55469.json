Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most disappointment i have had watching a SW film to date...Like Mark Hamill said...I fundamentally disagree with every choice tht was written for Luke in this movie.....While i would have given TFA a solid 4\/5 stars even though maybe had a little too much in common with a new hope....it respected the franchise...it was like a film by a fan for the fans.....this was just a mess from start to finish....horrible choices for Luke....flying Leia....ill timed comedic moments....Finn and Rose and no romantic chemistry tht plotline made me cringe....JJ made a solid film with episode 7 and Rhian took a dump all over it...episode 7 left me with nostalgia\\,hope.excitement for for things to come...this one left me sad...just sad...And feeling really sorry for Mark Hamill...And JJ Abrams.this movie was not what Mark or the die-hard fans deserve....Good luck JJ with ep9 u will need it.","true":true}
