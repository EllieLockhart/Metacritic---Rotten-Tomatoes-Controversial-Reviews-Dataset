Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert\\n\\nmost of what was set up from episode VII was trashed.  most of the lore established from episodes 1-6 was trashed.  it was nearly pointless for rey to meet luke skywalker. I found myself nearly bored between the uneventful slow chase scene with resistance people arguing back and forth\\, luke not really training rey\\, the casino snooze scene.  most of the movie wasn't necessary and didn't add to the plot.  Kylo Ren becomes \\\"complete\\\" with resolve after killing snoke (whose character was trashed) but still maintains an emotional teenager personality as the new supreme leader.  Snoke was supposed to be worse than the last emperor and Vader and had powers at unbelievably high levels but couldn't sense or see out of the corner of his eye killing intent and a lightsaber turning on its own.  captain phasma ends up being a throw away character.  fin was essentially a throw away character that found a girlfriend? who fell in love with him after saving some animals in 18 hours.  If you can call this new trilogy a reboot then you can call this new star wars movie a reboot of a reboot which just leaves you confused.  ultimately most things will be forgiven if episode IX cleans up all the trashing that episode VIII does to the established lore and franchise.  Overall I didn't hate it but I don't care to see it again or talk about it after this review.  meh","true":true}
