Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. It made me laugh. It had me on the edge of my seat and I believe it was another great addition to the Star Wars universe. I have a feeling it's going to be my favorite of the newest trilogy (however The Empire Strikes Back will always be my favorite Star Wars movie). The music\\, cinematography\\, characters\\, sets and story were well executed. I left the theater wanting to see it again. I've read other comments and reviews seeing this one in a negative light and I can't believe we've watched the same movie. Your best bet is going into this movie without giving weight to others' opinions and form your own. It's entertaining. It's an experience. That's what you want from a movie and I truly believe The Last Jedi delivers exactly that.","true":true}
