TheIt\u2019s a shame to see people pile this game with negative reviews. The narrative is only one part of what makes a game great\\, and Naughty Dog has achieved some amazing feats of artistic triumph with this title. Please don\u2019t let the negative user scores dissuade you from buying this game as they almost did for me. This game wrings every bit of graphical fidelity out of the PS4 Pro. The puzzles are satisfying to solve\\, combat is intense without being too much for the average player\\, and the character models are at times so convincingly lifelike that you feel you are watching a film. They reach across the uncanny valley in a way few games can. Some people don\u2019t like the tone of the game and will give a zero without honestly reflecting on the other aspects of it that make it a spectacular experience. Collectibles\\, hidden areas\\, upgrading your weapons\\, one-off interactions with other characters\\, finding secret caches of supplies with notes adding backstory\u2014all of these small things make the game worth playing on their own. The story is sad\\, and melancholy at times\\, but you know what else is sad? LIFE! It\u2019s an honest reflection of truthful emotion that doesn\u2019t accede to the typical glass half full view of most plots in games\/film. I imagine many people reacted to the famously grim dystopian novel \u201c1984\u201d in the same way\\, before realizing it\u2019s actually a bloody masterpiece. Regardless of how you feel about the plot\\, giving a work of art such as this a score of zero or one is insulting to the hundreds of creators who so obviously poured their passion into crafting a living\\, breathing world for us to enjoy. I can\u2019t wait for whatever Naughty Dog has in store for the next installment!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
