Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot makes no sense and there is no character development. Visually\\, the movie is great\\, as expected. However\\, the cool action scenes are completely undercut by massive plotholes (Rey being far better with a saber than the elite guards\\, using lightspeed as a weapon etc.). The way they handled Luke and Leia was just awful.","true":true}
