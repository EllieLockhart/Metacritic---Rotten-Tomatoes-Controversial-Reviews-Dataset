I am at a 7 because I find it to have very fun gameplay it improved its game play from the first game in almost every way. When I was playing the game I was wondering how any one could hate this game? But that\u2019s when I got to the part when Joel dies from Abby which made me angry because why would they do that but I got over it and got back into the game and I was in joying myself for about 12 hours when we were at the part I thought was the climax with Abby pointing a gun at Ellie I was very invested when we cut back to Abby as a kid when I was like what the hell. But I kept playing just waiting for the game to take us back to Ellie but it was taking a very long time so I googled how long is the Abby sections to find out it\u2019s about the same length of time as the Ellie portion. That made me want to just stop playing since I did not like the Abby character. Naughty dog wanted you to feel for her.. but I just didn\u2019t. Eventually we get back to the part where Abby is pointing a gun at Ellie when I\u2019m like yes now I get to kill Abby but no we are still playing as Abby trying to kill Ellie. When you leave Ellie coughing up blood on the floor. Now it\u2019s been a bit and you play as ellie again and you have a farm house with there baby living a good life when for some reason ellie feels like she needs to go kill abby so she leaves Dina which at this point in the game you don\u2019t care any more you just want the game to be done but whatever you go to this place where Abby is to kill her but Abby has been put in prison and is very weak so when ellie finds her she lets her down then wants to have a fight when Abby bites her fingers off and Ellie lets Abby go making it all feel pointless. Ellie goes back home to find Dina has left her and the game ends with Ellie loosing every thing leaving you unsatisfied. Anyway the half the story I did not enjoy but the other half was great the graphics are the best voice acting is perfect and I had an ok time playing this game so I give it a 7.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
