Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had so many good things going for it\\, but so many marks were missed.  It was a hot mess of a movie that ignored plot points of the previous film and felt as though it was written as a standalone movie rather than the 2nd in a trilogy.  I'm not left wanting more. I'm only confused at the choices that were made for the characters and lack of story development.","true":true}
