Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good moments\\, but sloooow in a 'can we please move on'\\, Kubrick-esque sort of way\\, with battle scenes inspired by World War I combat methods (in space? with lasers? really?).  Unimaginative and disappointing.  I was so glad when Luke showed up again\\, because I knew that it was finally about to end.","true":true}
