Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"While not *quite* as tight in its storytelling as the first game (both Abby and Ellie\u2019s individual sections drag a little) the ambition of this sequel is incredible and something that I haven\u2019t seen in a story-driven game to this level before. Naughty Dog took risks in their storytelling that ultimately paid off in their intention to make an entire player-ship question their motives and morals throughout. For all of the complaints about this being a game that \u2018disrespects\u2019 Joel\\, ultimately this wound up being a love-letter to Joel\\, while somehow simultaneously understanding how his actions could drive somebody to revenge\\, allowing us to understand their motives at the same time. Gameplay is much improved from the first\\, with general encounters being considerably more engaging\\, and set-pieces\\, especially the Scar Island Escape allowing for the gameplay to be leagues ahead of the first game. It\u2019s also beautiful enough to almost qualify as next-hen\\, and ultimately will be remembered as *the* game of this generation of PlayStation games. Masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
