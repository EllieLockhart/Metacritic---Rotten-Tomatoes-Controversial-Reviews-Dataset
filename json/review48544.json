Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worlds and investment in visual galaxy diversity underdeveloped compared w\/prequels; sacrificed threat to galaxies w\/ too much focus on and fragmentation into individual journeys - but managed to salvage some in ending. Production value mediocre - where did the money go? Directing (camera\\, editing) mediocre. Loved Guardians but enough quip mimicking - Star War's is the classic.  Hope JJ gets the money he needs to make a redeeming killer 3rd installment.","true":true}
