Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a disappointing plot and terribly developed characters new and old\\, The Last Jedi effectively damages the Star Wars universe by blatantly disregarding the things that make it great.\\n\\nLight vs. Dark\\, gone. Strong villains that feel like a real threat\\, gone. Personable characters that you care live or die\\, gone (and killed off with minimal literary effect). The list goes on.\\n\\nWhat we are left with is eye candy - some very sweet candy indeed. The world looks and feels like Star Wars. Visually\\, it's by far the best I've ever seen. This is the film's only saving grace. But that's all you get. Look past the surface and the plot holes assail your mind with minimal effort. Best way to describe it - Pirates of the Carribbean in space.\\n\\nThe set pieces are entertaining\\, yet hollow. The characters empowered and diverse\\, but unbelievable (and unlikable\/forgettable as a result). The story itself seems so set on promoting relativism\\, or some nihilistic variant\\, that it feels artificial and at times\\, just plain disrespectful to the foundation it's built upon (including the fans). Disney clearly wants to \\\"kill\\\" the resonating narrative of light vs. dark\\, replacing it with\\, well\\, the movie never figures that out. It reminds us that not only failure is okay\\, but that we do not need to rise above that to become \\\"heroes\\\". Everyone is a hero\\, no matter how hard they train\\, how much they learn\\, what they do or sacrifice. Everyone is a hero\\, so we are left feeling that no one is.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend keeping an open mind when going to see this iteration of Star Wars as I did. There are a lot of entitled opinions out there\\, especially the disparity between critics and fans\\, that make it easy to mute legitimate critical analysis of this movie. I think the main reason that The Last Jedi failed so hard wasn't the raw new content it introduces\\, but how that content was introduced\/executed. Director Rian Johnson was plain lazy at points\\, relying heavily on the slick post production editing to polish the rough edges. Some narrative choices would 100% be easily avoided if Rian had his script peer reviewed. The entire movie feels like a rough draft with great ideas\\, but sorely in need of restructuring.\\n\\nIn any case\\, the damage by The Last Jedi caused is not entirely irreparable. Here's to hoping the next episode makes more sense and carries with it more believable characters.","true":true}
