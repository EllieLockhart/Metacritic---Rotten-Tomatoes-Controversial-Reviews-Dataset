Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I saw this movie I was not pleased with what I saw. I was mostly angry that it was not the Star Wars that I knew and loved. Upon watching it a second time with a much more open mind I realized how amazing it really was. Rain Johnson took Star Wars and moved it into a direction that no one expected. It was fresh and different and I believe that it needed to happen. I will say there are parts that I was not a fan of such as the Finn and Rose story line as well as the forced one line humor\\, but overall the story of Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Snoke were beautifully done. As much as some fans are hating this movie\\, I truly think they are more frustrated that their theories of the last 2 years have not come true. All in all\\, fantastic movie\\, wonderful job ","true":true}
