Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Disney first announced their grand plans for a reboot of the Star Wars universe\\, I immediately called upon them to accept the existing canon\\, warts and all. People fail to understand just involved the vetting process was for the majority of books that exist in the Expanded Universe and while there are some odder entries\\, there are also many\\, many decades of high quality films prepped for adaptation\\, built into a carefully constructed continuity. When Disney announced their disregard and disowning of that same canon and lore\\, ostensibly to roll out their own replacement line of books\\, action figures\\, and other accompanying toys\\, I predicted\\, forcibly\\, that it would be their undoing. Perhaps a better name for The Last Jedi might have been The Last Disney. As with the Jedi of the prequels\\, overconfidence has been their undoing. Spoilers ahead.\\n\\nComing into The Last Jedi (hearafter TLJ)\\, it was clear that Disney was seeing the light as well\\, at least to a certain degree. It isn't like the new continuity books had been instant classics (or really made any impact at all) and the Mouse House clearly was looking for ideas. It was announced that an adaptation of Thrawn would return\\, unsurprisingly\\, opening the door for Disney to use what I imagine will be a veritable emergency slide of necessary creative injections. Unfortunately\\, The Force Awakens (hereafter TFA) had dug its own grave\\, namely setting up a series of confusing time and space logistical choices for the three military\/political factions involved (First Order\/Republic\/Resistance) that proved annoyingly confusing in TFA but have multiplied to become straight-up catastrophes in TLJ\\, threatening to pull viewers out of the story completely. \\n\\nThe film begins with a sped up planetary evacuation scene\\, the tail-end of a Battle of Hoth\/Empire Strikes Back type sequence flipped around in reverse (a common \\\"trick\\\" used throughout the film) that is immediately intercepted by a newly revitalized First Order on the attack. As you can imagine\\, this is the first (and most minor) toss to any adult watching. Didn't the Resistance just destroy an enormously expensive (both in manpower and in credits) piece of weaponry? Didn't the First Order get implicated in the destruction the New Republic's main planet? Did they really manage to destroy all the fleets of both the Resistance and the New Republic as well as the private sector without anyone catching on? Also\\, where are we in the galaxy? How is First Order pumping out Star Destroyers like candy? These questions are compounded when\\, after a semi-failed bombing run (by bombers that manage\\, incredibly\\, to look less advanced than the ones used in Return of the Jedi\\, earlier in the series)\\, another jump reveals another superweapon (after planetary bombardment by previous star destroyer mounted superweapons) with more star destroyers in what appears to be the Wal-Mart of First Order military hardware. This sets up the second act chase sequence and leaves us wondering\\, with hardware like this\\, who really cares about one carrier ship? The Empire of the original trilogy was concerned about a Rebel Alliance actively acquiring ships and fleets and fighters (albeit not top of the line) that were proceeding to ambush key supply lines with superior tactics.
