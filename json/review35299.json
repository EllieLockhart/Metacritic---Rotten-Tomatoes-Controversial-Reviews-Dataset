Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The heroes did nothing to really endear themselves to fans. The single most heroic thing in Last Jedi was Chewy turning down fresh roasted meat. Outside of that\\, the heroes were a bust and the script pretty slow.","true":true}
