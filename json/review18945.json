Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s awful. It doesn\u2019t even resemble a Star Wars movie. If you like this movie you\u2019re taste should be in serious question - don\u2019t cling onto Star Wars fandom of old. It\u2019s a single-noted\\, cluttered mess. 1\/2 Star for Benecio del Toro","true":true}
