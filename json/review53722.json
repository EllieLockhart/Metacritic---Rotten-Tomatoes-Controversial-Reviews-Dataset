Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving it one star is being generous\\, as I have never had such high expectations for a movie (and no\\, I'm not one of those fans upset because his fan theories didn't go as planned) only to be let down tremendously.  I never felt a feeling of hopelessness after seeing what this movie destroyed\\, the great semblance of the universe that made Star Wars great.   With conflicting plot holes\\, superfluous slap-stick comedy\\, general out-of-character development and lack of development in general\\, an inconsistent tone and pacing\\, there was no Star Wars that was esoteric for us fans for so many years.  I understand what Johnson tried to do making it \\\"his own\\\"\\, but you cannot achieve that when you try to undermine something that is already built with a story in place.  If you want to do that in your own saga\\, set in the far past or future\\, then by all means\\, I would be all for it.   I just hope Episode 9 can redeem what little hope there is to making the next chapter remotely enjoyable.","true":true}
