Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well... there is something with this movie thats not so good.. \\nI dont feel i watching a SW movie\\, it feels like a drama with a bad script\\,  The timeframe with the two main storys don\u00b4t match. This is by far the worst SW movie yet and thats to bad because the Force Awakens and Rouge One are both really good.","true":true}
