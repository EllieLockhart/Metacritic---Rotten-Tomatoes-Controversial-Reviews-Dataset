{"101487":185413,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-06","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me fear the future of the Star Wars franchise. Without going into spoilers or details\\, this movie has numerous plot points that conflict with other canon star wars films\\, it also has numerous plot points that conflict with itself (throughout the same film)\\, and furthermore it has numerous plot points that don't make any logical sense at all. \\n\\nRey is almost non-existent in this film. The entire middle part side story of the movie on casino planet was boring\\, distracting\\, and ultimately pointless (remove those 45 mins from the film and it would have no impact on the rest of the movie or series). In fact\\, if you remove this movie from the franchise\\, there is very little character development or progress made to push the larger story through. No major changes happen to any characters other than Kylo Ren. What the heck were they thinking when they wrote\/ filmed\/ edited the dramatic Princess Lei scene (if you watched the movie you know what I am referring to)? This was again so silly and ultimately pointless (we know she has to die before Episode 9) and this could have been a great way to send her off\\, but nope\\, we decide to do this instead? Not only is it goofy and sloppy in general\\, but now they have to kill her off in another manner than will probably be far less powerful. Plus she didnt even do anything throughout the rest of the movie\\, so why bring her back? Again this movie made no sense.\\n\\nSo if i hate it so much\\, why did i rate it 2 stars instead of .5 stars? Well there are some cool space scenes and special effects that were enjoyable to watch. I enjoyed the fight sequence with Snoke's royal guards. But ultimately I wish this film never existed. I can't believe I am typing this sentence right now\\, but I have to say it: It is in fact WORSE than the prequels. Yes\\, its worse than the prequels. Disney did a good job with Rogue One and The Force Awakens\\, but this movie was an absolute disgrace and hopefully Disney can salvage what they have done to this franchise in future films like \\\"Solo\\\" and Episode 9.","true":true}
