Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They did not treat Luke respectfully. His death was awkward and he was not written well at all. Didn\u00e2(TM)t even feel like Luke. The casino scene was totally out of place\\, and don\u00e2(TM)t even get me started on Rose. Awful character and pointless. It just doesn\u00e2(TM)t feel like Star Wars anymore. The only good parts are some of the action scenes. Would not recommend.","true":true}
