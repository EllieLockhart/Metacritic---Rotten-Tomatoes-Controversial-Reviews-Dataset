Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the biggest insult to long time fans. The way they handled Luke's character is worthy of a lynch mob. Disney needs to implode. I am so tired of (((them))) taking beloved franchises and turning them into shitty SJW pandering messes. It's nothing short of a big middle finger to both long time fans and white people in general. If you like this movie and over the age of 16\\, you should be ashamed.","true":true}
