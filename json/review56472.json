Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film that divided a fan base. Filled with plot holes. Yet there is so much going on\\, it will take you a while to figure out what bugs you about it. \\nUltimately\\, the utter disrespect it gave to the legacy character of Luke Skywalker is what sealed the deal for me. \\nIt is fine to create and push new characters\\, just do not do it at the expense of ones we have loved for decades.","true":true}
