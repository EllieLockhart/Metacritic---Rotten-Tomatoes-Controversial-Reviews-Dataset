Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was alright.\\n\\nFor an Empire Strikes Back remake. With hour-long subplots that LITERALLY go nowhere. And no character development. And less imagination than the prequels. And more plot-holes than a 90's B-movie.\\n\\nOk so the entire thing was an absolute cluster-fuck who's entire success hinges on nostalgia for movies that people don't even remember anymore.\\n\\nI miss George- wait no. I miss Paul Hirsch\\, Marcia Lucas\\, and Richard Chew.","true":true}
