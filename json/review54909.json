Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It should be completely scrapped.\\nThis movie failed miserably on its purpose.\\nThe actors had no fault on this massive failure.\\nBad script.\\nTerrible story.\\nWith so many already stories ready on the Star Wars universe I wonder who is wasting money destroying this franchise by investing in such shallow scripting.","true":true}
