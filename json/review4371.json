Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't understand the critics +ve reviews.  This movie is an incoherent mess.  I understand that Disney is waving away the public criticism as bot driven hating.  What a crock.  Its a turkey (so I suppose its good that it arrived in time for Christmas).   One can only hope that JJ (when he comes back to the franchise)\\, can un-turkey the whole shebang.  A tall order I think\\, but possibly do-able.  I guess we can't have Kylo wake up in the shower like Booby Ewing\\, and realise the whole thing was a bad dream.  The truth will be bourne out of how many people purchase the blu-rays\/DVDs or rewatch via the streaming services.  When those numbers come in... you'll know if it was as good as its being cracked up to be... but from where I'm sitting... I think those numbers will suck!","true":true}
