Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One Star for some good special effects.\\n- acting was bad (seems like acting only supports \\\"funny dialogues\\\" and action scenes)\\n- story doesn't compete with the \\\"old\\\" Star Wars Saga (EP I - VI) and is build around action scenes\\n- awful \\\"funny\\\" dialogues\\, mostly done to initiate action scenes and even more funny jabbering\\n- could be a movie made by The Asylum if there would be more boobs\\, altough there was too much of action scenes\\, funny scenes and jabbering.\\n- if one associates Star Wars with Jedi myths\\, Sith lore or the Cantina Band: this movie destroys every former belief","true":true}
