Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are many reasons why I didn't like this movie but some of the biggest reasons are Rey's parents\\, Captain Phasma not being used\\, Snoke not being important\\, the useless and boring mission with Finn and Rose\\, No Han Solo\\, Luke not believing in Kylo is what made Kylo turn to the dark side even though Luke didn't give up on DARTH FREAKIN VADER and in the end it paid off\\, and the list goes on but the absolute worst part of the movie is the Liberal agenda that this movie is seeping with... it makes me feel dirty just watching this movie.","true":true}
