Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent addition to the Star Wars universe. \\nRey and Kylo are much more realised characters\\, and their dynamic together works excellently. The choice for Luke to be a very different person to when we last saw him in Return of the Jedi was a good one\\, it makes him more interesting and realistic after a thirty year period.\\nThe effects are of the ridiculously high standard we've come to expect from Disney's Star Wars films\\, and the cinematography is state of the art.\\nAlthough this movie can feel a little bloated (particularly in the subplot concerning Finn and newly introduced Rose) it remains a highly entertaining\\, visually stunning movie that takes a risky path\\, a welcome change after the familiar and fan-appealing The Force Awakens.","true":true}
