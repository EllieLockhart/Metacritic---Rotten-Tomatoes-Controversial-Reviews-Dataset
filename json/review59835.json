I understand what ND were going for but I don\u2019t think they did it well. This game does not feel like The Last Of Us\\, it feels like an entirely different game. The story is full of many plot holes and suffers from poor writing\\, carrying nothing from the first game and making me think the developers did not realise what made the first game so good.I also however appreciate the gameplay\\, graphics and soundtrack. I also think having lesbian characters in the game can be a help as many people will play this game but overall I am just very disappointed.to\u2026 Expand","true":true}
