Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible joke of a \\\"star wars\\\" film. Disgrace to George Lucas\\, luckily he made a fortune off Disney yet they can be as mainstream & off-topic as they want. Very boring film\\, there was maybe one halfway-original Jedi battle to try and please the audience. They threw in plenty of random characters that had no importance to a single part of the once great Star Wars legend. And they proceeded to follow with a series of corny jokes\\, while every sub-par character expressed their drama with the other side. Not much happened in the movie overall\\, and sadly Skywalker did not achieve a thing besides passing away (RIP) after not teaching a soul the first thing about the Force. It was overall a terrible movie with little action\\, but it may have a chance to win an Oscar due to being one of the best dramas since The Breakfast Club. \\nGeorge Lucas you are already missed.","true":true}
