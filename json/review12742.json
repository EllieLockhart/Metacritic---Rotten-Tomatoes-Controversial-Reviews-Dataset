Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account on RT to write this: I'm very disappointed. The only good thing about TLJ were the visuals. At the end I didn't care who lives or dies. For me that was very surprising\\, because I liked the heroes in TFA. Besides all that silly stuff like invincible Leia flying through space\\, they left us with huge plot holes\\, answers like \\\"What ? You wanted to know who Rey's parents are? Stupid you\\, it doesn't matter!\\\" with no flashbacks or drama and no real hope that Star Wars 9 will be any better. I'm officially done with this franchise.","true":true}
