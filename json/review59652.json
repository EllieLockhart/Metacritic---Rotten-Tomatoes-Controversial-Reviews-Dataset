Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok so Im about half way through the game and first of all that's alot longer than most people played before rating it. People rated this game a low score 2 hours in where something major happens.  It's stupid don't listen to the reviews their all just mad baby's who can't take a sad hard deep story.  This game is amazing from the beautiful graphics to the intriguing characters and storyOk so Im about half way through the game and first of all that's alot longer than most people played before rating it. People rated this game a low score 2 hours in where something major happens.  It's stupid don't listen to the reviews their all just mad baby's who can't take a sad hard deep story.  This game is amazing from the beautiful graphics to the intriguing characters and story and the writing is excellent. This Is by far one my most favorite games ever. It drew me in so quick and yes they do have similar mechanics from the first game but I mean what do you expect. There's not much you can do to a system that's not flawed. They made the game play smoother\\, more fun\\, and it perfected it. This is some of the best stealth game play that I have ever seen. It's so fun and just so amazing. This game is phenomenal and don't think it's bad by just playing till a major story beat happens. Spend some time with it.  And also to all the people who were completely shocked by what happened\\, come on seriously you should've known it would happen. Where else would they take the story and make it as good as the last one.   The game is phenomenal\u2026 Expand","true":true}
