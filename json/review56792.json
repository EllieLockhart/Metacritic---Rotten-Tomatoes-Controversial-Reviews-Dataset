Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original character motivations and the story arch of what led the known loved characters of 4\\,5\\,and 6 seemed to be completely ignored.  Luke\\, the son of Anakin\\, decides to save his father in 6\\, then tries to fail as a uncle and attempts to murder his nephew because of force premonition? No mention of what upset the knights of Ren at all in 8.  Why did they join Kylo? Who knows... We don't as fans because it was never brought up at all in 8.  The space race without explanation of the plan to get to safety\\, Why?  Then light speed battering ram?! Why did the rebels not do this in 4 and 6\\, oh yeah shields\\, they must have lost that technology.  and while we are talking about new technology space bombers... how does a bomb fall in space? i know the answer is the bombs are magnetized... what are the resistance ships made of plastic?  Also let us not forget the free the racing dogs\\, gotta save them\\, but the enslaved children on this planet\\, meh they got this.  This series needed a complete overhaul and Disney isn't listening\\, but rather attempting to rake in the cash\\, which is expected.  But not at the extent of merely using the label of Star Wars.  Disney isn't the \\\"Field of Dreams\\\"\\, if you build it they will come.  If you don't listen to the fans\\, they will stop paying.","true":true}
