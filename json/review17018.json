Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand the negative reviews on this film. It seems that people just can't seem to move on from the first 3 films\\, and turn their nose up at new concepts and ideas that are presented as the saga moves forward. From the acting and story\\, to the set pieces and sound the film is great. I will admit it has a couple of \\\"random\\\" moments\\, such as space Leia and the casino\\, but as films go this it was a great \\\"sit back and enjoy\\\" film.","true":true}
