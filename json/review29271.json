Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey can\u2019t be capable of half the thing she does without training. Jedis trained for decades before doing what she is doing. It makes the disney installment disrespect Lucas Films past work. Also\\, what a waste of an opportunity to have Luke Skywalker\\, arguably the greatest protagonist in American Cinema history\\, go out like that. A multi billion dollar franchise that\u2019s basis of greatness is a good lightsaber battle and Disney couldn\u2019t even give Mark Hamill a final duel. The opportunity to send Luke Skywalker into the after life with a legendary duel against Kylo or even maybe defeat Snoak and the opportunity was squandered. A strong first half of the movie became forgotten by a dreadful second half. Fin and Rose could basically be cut out of the entire movie and the ending would basically be the same. Everything they did had no effect on the movie at all. Pointless filler. 2\/5 with Chewy single handedly earning a star on his own and Po and B.B. earning the other. ","true":true}
