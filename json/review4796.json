Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely unpredictable which is refreshing for a Star Wars film. Did not expect the multiple plot twists throughout and the surprises over the course of the film. Now we know where blue milk comes from! Even though it's the longest film in the franchise\\, it doesn't feel like it and there isn't any unwanted fluff that doesn't carry the story along.","true":true}
