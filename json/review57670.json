Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trashed Luke Skywalker and any semblance of a good movie. Save your money.\\n\\nHorrible for many reasons...\\n1. Luke actually says \\\"laser swords\\\" instead of light saber \\n2. Lei can fly in deep space despite never being trained in the force \\n3. Space gravity-why do bombers have to fly over the dreadnought?\\n4. 9 movies until someone decided to weaponize light speed-purple hair General is only one that can figure that out...why all the fuss about the Death Stars or star destroyers? Idiots. \\n5. Luke was a hologram in the boss battle so there are actually no scenes of Jedi to Jedi light saber fighting...unless you count Rey somehow holding off Luke with zero training\\n6. Any scene with Rose. No. No. No. Why is she more developed than Snoke?\\n7. All the scenes with the SJW anti-capitalism casino planet vegans freeing the space cows...\\n8. Luke goes from the one hero to a hermit and leaves a map so he can be found but doesn't want to be found...\\n9. Luke drinks space milk from a space cow\\n10. Running out of light speed fuel is now a plot device \\n11. Yoda Ghost can strike things with lightening from the sky\\n12. The huge ships in space travel slower than smaller ships because they are heavier in space...gravity.\\n\\nMovie looks good in terms of special effects\\, but if you expect anything resembling the previous Star Wars universe then skip this disaster.","true":true}
