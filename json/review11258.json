Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly still deciding how I feel about this film. It turns a LOT of Star Wars conventions on their head. Sometimes that's really good (The Rey\/Kylo long distance chats). Sometimes that's not so good (Mary Poppins Leia). The question is\\, does the good outweigh the bad? I need to see it again.
