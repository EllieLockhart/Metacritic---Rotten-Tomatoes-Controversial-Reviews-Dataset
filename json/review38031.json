Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars saga remains to be one of the best franchises of all time. The Last Jedi was quite different than the rest of the movies. The director of the movie attempted to do something different. Overall\\, The Last Jedi was an in between of good and bad\\, marking it my second least favorite Star Wars movie.","true":true}
