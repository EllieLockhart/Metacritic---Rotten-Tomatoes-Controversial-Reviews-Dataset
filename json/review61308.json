Which is actually surprising as Naughty Dog is usually the developer with best stories. They created a wonderful story in the Part I. They developed Joel and Ellie characters bit by bit. And what did they do in the Part II? They immediately killed one of the beloved characters\\, they force you to play for the killer of that character - Abby. We forced to play as Abby without any knowledge about her and\\, honestly\\, her character development is by any means weak. In the end I left with the feeling that they wanted to end the story with Ellie and Dina \\\"happily ever after\\\"\\, but understood that they have f**ked it up and made a kind of continuation in Santa Barbara. So all in all I'm very disappointed in the story. I expected much better from Naughty Dog studio.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
