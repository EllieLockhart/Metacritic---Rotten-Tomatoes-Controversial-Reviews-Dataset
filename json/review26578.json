Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my... what an incredible disappointment on so many levels.  Been a fan since 1977.   I thought TFA was okay\\, but now it seems that Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy are more concerned with promoting social justice and feminism than story\\, plot and character development.  The 5 star reviews here must work for Disney.  Rogue One was a much better film.","true":true}
