Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a fan since 1977. In a way\\, I wish this movie was never made. Not only does it completely disregard much of the Force Awakens\\, but it also disregards EVERYTHING ELSE in this universe that came before it. Where are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke? Why has everyone asked who Rey is if she's nobody? Why didn't Finn and Rose free the kids too? Why is Rey so powerful? Why make Luke a broken\\, defeated guy who is bearly affected by learning his best friend was murdered? Why then kill him off in such a blase fashion? Mind you\\, the astral projection of Luke was a great idea\\, it was just done terribly. Why kill him that way? There are awesome scenes\\, but all in all\\, the plot is ridiculous\\, thew writing needed major revision\\, the treatment of Luke is shameful\\, and the Leia force scene\\, although I loved the idea\\, was shot as if my 5-year old wrote it. Rian Johnson and his Disney overlords have failed this trilogy much the same way Luke failed Ben Solo. This was obvious\\, successful attempt to destroy everything that people like about Star Wars.","true":true}
