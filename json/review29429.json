Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian johnson for his pleasure\\, chose the least pleasant way for any fan of the SAGA for this disappointing sequel in all points of view except cinematography. The arc of the characters makes no sense and brings nothing more to their journey.The worst episode without a doubt.","true":true}
