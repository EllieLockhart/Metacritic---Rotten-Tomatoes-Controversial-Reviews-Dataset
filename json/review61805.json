We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"And once again the paid off shill game journalist and devs are in full damage control trying to shape the narrative. Sorry but if you in your right mind give this glorified MOVIE a 10\/10 you need your head checked. Lets not even get into how bad the story is compared to the first (the first few hours is literally spent watching a dating rom com) or how the game completely and pointlessly **** on a beloved character or the lackluster ending. No lets forget all that for a minute. It's just NOT a fun game to play\\, at all. It's a glorified interactive movie. Listen Druckmann\\, get you a deal with Netflix\\, and make a full fledged tv show\/film it's clearly what you really want to do. It seems like the more advanced consoles are becoming\\, the less games are being games. If this is what PS5 has to offer\\, all the games just being walking simulators\\, then my hype has died down a bit. Find a new formula Sony. Every game being a movie is getting tiresome and old. I don't even feel I need to even talk about the plot\\, it's not even worthy of mentioning. I will just go on pretending this game never happened\\, erasing from my memory and only considering the original canon. Way to take a solid game\\, and completely **** on it's legacy. 10 years from now we could have all looked back at the original TLOU as a great quality game. Now everytime people look back\\, they will just remember how trash it's sequel was\\, great job Naughty Dog. Can't say i'm surprised though. ND first started dropping the ball with Uncharted 4\\, then it's spinoff. I guess we should have expected this. The only reason i'm even giving this game a 4 is because of it's good animations. THAT atleast was great. Way to go ND\\, you did all this crunch overworking employees to release a terrible product\u2026 Expand","true":true}
