Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this movie! It featured great performances from everyone involved and the cinematography\\, score and writing were on par with the Original Trilogy and it had the heart and weight. People complain about Snoke's lack of backstory but in Return of the Jedi\\, the Emperor didn't get a backstory and no one lost their minds then. Ignore the Audience Score\\, this is a great movie and I look forward to happened next a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away!","true":true}
