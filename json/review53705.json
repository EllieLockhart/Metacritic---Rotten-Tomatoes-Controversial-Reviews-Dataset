Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Funny\\, sad\\, exhilarating\\, serene\\, The Last Jedi covers all of the required emotional highs and lows. The story immediately seems to pull a Force Awakens by appearing to be a retread of the second original trilogy film\\, The Empire Strikes Back. Fortunately it quickly evolves into a different type of beast developing into a chase movie of sorts\\, with the requisite race against time to save the day.  A story that keeps you guessing and leaves you wondering who's side anyone is on\\, The Last Jedi is a surprisingly intelligent film that balances an exploration of loss and coming to terms with it\\, against humour\\, cute kid-friendly critters and stand out set pieces\\, with some memorable visuals. Great performances from the old hands\\, Andy Serkis\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in particular which will make her absence from the follow-up even harder to bear.  Daisy Ridley carries her scenes as a more mature Rey looking for answers to her past and future role. A few bizarre scenes aside and some inexplicably reduced screen time for some key Force Awakens characters\\, this is a consistently enjoyable watch that is an improvement on the trilogy opener.","true":true}
