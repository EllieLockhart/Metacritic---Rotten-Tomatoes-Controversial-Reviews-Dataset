Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson have done what the prequels could not. With one movie\\, they have destroyed the true Star Wars saga. This pathetic excuse for a film had potential\\, and all of that blew out of an airlock\\, and flew back in our faces like 'Mary Poppins'! TLJ is stuffed to the gills with\\, not so subtle\\, commentary on today's social climate\\, feminism\\, and liberal narratives. It is quite apparent that Kathleen Kennedy is using Star Wars as a Soap Box platform to 'FORCE' her own political and personal belief systems in our faces\\, and her girly boy lackey\\, Rian Johnson\\, was more that happy to comply with her will. So\\, say goodbye to the Star Wars you all know and love\\, and prepare your selves for a 2 1\/2 hour SJW\/PC\/Liberal\/Trump Hating\/White Male Bashing experience. R.I.P. Star Wars","true":true}
