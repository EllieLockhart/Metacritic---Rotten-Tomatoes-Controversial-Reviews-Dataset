Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like most of the new Star Wars films do\\, this film feels like a cash grab. Personally I don't think Disney understand Star Wars. Thought the sequel trilogy they've wasted characters with plenty of potential such as Finn (FN2187) who originally I thought was going to be the \u2018Jedi' of the trilogy. I think in the past couple Star Wars films they've overused female leads.\\n\\nWhile this film was fun to watch in cinema the more I look back on it the more I see the Floors. For example the throne room scene. In the scene weapons appear out of no where and they guards do unnecessary twirls and moves. And don't forget the scene when Princess Leia uses \u2018Force Powers' to return back to her ship.\\n\\nI love Star Wars and it has became part of our culture the floors of this film is all down To bad directing and writing choices rather than the acting .","true":true}
