{"101487":195171,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a let down\\, i went in with no feelings toward the movie and it still was a huuuuuuuge let down\\, not just a let down just a terrible star wars film\\, i might even say worse then phantom mence. Tons of \\\"twists\\\" that r jusy stuiped.  Some new characters who im not saying r bad actors\\, but just werent fun or needed or wanted\\, they brought nothing to the plot or movie or franchise\\, just a \\\"care about me!\\\"feel. This movie even got me to not care what happened to any of the old cast. So many scenes that were a waste of time and theres even one plot that makes them go to a planet that doesnt feel like star wars at all. The cloths\\, the aliens\\, etc everyone on that planet about felt like from a different movie. I could go on and on and on about why i dont like this\\, but then i would be just rambling on like this movie did. So go see it\\, u have to any way to see the next one. But wow was this bad. (One last thing i like almost all the films\\, i even like force awakens\\, but this one just angers me so.much\\, if u like it thats totally fine\\, i hope it was as good for you as i hoped it would of been for me)","true":true}
