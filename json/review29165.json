Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Recycled scenes from empire and jedi\\, a useless subplot involving useless characters rose and fin\\, an insulting end to Luke's story and wacky SJW  and animal rights nonsense that doesn't belong in star wars.  For one second I thought Rey might actually join with kylo  and actually make things interesting and new.  I have no desire to see episode 9.","true":true}
