Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much tasteless humor and a with a combo of overly pushed merchandise.I think the North Koreans secretly made this movie to ruin the Wests most valuable franchise. In the end I am no longer a Star Wars fan. Thanks Disney <\/3","true":true}
