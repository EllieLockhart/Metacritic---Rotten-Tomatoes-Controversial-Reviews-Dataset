Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look...\\n\\nIt wasn't the best Star Wars movie that has ever been made. It had its flaws and it took some things that many people loved and turned it into something else.\\n\\nBut let's consider this for a moment - Rian Johnson isn't trying to destroy a franchise that has become one of the most powerful franchises in history. He is simply trying to tell a story that is full of emotion\\, both powerful and real. So much of what this movie is saying is so real about the world we live in today. The deep emotional connections that the characters had really had me thinking about what I can include in my own stories as an aspiring artist. The end left me with so many questions that I cannot wait to see the next one. I'm excited to see where the Kylo and Rey relationship goes. I'm excited to see how Mark Hamill contributes to the next film. I'm excited to see the development of Rose. I'm excited to see Finn continue his growth and understanding of the world. This movie left a lot of things for me and for everyone to be excited about.\\n\\nAnd beyond simple story\\, this movie was unbelievably gorgeous. The cinematography was award-worthy\\, and the effects were beautiful. The worlds that were created\\, the red sand flying off the salt planet\\, the hills on the island\\, even the two suns going down as Luke passes on. This movie was a gift to witness.\\n\\nNot everyone is going to be able to walk out of this movie with their checklist completed. But one thing this movie did leave was something for us to be excited about in 2019\\, and I think many people who are rating this movie poorly are forgetting that much of the story has been left to be resolved when episode nine comes out. \\n\\nSimply because this movie was not what you wanted it to be does not give you the right to attack Rian Johnson\\, attack any of the actors or crew members\\, or attack anyone who may have actually enjoyed the film\\, like me. These people were simply creating a piece of art from their own imaginations\\, and that does not give a single person the right to threaten them\\, insult them\\, or tell them to take their own life. It's truly disgusting that we live in a world where civilized criticism is so rare\\, and people feel the need to get on their hands and knees and pray for a great filmmaker to die simply because he didn't create the Star Wars movie of your dreams.\\nI really hope that people can begin to understand how wrong it is to do this to someone\\, and that hopefully as weeks go on\\, people will begin to understand that this movie is not a piece of garbage. Having a movie that doesn't adhere to your own personal needs does not make it an obscenity.\\n\\nI can't wait for episode nine\\, and I hope that people around the world will come to their senses and leave these wonderful artists alone.","true":true}
