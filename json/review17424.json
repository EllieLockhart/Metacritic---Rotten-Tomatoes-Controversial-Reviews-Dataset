Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this has-dropping film the very day it premiered and it didn't upset. This film left me conflicted but in a good way. To an Johnson has directed a clever film that had me happy\\, sad\\, upset and hopeful. I truly enjoyed this film and I cannot wait for the next installment in the saga!","true":true}
