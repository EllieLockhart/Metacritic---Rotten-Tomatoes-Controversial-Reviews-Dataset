Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wait\\, is this is the wrong movie.  I'm looking for the \\\"SJW Wars\\\"..........  Huge Star Wars fan but this is movie was absolute garbage.  It completely destroyed the legacy left by George Lucas.  The six movies made by Lucas are rendered irrelevant by the Last Jedi.  The lore has been shattered.  At times I thought I was seeing a Mel Brooks spoof \\\"Feminists in Space\\\".  Every male character is an idiot.  Every female character is wonder woman.  The leftist agenda is strong in disney star wars.  And besides all those pleasant elements\\, the plot is garbage\\, there is no story  And all intrigue has been eliminated.  I have no interest in the remaining characters.  I don't care what happens in episode 9.  For all I care both sides can blow one another up.  Please do and then sell the franchise back to George Lucas so he can redo this trilogy.  I won't be watching any\\,ore disney star wars\\, or rather sjw wars.","true":true}
