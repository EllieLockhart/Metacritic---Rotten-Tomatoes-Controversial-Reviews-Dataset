Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great performances from Mark Hamill\\, Adam Driver & Daisy Ridley highlight this film for me together with the unique take of Rian Johnson's storytelling. His visual style is pretty amazing too.\\nOkay\\, maybe I didn't love everything about it... the humor was slightly overdone in places for my tastes\\, and there was probably more plot events than this movie really needed. The casino planet stuff didn't totally land for me for one\\, for one.\\n\\nBut I also really enjoyed that it felt like a new story that didn't depend only nostalgia for most of its key plot points. *And* there are four or five scenes in this movie that are so jaw-droppingly assured\\, surprising and original that I couldn't quite believe they were in a Star Wars film.\\n\\nIn comparison\\, this was probably somewhat better than Force Awakens for me\\, but not as quite good as Rogue One.","true":true}
