Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has some fantastic moments that are ruined by unnecessary comedy which falls flat on its face. Finns story line is overlong and could be cut down to reduce the lengthy length of the film. Luke\\, Leia\\, Rey and Kylo are all managed quite well though and there are some fantastic action set pieces that are very entertaining. If you aren't a major Star Wars fan then it's a decent film but if you are then you'll probably be disappointed. Subplots from The Force Awakens are completely dropped here with no mentions at all.  There are also several plot holes that could be mentioned throughout the film.\\nI would say better than the prequels but nowhere as good as the Original Trilogy\\, The Force Awakens or Rogue One. I would give it a 6\/10 for my first viewing.","true":true}
