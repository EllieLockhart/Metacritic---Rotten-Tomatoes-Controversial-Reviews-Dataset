Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much different from previous films. Loved that they went a completely different way than everyone expected. Better than Force Awakens. It was long but I kept wanting it to keep going because I couldn't get enough.","true":true}
