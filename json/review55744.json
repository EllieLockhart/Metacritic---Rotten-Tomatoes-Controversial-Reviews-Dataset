Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I thought that Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an enjoyable movie. I was highly entertained and can honestly say I liked it a lot. I will say though that some of the plot that I felt like needed an answer from the The Force Awakens was tossed out as if it never had a role in the movies to begin with. Also this particular episode seemed to be even more lighthearted and cheesy which isn't always a good thing. Overal great movie. Excited to see where they take it next!","true":true}
