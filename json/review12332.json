Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am split. This film is one part amazing and another part foreign. When I say foreign I mean this film doesn't feel like a Star Wars film at all in parts. I do like Rian Johnson's ambitious ideas\\, and I cant wait to see him take on his own trilogy.","true":true}
