Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deep cuts\\, B-side ballads\\, and heady word tonics await...  This film has bones\\, legs:  can you dig?  Not for superficial fair-weather fans.  Not for bubble gum pop\\, semi-literate neophytes or plebeians.  Go read a book.  This film is what I was waiting for.  Rock on!","true":true}
