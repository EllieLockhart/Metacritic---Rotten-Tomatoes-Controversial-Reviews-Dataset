The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I would like to just let you all know\\, those bad reviews written on June 19th when the game was just released and players probably only played 2 hours of the game should be totally ignored.\r\rI have finished the game and I can say\\, with confidence\\, that this game is a masterpiece. Yes it has a lot of moments in the story we would have liked not happening\\, but let's face it\\, the world of TLOU is cruel\\, is dark and it's realistic.\r\rEllie makes weird decisions that can be seen as unnecessary or dramatics\\, but I honestly think\\, placing ourselves on her shoes\\, this girl has gone through hell and back. She has lost her friends and family and was born on this crazy world filled with monsters and people killing people to survive. She is hurt\\, she is traumatized and we can see this towards the end of the game.\r\rWe don't deserve Ellie. She is strong\\, she is the embodiment of lost and suffering\\, and still she is a fun charismatic character in the story. She is seeking revenge\\, and it's valid\\, she was angry with Joel for something totally unnecessary\\, she lost him without being able to fix their issues. She feels committed to seek revenge because of this. It makes sense.\r\rAbby\\, her back story\\, it's so raw. Ellie takes away from her\\, basically everything doesn't she? Is her reason to kill Joel valid? YES! He did not only kill her Father\\, he took the chance of a cure away from humanity! Do we support Joel's decision on saving Ellie on the first game? We did\\, but just like Abby tells her Father\\, if it was her she would have liked him to sacrifice her to save humanity\\, and Ellie feels the same doesn't she?\rAbby is such a strong and interesting character\\, she has lost her father\\, the man she loves who got another girl pregnant and still she is there. She has a heart\\, she saves Lev and Yara and forgives Ellie's life\\, even after they almost kill each other and Ellie has taken everything away from her. I respect her 100%. I must say\\, I didn't want to like her\\, but I ended up really understanding her and her motives.\r\rThe game itself it's to play\\, the story\\, its darkness\\, facing decision you must make (having to fight against Ellie had me tearing up) but this is the story this characters are living in. What's bad? The game can be exhausting. You feel like it's going to end and it keeps going. After playing with Ellie on the farm\\, you believe it's all over and the game just keep going.\r\rThe gameplay\\, it's pretty much the same as the one on the first game\\, of course new abilities are added given character's size and strength. But overall you do feel familiarity and continuity with the first game.\r\rOverall\\, I loved this game\\, it's so worth playing\\, it's too long but you love it. I recommend it 100% and I am thankful with the amount of work Naughty Dog invested on this masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
