Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has a lot of holes in the plot. Script is boring\\, and written for small children\\, not for adult people. How is it possiple\\, any one accepted\\, so stupid story. The Story is a problem\\, not treating characters\\, for me","true":true}
