Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very disappointing movie\\, The Last Jedi suffers from way too many subplots\\, plot holes\\, and unneeded throwaway characters. Possibly the worst thing about this movie is the Rose\/Finn subplot\\, which has the worst romance and most uneeded character in the franchise (even worse than Anakin and Padme\\, Rose (even Jar Jar was there to provide some comical relief for the children)\\, and is way too preachy about rich people and animal abuse. Other negative things are out of place and forced comedy\\,  Luke's horribly written character\\, Captain Phasma somehow coming back from the dead\\, General Snoke turning out to be a nobody\\, among many other things. It isn't all bad\\, however\\, the soundtrack and action being high points of the movie. Although I somewhat liked it on my first watch\\, I realized how flawed it was my second viewing\\, it now being my least favorite Star Wars movie.","true":true}
