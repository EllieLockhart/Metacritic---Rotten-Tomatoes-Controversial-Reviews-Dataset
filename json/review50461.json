Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"0 main plot sense. All side plots that made no sense. Some enjoyable parts\\, but this movie felt like a betrayal to this series\\, for the sake of being different.","true":true}
