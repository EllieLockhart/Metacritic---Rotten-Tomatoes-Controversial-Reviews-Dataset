Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruins all the cool stuff JJ set up in TFA. Like Rey's mysterious parents\\, and the crazy powerful ancient Snoke. Both those mysteries turn out to be nothing in this film. They didn't even have a real lightsaber fight. For a saga film\\, that's a first. They missed an opportunity to do something really special with the return of Luke Skywalker. Fuck Rian Johnson. I'm now worried about what he's gonna do with his own trilogy.","true":true}
