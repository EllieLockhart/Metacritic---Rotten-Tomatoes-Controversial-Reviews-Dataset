Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a messy retelling of Empire\\, full of plot holes and devoid of joy.\\nI loved Episode 7 and wanted to love this as well.\\nPlot: \\\"A Jedi trainee heads to an unknown planet to train with a master  while the other good guys must escape the bad guys with more powerful ships. A key battle in the movie involves walkers assaulting the good guys' base\\, but luckily the heroes escape on the Falcon.\\\" Am I talking about Empire or The Last Jedi?\\nAs a Star Wars fan I hate how Luke and other key facets were torn down just to be different.\\nAs a movie fan\\, I hate the plot holes like wondering why the First Order didn't simply cut off the escaping Resistance ships by double-jumping or calling in other ships. Instead\\, they did nothing and hoped that everything would work out in the end.\\nAs a storytelling fan\\, I want to tell the writers \\\"Show\\, don't tell.\\\" Everybody who was said to be great was incompetent (Luke\\, Snoke\\, Kylo\\, Hux and the First Order in general\\, Holdo\\, etc.)\\nThis movie was a great disappointment.","true":true}
