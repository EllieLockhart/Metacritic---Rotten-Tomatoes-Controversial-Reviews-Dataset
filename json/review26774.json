Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On 1\/20 an estimated 35\\,000 ISIS fighters held approximately 17\\,500 square miles of territory. As of 12\/21\\, the U.S. military estimates the remaining 1\\,000 or so ISIS fighters occupy roughly 1\\,900 square miles.  Even ISIS is doing better than the SW rebels!!!  Even ISIS.  Can't put social justice warriors in charge of your military folks.  Doesn't work.  Doesn't work.","true":true}
