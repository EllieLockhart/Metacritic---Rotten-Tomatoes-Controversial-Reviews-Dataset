Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The WORST Star Wars movie I have EVER SEEN\\, and I've seen all of the Star Wars movies\\, I would rather watch Jar Jar Binks be an idiot for 10 hours straight than watch this movie.","true":true}
