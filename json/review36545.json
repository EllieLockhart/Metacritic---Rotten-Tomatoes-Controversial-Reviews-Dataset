Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie gives me some surprises\\, like snoke (apparently) dead so easily\\, the attempt to destroy the tracking device turning out to be a failure\\,  the appearance of Yoda\\, no actually laser saber duel in the end\\, etc. The movie brings new elements to Star wars and meanwhile  destory some old as well.\\n\\nBTW\\, I don't think Snoke was really dead. There were 2 to 5 seconds' time in the movie giving to the half body of Snoke after he was killed. I think this implied something.","true":true}
