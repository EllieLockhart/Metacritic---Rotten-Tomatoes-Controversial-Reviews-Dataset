Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson lost the point in this story. It is not a Star Wars movie\\, but also as an stand alone movie\\, the plot is confusing and the characters have been flattened. \\nNice visual effects\\, good actors\\, but is was a very shame that the direction and the story was so bad. A good chance missed! Too bad!","true":true}
