Every bad review I see is from the day this game came out. Everyone played till Joel died and then left a bad review cause their feelings got hurt. What people don't understand is that Joel is not the good guy in last of us. He is a bad person who made bad decisions. Everyone says this game is a revenge plot but its not. Yes\\, it may have started like that but in no way does it end like one. It ends as a forgiveness story.  The story of this game is fantastic and in no way is it bad because Joel dies. I loved Joel as much as the next person but people are acting like he did nothing wrong. Joel's death was coming for him and he knew that. The gameplay of this game is also incredible. the gunplay feels so good and the way this game does scavenging and crafting is great. By no means is this game perfect and there are some parts of this game that drag on but overall this game is a 10\/10 and people need to stop hating on it because their favorite character dies.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
