Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any hope that fans had for the new trilogy to redeem the franchise has now vanished to a galaxy far\\, far\\, away. Disney execs have no problem paying off critics and pandering to the stupidest and most self-adulating elements of modern American culture in order to sell merchandise and fatten their bank accounts. Star Wars has been turned into a steaming pile of turd\\, and I do not plan on seeing any more SW movies Disney comes out with in theaters.","true":true}
