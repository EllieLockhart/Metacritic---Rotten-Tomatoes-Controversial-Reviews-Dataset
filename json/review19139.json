Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's insulting that Disney allowed this film to be released. It's amazing that the script was ever green lit in the first place but\\, even after it was\\, upon watching the final edit it should have been unanimously decided to never release it to the public and to start again. This film is terrible from start to finish.","true":true}
