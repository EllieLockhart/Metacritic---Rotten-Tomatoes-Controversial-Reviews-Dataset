Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to explain the feelings I have about this movie. So much wrong. Just a little bit right. The main thing I can't forgive is the ruination of the timeline and defamation this film has done to the legacy of Star Wars. Insulted is the best I can come up with.","true":true}
