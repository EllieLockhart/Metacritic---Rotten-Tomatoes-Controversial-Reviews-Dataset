Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was okay but not great.  It was a comedy which was a surprise to me and I suspect pretty much everyone who watched it.  There were a few serious head scratcher moments in it as well which will leave Star Wars fans shaking their heads.  The comedic moments made the movie which would have been terrible otherwise.","true":true}
