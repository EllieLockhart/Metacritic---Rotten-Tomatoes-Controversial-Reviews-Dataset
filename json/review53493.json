Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't understand the hate for this movie. Seems like some people are stuck on the original trilogy and can't get over it. Everyone was so mad a George Lucas horrible prequels and now want him back\\, well you can keep your jar jar and make your own movie. But this movie felt different from all the other movies and glad it did\\, I was disappointed with the force awakens because I felt it was to similar to the episode 4\\, but this movie was all on its own. Don't go by the BOT reviews spreading on the internet due to diversity and the fear of seeing it.","true":true}
