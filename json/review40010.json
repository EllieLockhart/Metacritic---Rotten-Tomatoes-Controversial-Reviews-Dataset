Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just the worst Star Wars movie ever!  \\n\\nThe entire story for this episode and the way characters get written out is a complete disgrace to the Star Wars movies.  This movie is worse than the prequel movies by far.  A lot of characters get written out or at least appear to be written out in the worst way possible.  They not only write out old trilogy characters\\, but also the current trilogy characters with no background or character development in the character before they do.   It was like they didn't care to write a great script for this movie and instead tried to make it some poorly executed moral\/political statement.  Sad excuse of a Star Wars movie. Disney failed harder than Lucas did with the prequels.  So many unanswered questions and a continued feeling throughout the entire movie of disappointment for the direction it is probably going to head.  \\n\\nEssentially the movie was a 2.5 hour chase scene with a side mission that ultimately leads to nothing\\, but a few people dying off.","true":true}
