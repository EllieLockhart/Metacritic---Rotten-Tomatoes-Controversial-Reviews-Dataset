Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks Disney for destroying the franchise. The SJW is strong with this one.  Horrible ass movie that completely destroyed the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Everything he has been through just to die on a rock on an island. Lame!  Too obvious you are killing off all the classic characters in favor of a young SJW diverse universe. Well except the Empire\\, they were all white males. No way in hell I am pre-purchasing Star Wars tickets ever again","true":true}
