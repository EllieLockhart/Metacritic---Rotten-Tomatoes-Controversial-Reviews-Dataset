Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This New trilogy makes Lucas Ep 1-3 look epic.  For a movie to be timeless\\, you must remove present day politics and movie trends\\, general Politics are fine\\, emotional ones are not. For it to be Star Wars Skywalker episode\\, it needs to um.... include the Skywalker Family.  For it to have Jedi's it should have some form of TaiChi philosophy\\, fails here to.  \\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, has NO memorable Quotes\\, with of without Wisdom.  Has hero's that have no passion\\, 10yo Anakin was a stronger character. \\n\\nWhat we have is an Hungry Games Movie\\, with and big idiot then Harry Potter.  PLease note\\, I liked Harry Potter as a wholes\\, but when the Big Bad is after you.... You TRAIN.  You try to Survive.  Quote Patton\\, make the other dumb bastards die.  Every US Marine knows this\\, every solider knows this.  You do not run blindly into the belly of the beast.\\n\\nI had high hope for JJ\\, I liked his Star Trek Movies.  What he has done to SW\\, should be erased.","true":true}
