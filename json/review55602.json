Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO! They really fell off the tracks on this one. Just when you think they are going back to old school special affects\\, minimal CGI\\, and no children jokes\\, they ignore all of that\\, and make a slapstick comedy about a slow speed space chase that doesn't answer anything.  This one was on par with the prequels. The CGI was horribly over used for characters and aliens that were not even needed... prequels style. The story was dry and full of plot holes\\, but they try and trick you into being interested with a few huge fight scenes and explosions. Who is Snoke and what is his purpose!? Apparently he has less of a meaning to the story than admiral Akbar. There were no twists or surprises\\, no character development.. just explosions\\, cartoony aliens\\, and poorly written stories. Bad plot with well done CGI\\, doesnt make a good move.\\n\\nROGUE ONE got it right with authentic special effects\\, subtle humor with serious tones\\, and a well written story that actually explained one of the biggest plot holes ever in heroic style. Why can't they keep doing those?!?","true":true}
