Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did i have fun watching this movie?   Yes. Cause it's Star Wars.  Is this a good movie?  Can't say it is.  Is it a good sequel \/ saga episode.  Hard NO.  Movie chooses to ignore themes and character archs from previous episodes.  The Last Jedi is way too crowded and forces themes and character archs that dont feel relevant or earned.   Additionally there are logic holes throughout the movie that just take the viewer out of the world.  Was excited after The Force Awakens.  I am no longer excited for episode IX.","true":true}
