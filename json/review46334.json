Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it \\\"great?\\\" Nope...\\nWas it better than Episodes 1-3? VERY much so...\\nI definitely feel bad for JJ Abrams\\, his hard work and story he set up was pretty much scraped... but the movie was solid in it's own right. The negative hype will cool... it's a good Star Wars movie\\, plain and simple. We were spoiled with an excellent Rogue One and an Above average Force Awakens... so yes\\, this feels like a disappointment\\, but it's really not.","true":true}
