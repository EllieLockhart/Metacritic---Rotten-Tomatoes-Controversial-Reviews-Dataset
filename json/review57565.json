Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the last Star Wars movie I'll see in the theater. \\n\\nI didn't particularly care for the Force Awakens\\, but after Rogue One I was willing\\, if not eager\\, to give it another shot. Never again.\\n\\nBelieve the fan reviews\\, this was not a good one.","true":true}
