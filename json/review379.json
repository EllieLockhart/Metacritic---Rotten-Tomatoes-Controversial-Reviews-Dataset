You can get some scares during this game. Some are more frightening than others. Sometimes you see them coming and sometimes don't.

If you do\\, you may lose one member of your group. So yes\\, you have always to be ready for everything. It took me about 8 hours and I finished the game with 4 members (3 girls\\, 1 male). I lost 2 members when I was almost finishing the game. In my opinion this game deserve an 8 or 9. Graphics and voices are great and in the extra content you can see the real actors and most of them are almost the same than in the game. Unless you like scary games daylight is a good moment to play this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
