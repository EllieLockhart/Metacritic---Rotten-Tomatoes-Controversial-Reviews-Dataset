{"101487":197048,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why it sucks\\n\\n1.The plot\\n\\nBORING\\n\\n-2.0hr\/2.5hr slow space chase.\\n\\n-running out of fuel\\n\\n-Luke and rey too long on the island\\, nothing noteworthy happens\\n\\n-Finn and asian girl at casino was boring\\n\\n-No lightsaber fight (lightsaber scenes take up decent chunk of trailers\\, but nothing in movie)\\n\\nSTUPID\\, MADE NO SENSE\\n\\n-Why didn't the pink haired lady tell Poe\\, the greatest pilot in the resistance\\, the plan to escape. Better than making him think you have no plan\\, and forcing him to do something rash.\\n\\n-Using lightspeed as a weapon destroys everything for the past star wars movies\\, why shoot proton torpedo\\, instead make 3 big ships\\, kamakezi into death star. Ez. Or better yet\\, why not evacuate one ship\\, then blast the ship into the first order.\\n\\n-why did luke skywalker have a map where he was if he didn't want to be found.\\n\\n-why would luke try and kill ben solo\\, when he risked his life to save darth vader\\, someone far more evil and powerful.\\n\\n-why did luke go to the first jedi temple if he just wanted to be left alone. (if he wanted to destroy the temple\\, why didnt he do it earlier)\\n\\n-Why didn't finn just find a different place to park.\\n\\n-How did leia use the force in deep space after being blasted the fuck out of the ship\\n\\n-Why did the asin girl crash into finn at the end of the movie\\, causing the first order to destroy the gate\\, killing herself\\, and risking doing the same to finn.\\n\\n-Reys parents being a secret then suddenly not being a secret.\\n\\n-What was the point of the cave if rey knew who her parents were\\n\\n-What was the point of Snoke\\n\\n-Where were the Knights of Ren? They weren't hunting down the resistance or protecting snoke\\, so why tf was there purpose in the movie\\, and why were they built up in the last one.\\n\\n-Phasma is a fucking idiot and died like an idiot\\n\\n-Anyone can use the force. No more force sensitive. Everyone can be a jedi!\\n\\n-If Yoda could conjure up a giant lightning storm from the sky\\, why didn't he help luke or rey earlier??\\n\\n-Rey spends a few days on the island with luke whereas the ship chase is less than a day\\, and no context in the movie is given for this.\\n\\n\\n\\n2)The Characters\\n\\n-No main character\\, too many characters\\n\\n-No character arcs\\, except for Poe which is a negative character arc\\n\\n-Characters were boring and dumbed down to one dimension\\, try describing the personalities and attributes of the characters in this movie without saying what they did in the movie\\, or what they look like.\\n\\n-Luke Skywalker completely out of character\\, weak willed old man\\n\\n-Asian girl boring\\, no personality\\, why spend so much time on her just to kill her off.\\n\\n-Finn devolved to bumbling idiot\\n\\n-Poe devolved to hotheaded idiot\\n\\n-Rey even more perfect\\, beating luke fucking skywalker in combat\\, being able to pick up metric tons of boulders with virtually no training.\\n\\n-Snoke does nothing\\, just dies\\, we get no character developement\\, no motivation.\\n\\n-Pink haired lady wooden actor\\n\\n-BB-8 too perfect\\n\\n-General hux does nothing other than complain and stand on a ship\\n\\n-Phasma does nothing\\, no developement. should've combined phasma and hux\\n\\n-Porgs were nothing other than a marketing insertion.\\n\\n-chewie did nothing other than bash a door and copilot.\\n\\n\\n\\n3)Emotion\\n\\n-Too much humor. Good in small amounts\\, but when it interferes with genuine character moments\\, it ruins them. \\n\\n-Humor was maybe funny 20% of the time\\n\\n-slow chase running out of fuel gave no tension\\n\\n-Emotional investment in the wrong places. EG- saving the animals made the casino trip worth it. AKA fuck the rebellion\\, yay animals are free for 2 hours then will get caught again.\\n\\n-Having twists does not make them emotional or good plotwise. EG- luke trying to kill ben\\, Kylo ren killing snoke\\, pink bitch having a plan after all.\\n\\n-Know rey will never die\\, not even a scratch on her\\, no tension.\\n\\n-Why have kylo ren save rey (good twist\\, poor execution) but then turn evil again\\,shouldve stayed good\\, both of them fight and lose to snoke\\, then have luke die saving them both. At the end of the day its just a lazy way to kill off snoke and keeping the characters the same.\\n\\n-The movie makes you hate the resistance and luke for their stupidity\\, and sympathize with kylo ren\\, who is supposed to be the ultimate bad guy now.\\n\\n\\n\\n4)what is there left?\\n\\n-Snoke dead\\, rebellion all but gone. But they have hope\\, yay.....\\n\\n-All OT characters dead\\, no leia in 9\\n\\n-Rey shown to be just as strong if not stronger than kylo. No worries that she will beat him\/convert him to light side in end of  next movie\\n\\n-No major conflicts or plotlines\/ questions left to answer other than who will win; resistance or first order. tough question to answer in the concluding disney movie.\\n\\n\\n\\n5)Stupid messages\\n\\n-Blindly follow authority=poe arc\\n\\n-Animal abuse???\\n\\n-As long as we have love we will win\\n\\n-All men shown as deeply flawed characters\\, women shown as knowledgable and capable.\\n\\n-Learn from failures (good message\\, poorly executed)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6)Closing remarks\/verdict\\n\\n\\n\\nStar Wars 8 is a stupid\\, boring\\, and confusing movie which destroys the legacy of characters from the original trilogy and kills the interesting open ended plots of E7. No desire to see the last movie.","true":true}
