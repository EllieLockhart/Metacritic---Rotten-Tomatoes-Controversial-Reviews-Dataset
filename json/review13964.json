Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you enjoy the heart and soul of Star Wars\\, prepare to have that ripped from your chest by the tried and true Marvel-esque formula being applied to the universe we knew. This takes every character development arc and crushes it for the sake of a cheap thrill. Rian Johnson takes risks where they make little sense\\, fails to continue any semblance of a story\\, and bends the universe until it snaps in half. This wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, it wasn't even a good movie. I feel like as a life-long fan I was politely shown the door\\, as I am no longer the target demographic.","true":true}
