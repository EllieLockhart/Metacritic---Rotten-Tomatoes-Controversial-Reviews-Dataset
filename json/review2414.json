Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very badly written movie with no cohesion  with previous films it is intentionally rewriting the way the in universe powers work in order to make rey as strong as possible. the CGI was very noticeable and did little to hid that they used it for the fight scenes and actors that were dead.","true":true}
