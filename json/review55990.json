Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it with 4 buddies at a IMAX 3D afternoon show (90% full).  Curious hate vs love response by RT audience so far.  I thought the movie was spectacular.  It was epic in scale\\, the CGI and cinematography top notch\\, and the story (the collapsing rebel force and symbolically \\\"last Jedi\\\") was  intriguing.  A few more characters were introduced while familiar ones faded away.  The film appears to be a transition to the next rebel\/Jedi generation.  I've old enough to have seen the 1st movie\\, A New Hope\\, when it came out\\, so I've been invested with the original cast for 40-ish years.  But as the series transitions to a new generation\\, I'm good with that\\, and I'm willing to accect that many familliar faces will disappear. The 3D IMAX looked amazing.  Now\\, there was a few things that seemed controversial among my group.  A couple wished the humor was dialed back a bit\\, there was some concern about the length\\, as well as cute furry things to sell.  I thought it was great.  The others in my group all liked it though not quite as strongly as me. To me\\, the haters so far are overly harsh in their ratings.","true":true}
