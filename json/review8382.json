Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt more like a series of stories than a movie.  Far too many childish and cliques.  Absolute sell out with a black male and Asian female romance or main characters.  Gee\\, haven't seen that before in every fucking movie.  Gets tiring after a while.  Critics got this one wrong again.  The sell out is strong with these critics.","true":true}
