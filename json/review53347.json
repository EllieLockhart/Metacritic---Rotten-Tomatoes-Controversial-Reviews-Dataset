Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite a few pointless scenes with Benico Del Toro\\, Captain Phasma being wasted once again\\, The Forced relationship between Finn and Rose\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a damn good movie. I loved every moment of this film. Rian Johnson really brought his A game with this film and Believe it or not\\, This actually the first Rian Johnson film I have seen. I still need to go watch Looper because I heard that\u2019s amazing. But anyways\\, back to Star Wars. So in the Last Jedi\\, we pick up where we left off ","true":true}
