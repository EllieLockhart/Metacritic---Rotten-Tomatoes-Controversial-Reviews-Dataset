Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a diehard Star Wars fan\\, it made me want to burn all my Star Wars collectibles and paraphernalia. But then I remember that this is all JJ Abrams\\, Disney\\, and Rian Johnson's fault (with help I'm sure) -- i gave the Force Awakens some leeway since it was the first sequential film after the best trilogy ever made\\, but i give it no chances any longer. Ep VII and VIII rank at the bottom of all Star Wars media for me. Attack of the Clones\\, which consensus has as the worst of the 6 films prior to 2015\\, is miles ahead of these two films. This isn't just about a good film\\, a bad film\\, etc. They destroyed a franchise that millions and millions of people idolize and adore. They took on the responsibility of driving this franchise on the right path\\, the best path for fans new and old alike - and sadly\\, they failed us.","true":true}
