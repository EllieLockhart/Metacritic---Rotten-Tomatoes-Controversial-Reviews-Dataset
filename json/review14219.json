Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it 2 stars just for the amazing special effects. But\\, I am extremely disappointed. Half the movie served no purpose.  If  they don't explain everything about Rey and Snoke in episode IX\\, Star Wars will be officially ruined.","true":true}
