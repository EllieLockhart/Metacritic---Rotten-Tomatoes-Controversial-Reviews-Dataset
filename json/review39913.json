Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen.  I feel let down\\, betrayed\\, and disappointed.  There are so many things about this movie that do not feel like Star Wars.  Luke\\, the noble hero in the OT\\, was turned into a bitter old man who tried to murder his nephew (totally not in character).  The way they handled Leia spacewalking back from death...ridiculous.  Luke milking a space alien for breast milk...General Hux was an absolute joke...Killing the only villain that was somewhat intriguing (Snoke)...Rey didn't actually receive any training...The whole chase movie did not even make sense.  Overall I am extremely disappointed and for the first time\\, I am scared and worried about the future of Star Wars.  I didn't even hate the prequels as bad as this.","true":true}
