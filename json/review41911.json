Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is well done\\, well filmed\\, with good actors\\, amazing special effects\\, action scenes\\, and a sub par plot with an ending that will leave you unsatisfied because it is part of a trilogy ; the ending isn't there.\\n\\nThey killed the most interesting characters and left the young ones alive because they pander to the young audience ; Rey and Kylo are our 20 year old ( looking ) pop stars our 12 year olds can admire.\\n\\nKylo Ren was an interesting addition at first\\, but now that our over hyped Snoke is dead\\, without telling us who he was\\, from where he came from\\, or even given enough time to develop what seemed to me like the most amazing character of the movie\\, Kylo is now the head bad guy... And with such an impulsive personality\\, we can now easily deduce how star wars 9 will go down like. The empire will attack\\, Kylo will be baited\\, he will take the bait\\, Rey will defeat him and the good guys will win. Yay. Congratulations to JJ Abrams for writing himself into a corner. \\n\\nEverything else was fine about the movie though. Still worth watching. I rate it 7 on 10\\, because no amount of Disney money can create an intelligent story line.","true":true}
