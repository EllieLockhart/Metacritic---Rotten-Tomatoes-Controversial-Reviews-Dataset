Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler-Free Summary:\\n\\nPros:\\n-exciting battle sequences\\n-interesting new Star Wars vehicle\/vessel designs\\n-certain hyped elements live up to expectations\\n-good character chemistry\\n\\nCons:\\n-lacks that core feeling of being a true Star Wars film\\n-weakest story of any Star Wars film ever\\n-unnecessary inclusion of certain characters from past films\\n-excessive reliance on CG effects\\n-unnecessary or poorly implemented deaths\/endings of characters\\n-underwhelming new set pieces\\n-Porgs\\n\\n\\nFull Review with Spoilers:\\n\\nWhen Disney released The Force Awakens\\, my love for Star Wars was itself reawakened after a long hibernation during the prequel trilogy years. J.J. Abrams gave us a film with intriguing new characters\\, a re-emphasis on traditional puppeteered effects reminiscent of the original trilogy\\, and a story that thoroughly pleased despite rehashing a number of classic Star Wars franchise elements. Heading into The Last Jedi\\, I had high expectations after reading articles both in print and online describing Disney's complete satisfaction with the direction taken by director Rian Johnson. Unlike the turmoil surrounding other Star Wars films such as Rogue One\\, which required considerable reshoots\\, or the Han Solo and Episode IX films\\, where the reins of directorship switched hands\\, it is rumored that Disney plans to give Rian Johnson leadership over a new Star Wars trilogy project in the future. If true\\, this bodes ill for the fate of that galaxy far far away.\\n\\nSuccinctly put\\, The Last Jedi is the worst non-prequel trilogy Star Wars film ever to hit the big screen\\, and in some ways\\, the movie even fails more than those dreaded prequels. Following an exciting\\, physics-defying opening battle\\, the otherwise bland story follows the efforts of the tiny Resistance fleet to flee destruction at the hands of an increasingly emboldened First Order\\, and this tortoise-paced chase fills too much of the 2 1\/2 hour long movie. Finn and newcomer\\, Rose\\, embark on their own side mission to save the fleet\\, and this task takes them to an unremarkable gambling world locale. Throughout the film\\, Star Wars fans are rarely greeted by fascinating new locations added to the canon of the Star Wars galaxy. Luke's island home is just as it appeared at the climax of The Force Awakens with little additional set pieces\\, and Crait\\, the new mining planet seen in most pre-release teaser footage\\, does not receive as much screen time as anticipated. Scenes aboard Resistance and First Order vessels remain limited to a few repeated bridges and hangars.\\n\\nWhile the story disappoints so much so that even the prequel trilogy films with their convoluted galactic politics manage to provide the audience with cohesive and enjoyable plots\\, Episode VIII does offer the quality character chemistry expected of non-prequel trilogy movies. The interaction between Luke Skywalker and Rey [still no known surname] comprise the most memorable parts and deserved far more screen time than was allotted. Meanwhile\\, the inclusion of cameos by Maz Kanata and Spirit Yoda introductions of worthless new characters (Benicio Del Toro's \\\"DJ\\\") wasted time better spent elsewhere filling the audience in on otherwise unexplained story elements (how did Rey suddenly return to the Millennium Falcon for the climactic battle?) or offering a more meaningful death scene to a certain long-time fan-favorite character (hint: it's a trap).\\n\\nIn the end\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi promised to much and managed to deliver so little. Perhaps in subsequent viewings of the film\\, opinions may change\\, but as it stands now amidst the Star Wars saga\\, this film barely holds a place above the prequel trilogy\\, and that ranking decision is cast in much doubt.","true":true}
