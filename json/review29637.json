Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson should rot in hell.  I would give no stars if I could.  He screwed this up on a colossal level.  That is not the Luke Skywalker we all know and love.  Mark Hamil's performance was great.  He is a fine actor.  The story was just stupid.  And don't get me started about the porgs.  There should have been a clause in Disney's contract that if they did something incredibly stupid\\, they would have to return the franchise to George Lucas.  Don't get me wrong\\, it is magical to have a new 2.5 hours in the Star Wars universe.  The fans live for that.  But it all just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.","true":true}
