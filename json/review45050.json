Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelievably disappointed.  JJ left two years of cliff-hanger debates about the origins of Rey.  Rian Johnson not only squandered JJ's work\\, but he destroyed Luke Skywalker.  That's an unforgivable blow of a lifetime.  How could they possibly have given the control of such an epic to this man?  He singlehandedly crushed star wars.  Unbelievable.  Hayden C. must be laughing his ass off - the first three-quils have just been fully redeemed by comparison.  No amount of pretty CGI can wash away the abomination that was this plot.  I feel bad for Mark H.  I feel bad for the other actors who did a really great job.  Adam Driver was really outstanding and played the role as he should have been.  This was squarely a flopper because of the director.   Forget Star Wars 9.  There is no cliff hanger going into the next episode.  Just a train wreck.  Not even the almighty JJ can resurrect after that.","true":true}
