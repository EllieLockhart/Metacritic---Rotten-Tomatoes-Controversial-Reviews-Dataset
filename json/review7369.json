Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Esta pel\u00edcula es una burla para los verdaderos fans de Star Wars\\, con escenas que rompen el sentido de la l\u00f3gica en el universo Star Wars\\, escenas recicladas de la trilog\u00eda original (nuevamente)\\, ridiculizaci\u00f3n de personajes\\, con todo un potencial desperdiciado hacen de esta la peor pel\u00edcula de la saga. En serio no entiendo el 91% en el Tomat\u00f3metro.","true":false}
