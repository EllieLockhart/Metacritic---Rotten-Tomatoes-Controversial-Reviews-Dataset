Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi tramples on any last hope I had that Disney would honor the legacy of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. At this point it's clear the the sequel trilogy is not a good faith attempt at providing quality new Star Wars stories\\, but rather a focus group tested film looking to drive maximum revenue to Disney's Star Wars theme parks and merchandising. \\n\\nDisney wiped out 30 years of canon from the Expanded Universe and gave us drivel instead.  This film makes a mockery of any sense of weightiness or continuity in what is supposed to be a vast universe. There were so many interesting stories they could have used from the EU like the Heir to the Empire trilogy\\, the New Jedi Order\\, or Legacy of the Force (Kylo Ren is a poor imitation of Jacen Solo).  Instead they discarded years of beloved stories to give us nonsensical garbage. \\n\\nSomeone at Disney seems to have taken to seriously the criticism of the prequels that said it was to heavy on galactic politics\\, and this nonsense is the hard over correction we have received. I personally loved the scenes in the Galactic Senate\\, and discussions of what drove the Galaxy into the Clone Wars from the prequels\\, those movies were done in by poor dialogue amongst the critical characters. You can fault George Lucas for that\\, but they certainly shouldn't disregard the man's vision of a galaxy far far away in favor of a Disneyified pile of crap. Lucas gave us an exceptional story set in a rich and contextualized universe that was fleshed out through stories written over the course of a generation\\, Disney has given us a banal rehash of those same stories with none of the riveting world building that accompanied the originals. \\n\\nStar Wars is not a superhero movie. The movies are tectonic events in a universe that is a vast and varied as our own. There is limitless potential for amazing stories\\, look to the work that Bioware did in Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars the Old Republic to see what it would be like to create original galaxy spanning Star Wars stories. \\n\\nThere are so many ways Disney could have done this right\\, but by first eliminating the EU entirely and then green lighting a trilogy that is as incomprehensible as I'm sure this stream of consciousness review will be to any readers\\, they've done a grave disservice to a generation of fans of the most beloved Science Fiction series of all time\\, and its a blow I fear it will never recover from.","true":true}
