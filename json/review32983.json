Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story structure makes little sense. Not internally consistent. Pseudo-starts \\\"themes\\\" and never adequately explores them.  Every joke undercuts the movie and too many of them are \\\"HEY GUYS REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS?\\\". Some of the scenes are pretty but with a weird new amount of strange animals now that Disney is in charge.","true":true}
