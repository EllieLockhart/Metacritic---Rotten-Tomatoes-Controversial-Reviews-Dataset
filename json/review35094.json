Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I watched this movie I was confused and disappointed. I tried to watch this movie a second time \\, but everything that was bad the first time was still just as bad. I really wanted to like this movie.","true":true}
