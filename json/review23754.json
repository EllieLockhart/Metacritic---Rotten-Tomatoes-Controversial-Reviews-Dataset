Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker is the definition of a new hope\\, he shouldn't be a hermit on an island and he should also see the good in Kyle Ren at the end. They try to make Poe seem like a stupid man after trying to save the entire resistance because he didn't know about a secret plan that nobody would tell him. Finn was about to save everybody and Rose stops him unknowing that Luke and Rey would clean up after her. Also Finn got completely ignored. Plot goes nowhere\\, the movie starts with them running from the first order and it ends with them running from the first order except this time with like 10 people left in the resistance but they still see it as a victory and a happy ending","true":true}
