Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very very bad movie before being a SW abomination.. Joke joke\\, subversion and subversion\\, that's all.. Every SW FA just destroyed and a movie full of plot holes and stupidity..\\n\\nI would pay to unsee it..","true":true}
