Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brazilian Star Wars ex-fan here. Funny thing\\, I watched all Star Wars with my father\\, and dreamed long before i had my own son about watching Star Wars with him. \\n\\n When my son was born by one of those mysteries of genetics he was born 100% White\\, despite the fact that his mother is a mix between Blacks\\, indigenous and whites\\, and that is the only white kid on her side of the family. How can i explain to my 3 years old kid that he should be proud of himself and of ALL of his heritage while in every shit SJW movie released a white man can be nothing other than the villain since for his bad luck he isn't the son of some privileged Hollywood son of bitch screenwriter? He had the bad luck of being born the son of a worker. The very kind that hollywood bastards thinks that don't exist.","true":true}
