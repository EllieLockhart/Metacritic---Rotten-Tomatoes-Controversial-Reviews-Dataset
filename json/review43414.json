Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was another great installment in the Stars Saga. Don\u2019t be thrown off by all the negatives. It is just a group of people who are angry with the new way Disney is taking the story. They are just bombing the movie with hundreds of negative reviews and calling for a boycott. Don\u2019t listen to them! Go see it\\, it\u2019s well worth it.","true":true}
