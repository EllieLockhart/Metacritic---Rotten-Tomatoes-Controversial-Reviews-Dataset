Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Original Trilogy fans will quickly find out this movie marks the end of the George Lucas\/original cast & crew era along with the beginning of the Disney blitzkrieg on marketing\\, theme parks\\, and new characters\\, stories and films to add to their coffers. \\n\\nThank you\\, Disney\\, for communicating to me through this \\\"Star Wars\\\" film that the sell off of Original Trilogy characters is complete and I am no longer needed to attend any future \\\"Star Wars\\\" films that your company delivers. Give yourselves a round of pats on the back\\, Disney executive officers. You dodged a few million in royalties due to George Lucas by throwing his original characters in a ditch.\\n  \\nAlso\\, thank you for hiring a 40+ year old man-child named Rian Johnson to haze\\, deceive\\, and harass Mark Hamill and who knows who else throughout the making of TLJ. I'll be sure to avoid Mr. Johnson's future \\\"Star Wars\\\" trilogy and any other movies he makes as long as I live as well. Of course this applies to any Disney brand that we may have otherwise paid to enjoy in the future as well. Walt Disney would be disgusted with your greedy transformation and perversion of his company. \\n\\nThe others in my household feel the same way and now know we are not wanted at any future \\\"Star Wars\\\" Disney theme park(s) either. \\n\\nBest wishes with your youth indoctrination programs in the future\\, but we think that time will tell that turning the corporate back on the fans that financed the value in the saga you purchased from George Lucas was a damning mistake.","true":true}
