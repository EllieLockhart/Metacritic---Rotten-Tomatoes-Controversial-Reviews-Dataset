We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I spent a good amount of time and effort avoiding spoilers\\, I figured it was all being blown out of proportion and there was no way a game as good as TLOU would get a sequel that was anywhere near as bad as everyone was claiming. I was warned by more than one friend not to spend the money but I did and now I understand the hate.  I went into it knowing that Joel doesn't survive and I  kinda understood that decision\\, he was getting older and  honestly he wouldn't be capable of the level of fighting and action it would take to survive the hostile landscape they exist in.  I expected him to go out in a cliche but respectful way\\, saving Ellie or Tommy (his only family) but the choice they made here just pisses in the face of all the emotion and connection players developed over the course of the first game. I assume a lot of people did what I did and replayed the first game recently to refresh all the info\\, so these emotions were in full force. The fact that  NaughtyDog was willing to treat his character with that level of hate and disregard shows how little they care about anything other than making money by pushing whatever agenda is hot.\r\rThere are so many other ways they could have told this same story that would have been amazing\\, instead they chose a way that has established characters doing things that go completely opposite of their personalities and instead of figuring out a way to make us feel some sort of compassion for Abby you take the easy way out and force us to play as her for 10 hours and just hope we care enough at the end to overlook the insane choice Ellie makes by not killing Abby because woman beating in man's head with golf club\\, good but woman killing woman who took almost everything she cared about\\, including her fingers\\, bad.\r\rThe game has positives\\, when I first started it I was blown away by the visuals\\, they're breathtaking. The game play is good and everything seemed polished with none of the glitches or issues that seem to be present in most AAA titles lately.  The only problem is the story and there is nothing that can save a story this bad.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
