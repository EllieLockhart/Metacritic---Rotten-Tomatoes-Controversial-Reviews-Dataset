Such a risk taken by Naughty Dog in terms of narration! I feel like the ambition to create more than a game but rather an emotional experience completely explains why the reviews are so divisive today.\rIt must be quite complex to try and decipher the human mind in order to engineer such a journey.

I'm still collecting my thoughts several days after finishing the game.\rIn its own way (and unprecedented in the medium I feel) it is a masterpiece in what it tries to achieve. It just isn't the game everyone was waiting for.\r\rI give it a 9 mainly due to some downtimes in the storyline. Graphics\\, animations\\, music and emotional parts are top notch. I also found the game-play a lot more interesting and rewarding compared to the first opus.\r\rIn a nutshell\\, as a piece of art this game is absolutely unique. As a game it is quite fun even though a bit long at times. As a story\\, it is definitely one to remember.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
