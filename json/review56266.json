Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Just from the color red being presented throughout the film and the posters\\, I KNEW this film was gonna have SOMETHING different. I've rewatched this 2 1\/2 hour film about 6 to 7 times now...and I STILL enjoy this movie. It's not a masterpiece\\, but it's an undeniably fun\\, daring\\, ambitious\\, bold\\, grim\\, mature\\, & truly nuanced film that still provokes your thoughts up until the last frame. My biggest issue with this film is that there's a storyline between Finn & this new character Rose in which I thought the film kinda took a detour. The whole Canto Bight was a little unnecessary at times. But\\, nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed everything else surrounding the film. The chemistry between Luke & Rey\\, the brilliant character arc of Poe\\, the deep torment of Kylo Ren\\, the shocking plot twists\\, the shining light that was put upon Carrie Fisher as Leia\\, and the overall visual flair of the film made it one of the most unique films in the franchise. I love the fact that the camerawork for the fight scenes felt like how the old school kung fu\/samurai films looked. It was so cool. I do understand why people DESPISE this film\\, but I'm not gonna let them change my opinion. I DO still enjoy watching this film and I respect the direction that Rian Johnson took with the entire franchise.","true":true}
