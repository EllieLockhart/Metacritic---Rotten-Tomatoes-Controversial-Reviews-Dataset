Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 25% of it that was Star Wars was good.  the 75% of it that was Disney not so much.  Horrible plot with massive plot holes\\, an excursion that has no bearing on the rest of the story\\, characters acting completely differently than they have been established because \\\"why not\\\" and this is a long overly drawn out slog fest.  I saw it opening day to avoid spoilers\\, but with its constant fan-service this is Netflix quality at best.","true":true}
