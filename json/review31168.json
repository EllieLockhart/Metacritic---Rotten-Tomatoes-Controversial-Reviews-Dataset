Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many issues. Plot was haphazard and messy and many of the plot threads proved to be insignificant or had no impact on the overall story. None of the questions raised in the Force Awakens or books and comics were really answered. Who was Snoke? Where did he come from? Where is Thrawn\\, Rae Sloane\\, the Eclipse? How is Rey so powerful with no training? Why did Snoke want to kill Luke? \\nAlso\\, killing off 5 main characters with little or no development was shocking fan service. Porgs\\, Farthiers and BB9E - purely promoted to sell merchandise. This movie disregarded 40 years with of lore and character\/ story development and has left more puzzling questions than it answered. I love all the other movies and have never complained about one but TLJ has taken the biscuit and people who go to watch it need to be warned that everything they know and love about Star Wars will literally be torn up and threw away in this movie.","true":true}
