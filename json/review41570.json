Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is flashy and has star wars characters. Story wise it is sub par. But I can accept a bad movie. Even in star wars. The thing I cannot forgive destroying thr character of one of my childhood heros. I have a very hard time believing luke\\, who fought so hard for the last remnants of light and good in his father even after losing a hand to him would turn around and try to kill his apprentice in his sleep\\, just because he was exhibiting dark side tendencies. \\n\\nBut aside from ruining childhood character this is just a bad movie. A third of the movie happens for no reason and has no payoff (the casino arc). The main characters face no real sacrifices or struggle. Rey has no problem with anything she does\\, never faces opposition too great. The worst thing that happens to her is she gets force tortured and she just bounces right back. She has no negative reprecusions from gaining so much power so fast as other jedi have. In the past when you gained power extremely fast you could'nt control it properly and you would sense things you didn't want to. You wouldn't just get used to it immediately. There is no heros journey for rey\\, she is a board.","true":true}
