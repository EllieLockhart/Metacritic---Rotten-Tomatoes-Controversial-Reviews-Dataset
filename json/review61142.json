What they did to Joel is so stupid\\, such a waste\\, such a... just **** The only enjoyable part is that you get to beat the crap out of both main characters at one point or the other. I spent half the game wishing that clickers ate them both. By the way\\, the zombies were just extras here\\, no real threat or really relevant in any way. Just stupid\\, crappy people with stupid crappy agendas and motivations and a team who consciously decided to ignore everything that made the first game awesome in order to add dysfunctional pregnant women\\, homosexual sex (yes\\, I mean Abby and Owen too... that was intended as two men... or two dogs in heat) and all around stupidity. They made every man in the story weak to try to make the woman seem strong and all they achieved was making them nonsensical\\, selfish and immature. Great job Naughty Dog. After waiting so much time to play it and as a huge fan of the first one I honestly wish this game didn't exist.\r\rBottom line is... the only way to enjoy this game is if you don't think or if you never played the first. Any amount of brain will get in the way of enjoying this \\\"jewel.\\\"\u2026 Expand","true":true}
