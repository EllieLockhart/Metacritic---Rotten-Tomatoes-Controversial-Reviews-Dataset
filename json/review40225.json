Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the movie I wanted to see.  Technically it was a beautifully shot movie\\, with a couple of homages to the Star Wars we all know and love(d).  Wasteful\\, non-inspiring story.  I understand the logic of why they did what they did with the Skywalker's in this movie\\, but it is sure to make fans upset.  This movie has cured me of standing in line opening night for the latest Star Wars movie\\, which I have done since I was 5 years old when the original Star Wars A New Hope opened.  I feel like the writer\/director didn't care about the audience\\, and I felt my time was wasted on huge chunks of the movie that had nothing to do with the plot.  I'll see the next movie\\, but I won't rush to see it.","true":true}
