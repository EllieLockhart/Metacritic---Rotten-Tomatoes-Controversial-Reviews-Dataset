Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to walk out of the movie\\, wish I had never paid for 5 tickets for myself and family.   The movie looks great as a scifi flick but the story sucked for Star Wars.","true":true}
