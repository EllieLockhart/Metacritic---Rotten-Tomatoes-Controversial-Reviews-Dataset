Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social justice litered throughout\\, not to mention a shoddy story full of plot holes that is inexcusable for a movie of this budget and caliber. The movie intentionally messes with the viewer\\, more preoccupied with \\\"gotcha games\\\" than story cohesion. The special effects are good\\, but if you paid more attention to the story like I did\\, you'll quickly forget the tired nostalgic coat of paint on this disgrace of a film.  I've never been upset by movies\\, not the prequels\\, not the transformers movies. This is the first movie I truly hate. I'd give it 1\/2 a star\\, but RT doesn't count those.","true":true}
