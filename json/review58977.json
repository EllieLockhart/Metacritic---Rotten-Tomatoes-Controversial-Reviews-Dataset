This is the last time I trust user reviews on this site. I was surprised how wrong they were. Its clear theres 2 sides who are angry:  metacritic deleting reviews AND people who are just immature and havent given the story a chance. Btw Abby is not a trans. Not that it matters but theres so many false information out there. This game is NoT  a 10 but not a 0It is better the the first!  This is the last time I trust user reviews on this site.

Btw Abby is not a trans. Not that it matters but theres so many false information out there. This game is NoT  a 10 but not a 0 either.The story is great. Its meaningful and the plot unravels in an exciting way. The graphics are good but I dont score it an 8 for that. I mainly think it was worth it. One of my favs for this gen. The envirobment and their puzzlish design are the main reason I enjoyed the gameplay. Its a decent game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
