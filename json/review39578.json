Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film was the biggest pile of poo i've ever seen. there are so many plot holes so many errors it's just a horrid mess of a film. how on earth it got approved is beyond me. RJ should never be able to get a job again as he has no idea what he's doing. utter joke!","true":true}
