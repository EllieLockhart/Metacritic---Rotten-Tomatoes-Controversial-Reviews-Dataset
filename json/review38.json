On the surface\\, Yakuza 0 can look quite negative: its graphics and textures look awful\\, the stiff animation models\\, the sometimes buggy AIs of bystanders\\, the lack of way points or proper labels of properties and places\\, the invisible walls and objects\\, etc. This alone could spell disaster for any game sold on modern hardware\\, so it speaks volumes that this game not only holds its ground with its limitations\\, but drop kicks expectations sky high. That's the greatness of this game; it soars above so many modern titles for keeping the core foundation of satisfying gameplay\\, great stories ripped right out of action and mafia films with its own originality\\, metric tons of activities (all surprisingly fun to do) and so much respect for its players that even for $60 this is highway robbery and would have been assaulted by most game companies in the worst of ways. Thankfully\\, this is a 2 games (you could even argue 3) in 1 that is absolutely worth your time. Let me briefly explain the game more to not mislead.\r\rStory - Arguably one of the best\\, well-written\\, solid voicework and mature tone to a game I have not seen this strong in a long time. While some can argue the dissonant tone of the game might take wind out of its sails\\, the balancing of this tone is so well executed that it blows my mind. The plot is a bit lengthy and definitely full of dialogue\\, but watching it was engrossing. The ending went on longer than I expected and even after all of what happen I felt I only scratched the surface of this series.\r\rCharacters - What a hell of a character list. Kazama Kiryu and Majima Goro (the latter in particular) present a air of realism\\, stoicism\\, grit and gusto that had me sold after the first chapters they appear in. The other characters of the different families and clans all had complex and deep personas that oozed curiosity. For a game mirroring action and mafia films this was a kickass cast of people. Well done voice acting as well.\r\rCombat - Satisfying\\, but I would not call it outstanding overall. It has issues in most of its abilities (even some of the styles themselves) being weak additions and not worth the investment. The repetition can set in after awhile and for those wanting a deeper system you wont find that here. This is more of a old school beatem up (with absolutely amazing if not insane finishers and heat action moves) that carries problems as a result. Regardless\\, this serves its part and at least keeps me interested. The fourth weapon slot is forgettable and the use of handguns by enemies can be a pain to deal with. Bosses are not really different from normal enemies and easy to abuse\\, but the QTE events make them memorable and stand out alot.\r\rMinigames - So many of them\\, ranging from blackjack to soft core porn videos\\, karaoke to shogi\\, this game has it all and it serves the point of \\\"just because you have to be yakuza serious\\, doesnt mean you cant have yakuza fun\\\". Add to that a real estate and club management and this alone could be its own game on some mobile free stuff. I absolutely loved it all.\r\rSubstories\/Challenges: Completing these were overall good with some memorable and well written pieces that had me laughing one minute and sobbing the next. The objectives themselves might be simple or fetchy\\, but the writing to them is great and is able to keep that dissonant tone consistent throughout with no real sign of weakness. Then you have challenges that test your abilities and skills to learn new moves with a ton to offer you.\r\rI feel almost insulting this game for not talking more about it\\, but it is one of those games that is better to play and roll with its crappy initial impression than to have someone fully explain it. I would like to add a few more things to it: the music is well done and memorable\\, the crafting system is weak\\, new game plus\\, free mode and other options to play with another player is insane. Playing over 50+ hours felt like the first course and based on how much more I would still have to do\\, this would easily be a 100+ hour game to 100% complete\\, with a exciting energy to it that makes me smile ear to ear.\r\rAs a newcomer to the series\\, I was initially skeptical but now I consider Yakuza 0 to be a colossal achievement for what it wants to accomplish and feel inclined to play the remasters and the future Yakuza 6. This game is a action packed treat and if you have a PS4 this is an absolute buy\\, no questions asked. Despite its outdated nature\\, the beating heart of nostalgia gaming of Yakuza 0 burns as passionately as Kiryu and Majima's spirits and is an excellent game for anyone to play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
