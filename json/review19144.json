Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just a bad movie. Long and boring\\, messy and incoherent. Riddled with plotholes\\, pointless plotlines\\, wasted characters and gibberish dialogue. \\nThink of the Hobbit or Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Thats what it's like. \\nNot a blatant remake like TFA\\, but it borrows many plots and scenes from ESB and ROTJ.\\nI think I will forget about the Disney trilogy and stick to George Lucas' vision from now on. After the Battle of Endor\\, there was peace in the Galaxy\\, the force was in balance and they lived happily ever after. The end.\\nPS. I liked the porgs. They are cute.","true":true}
