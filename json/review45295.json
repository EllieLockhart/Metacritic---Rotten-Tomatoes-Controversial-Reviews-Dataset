Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Usually I know I probably won't like a movie if the critics rate it higher than the users but this time I agree with the critics. A fantastic movie and wonderful addition to the Star Wars legacy. With the exception of a couple moments I thought this was a great film and I like where they are heading with what this film keeps saying... they are wiping the slate clean and heading in a new direction. It's time for the world to evolve and I think they set that up perfectly. Unless you are a die-hard Star Wars nerd who just want what they have always know to keep going you won't be disappointed. The emotional connection and story between Rey and Kylo is the most fascinating thus far in the Star Wars universe. More excited with where Star Wars will go than before I saw this.","true":true}
