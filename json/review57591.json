Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ could very well be the best Star Wars movie we've ever received. It defies your expectations at every turn\\, and that seems to be why so many people have a problem with it. For the first time in a LONG time\\, I was legitimately on the edge of my seat\\, physically tensed up\\, not knowing what would happen. Beautiful thematic messages permeate the entire story (the role that failure plays in our lives\\, as well as the idea to \\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to\\\")\\, and there is a LOT of story. The long run time is absolutely justified for me\\, and I honestly would have been fine with it being even longer. A joy for a Star Wars fan eager to see something new.","true":true}
