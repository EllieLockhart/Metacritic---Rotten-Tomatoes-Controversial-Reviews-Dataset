Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure visuals are nice to have and everything\\, but people seem to completely gloss over how badly this film butchers the franchise as a whole. I'd much rather watch a film that plays it safe like Force Awakens than a film which makes idiotic choices that attempt to ruin a once beloved series.\\n\\nCritics are clearly paid off to write positive reviews.","true":true}
