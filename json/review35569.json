Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a complete disgrace to the Star Wars legacy. The script is terrible. The characters have no development whatsoever. Watching it felt like being slapped in the face repeatedly by Disney for 2 1\/2 hours. This is coming from a die-hard Star Wars fan. Also\\, Star Wars is an action\/adventure story\\, not a comedy. And Luke Skywalker would NEVER throw his light saber over his shoulder. ","true":true}
