Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review. I had to make one after seeing this movie has a 93% from the \\\"professional\\\" critics.\\n\\nGo see it though\\, form your own opinion. Especially if you're a Star Wars fan. But I might just wait for the Blu-Ray of Episode 9 rather than race to see it opening day in the theater.\\n\\n\\nKeep in mind\\, these are immediate reactions from a Star Wars fan. I've only seen the movie once. Maybe my opinion will change down the road.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn-depth review---------- SPOILERS BELOW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Major Gripe: This is Barely a Sequel to The Force Awakens---\\n\\n\\nAs a stand alone film- maybe you'll like it. Maybe a non-Star Wars fan will love it. As a Star Wars fan\\, though\\, it's impossible for me to imagine what that would be like. I can only look at this movie as chapter 8 of a long standing series of stories\\, and most importantly\\, the direct sequel to 2015's The Force Awakens.\\n\\nI can't talk about how disappointing The Last Jedi is without talking about The Force Awakens...\\n\\nThe Force Awakens was extremely polarizing- the creators went the safe route. After the prequels became legendary for how terrible they were\\, Disney did not want to take any risks. Thus\\, Fan Service: The Movie was born. \\n\\nSome things in TFA were unforgivably stupid- the rushed plot\\, the convenient solutions to every problem\\, the second \\\"bigger\\\" deadlier Death Star- all silly. But still\\, TFA really was the re-awakening of the Star Wars franchise. Though basically a \\\"soft reboot\\\" of Episode IV\\, they still had plenty of new interesting lore- much of it left completely unexplained.\\n\\nWho was Snoke? How did he become so powerful? Has he always been behind the scenes? Is he Darth Plagueis? What are Rey's origins? Why is Ben Solo so consumed with hatred\\, what happened in his childhood? What happened after episode 6- after finally besting the empire\\, how the HELL did they come back 10 times stronger? Shouldn't THEY be the Resistance? Who were the Knights of Ren? What is Rey and Kylo's connection (see Rey's constant flashbacks\\, she appears to be present when Kylo and the Knights slaughter the Jedis at the temple).\\n\\nOver the next few years\\, we fans spent countless hours theorizing the answers to those questions. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens was a giant alley-oop- awesome characters were introduced\\, new adventures were to be had\\, new lore to discover\\, and there was so much mystery everywhere we looked. \\n\\nEnough was not explained in The Force Awakens-- and that would have been fine-- if the next film followed through and received the aforementioned alley-oop. Instead\\, Rian Johnson grabs the ball\\, and chucks it out of bounds. Completely intentionally. \\n\\nRian Johnson doesn't give a shit about J. J. Abrams ideas\\, and man\\, does it show. \\n\\nI am convinced that Snoke's critique of Kylo Ren is really Rian Johnson tearing apart Abrams movie. \\\"Take off that ridiculous thing\\,\\\" he says to Kylo\\, echoing many fans sentiment that wearing a voice altering mask is pretty stupid if you don't need it. He then berates him for getting bested by a kid who's never held a light saber before-- again\\, something many fans didn't like about the previous film.\\n\\nAfter seeing The Force Awakens\\, my friends and I were all incredibly excited. But I had a caveat- with all the questions that have opened up\\, then the next movie(s) really need to step things up\\, and give us answers. \\n\\nIf I hadn't made that clear yet- nothing gets answered. And the answers you do get are so incredibly underwhelming you'll be in disbelief.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'll go through each of the most disappointing aspects:\\n\\n\\n\\n-No one knows who\/what Snoke is\\, how he rose to power\\, his connection to any characters\\, by the way Kylo Ren kills him incredibly easily and he's dead. The end.\\n\\n\\n-Rey's parents are nobodies\\, confirmed by Kylo Ren. The entire movie Kylo is teasing Rey- \\\"You want to know who your parents are right?\\\" only to reveal- \\\"Oh\\, they're just nobodies.\\\"\\n\\nSo for 2 movies we've been wondering who her parents are. Where they're from\\, where they went. We've seen this girl who has more power than Anakin and Luke and any Jedi ever\\, clearly far more than Ben Solo since he was trained and got bested by her in combat\\, and the film emphasizes that her parentage is a mystery. \\n\\nWhy tease us? Why not just show her parents in a photograph in Episode 7. \\\"Yeah\\, they were worthless drunks who sold me for money.\\\"\\n\\nIt's almost like Johnson thought\\, \\\"Heh\\, they're expecting this movie to parallel Empire Strikes Back and have a huge family revelation\\, I'll do the exact opposite and underwhelm the shit out of them!!\\\"\\n\\nAlso\\, how the hell does Kylo Ren know anything about Rey's parents? \\n\\nThere is a possibility that Kylo was just lying. There is a possibility that there is more to the story. There is a possibility that something more interesting than THEY WERE NOBODIES WILL BE REVEALED IN EPISODE 9. But I guess I won't hold my breath.\\n\\nI'm not saying she had to be Luke's daughter or Han's daughter or Chewbacca's cousin. She can still be some random person. But there was way too much teasing and buildup about this character for her to just... have no family backstory whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n-No more details are offered about how the good guys went from saving the galaxy in VI\\, to basically being the rebels all over again in VII. \\n\\n-The Knights of Ren aren't mentioned at all. They're dead I guess. \\n\\n-There's no past-connection between Rey and Kylo. He just knows her parents were nobodies\\, somehow.\\n\\n-Ben turned evil because he saw Luke holding his light saber over him\\, about to kill him. Well\\, Luke said he was overtaken for a moment\\, but he stopped himself\\, and felt ashamed. But in Ben's eyes\\, he was about to get murdered. Okay\\, I can see that being the \\\"final straw\\\" that got Ben to really say\\, \\\"Forget this light side stuff.\\\"\\n\\nBut my god. I'm sorry\\, we need more for me to believe this villain. \\n\\nVader's mother was kidnapped and presumably tortured and died not long after. The love of his life\\, his sole reason for being\\, he believed was going to die unless he took action. He did the unthinkable and committed great acts of evil...  He felt there was no other way and was so consumed with his fear of losing Padme. We got to watch this young boy turn to the dark side.\\n\\nApparently Disney is planning on making a Kylo Ren origin story\\, or something\\, because nothing is explained. Kylo looked like a pouty\\, spoilt brat in TFA. I had hoped with more elaboration on his hopefully traumatic past\\, we would learn why somebody would choose  a path of evil. Yeah\\, no. Stay tuned for Star Wars Origins: The Kylo Ren Saga in a few years.\\n\\nAnd notice this-- I am not opposed to Kylo Ren simply being a natural born psychopath. Like in real life\\, it's totally plausible that he was just born a murderous\\, deranged human being. But that's obviously not the case. Through 2 movies now we get to watch Kylo's lame \\\"internal conflict\\,\\\" bouncing back and forth between doing terrible\\, evil things\\, and people saying he's conflicted and not evil enough\\, then he gets mad about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides being a terrible follow up to The Force Awakens\\, the following made it hard to call it a \\\"good\\\" Star Wars film...\\n\\n-Kylo Ren. This deserves a section all on it's own. This character had potential in The Force Awakens\\, and a hell of a lot to live up to.\\n\\nThe implied romantic connection between Rey and Kylo needs to die. Or at least\\, the implied \\\"sexy shirtless Kylo\\\" scene was an issue for me. I'm not sure if they're hinting at some kind of romance between the two of these characters. Snoke formed some kind of Force telepathic messaging system between the two\\, to basically lead Rey to him. I thought that was cool.\\n\\nWhat isn't cool is how easily Kylo gets Rey to feel sympathy for him. A few conversations was all it took. And when he's shown once without his shirt\\, she stammers \\\"Can you put a shirt on?\\\" appearing flustered. Call me crazy\\, but I'm fairly certain that was intentional.\\n\\nI can't begin to explain my disgust for this concept. This man is the space wizard equivalent of Jeffrey Dahmer. He murdered (possibly) children at the Jedi temple\\, if not children then whatever\\, innocent people. He cheap shotted his own dad\\, as his father pleaded for cooperation and showed he'd do whatever it took to help his son. \\n\\nHan's murder wasn't like\\, a space station blowing up and Han died off screen. Kylo didn't blow up Han's ship. He brutally and sadistically murdered him\\, staring into his father's eyes. \\n\\nHonestly\\, I thought it was too dark for Star Wars\\, and kind of just\\, way too edgy. But it happened.\\n\\nAnd I don't think the movie realizes this.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with Kylo Ren is\\, in the last movie\\, he did the most irredeemable thing he could do. That was supposed to be his moment of turning to the dark side completely.\\n\\nAnd yet here we are- another movie onward- still hearing about how \\\"conflicted\\\" he is. Dude. What. You can't even be evil right? He hesitates to blow his mother up (wow\\, what a great guy)\\, so I guess we're supposed to notice that and go\\, \\\"Maybe there is still good in him??\\\"\\n\\n\\n...why the hell should I care??? I don't feel sorry for him. I don't care about him. He's a sadistic murderer who is trying so\\, so hard to achieve\\, whatever\\, optimum evil-ness\\, and even failing at that. The movie doesn't even give me a messed up childhood story to feel some kind of sympathy for him (uncle thinking about killing him for a second is no where near enough motivation).\\n\\nAnd this is what I can't stand. I'm the audience member. I hate Kylo Ren. He's clearly incredibly evil. He's not Anakin Skywalker\\, he's not the father of the main character\\, he's nobody. I don't give a shit about him \\\"being redeemed\\\" or \\\"becoming good.\\\"\\n\\n\\n....can someone tell me why the hell Rey cares??\\n\\nI mean\\, my god. She'll kill countless storm troopers without a second thought\\, but WOAH\\, the guy who betrayed his whole family and has nearly taken over the galaxy and murdered her mentor\\, he deserves a second (third? fourth?) chance!\\n\\nKylo was bad ass in the opening scenes of The Force Awakens. We soon saw he was frail\\, weak\\, not matured. Many people were disappointed. I was excited\\, because I felt he would \\\"grow into his own\\\" by the next film. His training would be complete by episode 8. And after murdering his own father\\, it was clear this guy was fully committed to evil\\, and would be a formidable villain.\\n\\nInstead\\, we get the same wishy washy\\, pouty\\, insecure man child villain from the last movie. Han's death was essentially completely meaningless. Snoke even proposes that if he murders Rey\\, THEN he'll TRULY be on the dark side! \\n\\nReally? Would he really? Or would he kill her\\, then feel even more conflicted\\, and smash some electronics\\, then hesitate to shoot his mom\\, then be mad that he's not evil enough\\, and on and on and on. \\n\\nThis \\\"internal conflict\\\" is.... it's just horrible. Adam Driver is great. It's not his fault. The script is just awful- AS a follow up to The Force Awakens. It shows no progression.\\n\\nSure\\, eventually he decides he's going to be the Supreme Ruler\\, I mean\\, that's more out of convenience than anything else. Snoke is dead. Why not? Honestly- what the hell else would he do? The only thing I know about Ben Solo is he tries really hard to be evil and disappoints everyone.\\n\\nNo one knows what to do with Kylo. Apparently no matter who he murders\\, he's still worthy of redemption. I'm surprised to see so many fans feeling this way\\, but apparently the new director does as well. For me\\, as an audience member to care about Kylo being redeemed\\, I need a reason. You know\\, like how I liked Luke Skywalker\\, and I understood that his father was Vader-- I wanted Luke to be happy\\, so I rooted for him\\, and thus hoped Vader would turn.\\n\\n\\nI don't know how Ren can be salvaged for the next movie\\, because where he stands now\\, he's just so boring. I predict more \\\"internal struggling\\\" (for some reason)\\, Rey fighting hard to turn him good (for some reason)\\, and I guess in the end he'll sacrifice himself or something and be redeemed\\, which I should be happy about (for some reason).\\n\\n-Rey \\\"trained\\\" as a Jedi for like\\, 2 days\\, whereas Luke trained with Obi Wan\\, and then with Yoda for months\\, and still lost to Vader. Rey is just as crazily overpowered as she was in the first movie\\, and even worse\\, now it's confirmed she's literally a nobody. Scrap Finn's completely pointless code breaker side plot and focus on Rey and Luke's relationship (which\\, really\\, there wasn't one).\\n\\n\\n-Luke was awesome\\, but he deserved better. A lot better. A better plot\\, a better ending\\, better motivation\\, just.... Luke deserved better. Wish we actually got to see him in action instead of a damn mirage. I mean\\, could there have been some kind of reason besides cowardice that drove him to that island? Why that island? Maybe he wanted to read the ancient texts.... for a specific purpose? Maybe he was looking into more advanced ways to work with the force? Maybe he lost his mind in this pursuit\\, and became a hermit? Just\\, something\\, ANYTHING besides he gave up in life?\\n\\nI will say\\, I was at peace with him looking at the sunset with that classic music playing\\, and he disappeared. But that was too soon. Maybe for the third movie. This is the legendary Luke. And he basically trains Rey for a few days then shows up and casts a Body Double spell and dies.\\n\\nThis character was the whole focal point of the last movie-- finding this guy-- and he barely does anything and dies.\\n\\nLike I said. Rian Johnson is not shy showing his disdain for the previously established storylines. I believe the \\\"ancient Jedi texts\\\" being burned was a metaphor- \\\"Fuck the last movie\\, I'm doing things my way!\\\"\\n\\nThat would be fine normally\\, maybe if YOU made episode VII... but you sort of ruined this trilogy by changing it so drastically. We'll see what happens in IX.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd some minor nitpicks of mine....\\n\\n\\n\\n-Captain Strong Woman\\, I forgot her name\\, the purple haired lady who seems more like an English teacher than an authoritative commander- this character. She was difficult to watch and pretty pointless. By the way she sacrifices herself. Good bye character we just met\\, such an emotional moment.\\n\\n-Yoda's cameo was cool but lame at the same time. I love that he showed up. I like what he said. But it was so anti climactic... It was like Yoda pops up every few weeks to say hi. I expected a lot more emotion out of Luke.\\n\\n-You've heard it a million times but yes Leia force floating through space is probably the dumbest thing in the franchise.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that being said\\, here are things I liked about the movie that other people complained about:\\n\\n-\\\"The porgs are annoying and just put their to sell toys\\\"--- newflash\\, the entire franchise exists to sell toys. The porgs are cute. And only $19.99 at your local Best Buy.\\n\\n-\\\"Luke Force projected himself and had a blue light saber\\, uh it should have been green. \\\"--- Such a stupid detail. There are more than 3 light sabers in the galaxy. If the reason for this gripe is Kylo should have said\\, \\\"A blue light saber...? But... I saw that blue light saber break apart in 2!! You must be a force projected image!!\\\" I mean\\, I don't know\\, that's pretty stupid. \\n\\n-\\\"The plot about the ships running out of gas is stupid and the chase is too slow.\\\"-- I actually thought this was somewhat exciting. Okay\\, maybe kind of slow.\\n\\n-\\\"Finn and Rose's plot was pointless\\, they failed and accomplished nothing.\\\"-- True\\, but it was entertaining. I would have rather the film focused on\\, you know\\, expanding on the lore and characters and relationships we care about. But I didn't find anything wrong with those scenes. It was normal\\, fun\\, action movie stuff. It's nice to see Finn get a love interest (possibly)\\, since apparently Rey only likes him as a friend.\\n\\n-\\\"The humor was Marvelly and cringe-worthy omg Star Wars is serious.\\\" -- It was funny\\, I had no problem with it. The prequel characters were dry and humorless\\, let's not go back to that\\, okay?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd just things I liked in general:\\n\\n-Acting was great\\n\\n-Good visuals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo that's it. I mean\\, I enjoyed seeing the movie. I laughed\\, I liked the action. But as the next chapter in the epic Star Wars story\\, I really don't think it holds up.","true":true}
