Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie ever made.  Plot was terrible and boring.  So many twists that just come out of nowhere and for really no reason. There isn't enough time for me to explain everything I hated about this movie.  I heard Rian Johnson will do another trilogy and\\, I will pass on seeing that.  I hope Disney comes to its senses and gets rid of RJ.  This movie is just so bad.  Everything!","true":true}
