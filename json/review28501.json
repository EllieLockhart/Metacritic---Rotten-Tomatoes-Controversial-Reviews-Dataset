Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty poor film all in all. Not much added to the story\\, Finn and Rose in a pointless side story mixed with stupid things like Laura Dern keeping her plans a secret and Leah being able to fly in space???\\n\\nNot sure I'll go see the next installment.","true":true}
