Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fabulous movie. Great story\\, high fidelity to the core DNA\\, excellent cast\\, stunning special effects. I will see it again for sure. No idea why the audience score is so low. Critics score is closer to the reality.","true":true}
