Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan and began this journey as a 5 year old in 1977.  I've seen them all and have had a hard time ranking this film.  Of the Disney offerings\\, it is the worst of the three.  Rogue One is their best offering so far.  After it was over and the lights came up\\, my first thought was\\, what was that?  The joke between Poe and Hux to start off was painful.  I was fine with Luke's character changes.  He's an old curmudgeon now.  He's not the whiny 18 year old from a New Hope anymore.  I could see how he could get to that point.  Leia's character arc was acceptable to me and I was fine with her floating through space...it's just a new use of the force we haven't seen yet.  We don't know if she was secretly using the force all these years.  She had the same reactions to Han's death that Obi-Wan had when Alderaan blew up\\, so she is obviously very strong with some elements of the force.  For me personally\\, it felt like ROTJ does to me after seeing it 34 years ago.  It had some really good parts and some really bad parts.  I still struggle with the Jungle Care Bears of ROTJ.  And yes\\, Finn is a useless character sent off on a useless wild PC goose chase....just dumb.\\n\\nIf I had to rank it along with all the others\\, from best to worst\\, I would say...\\n\\nIV\\nV\\nRogue One\\nVI\\nVII\\nIII\\nVIII\\nII\\nI","true":true}
