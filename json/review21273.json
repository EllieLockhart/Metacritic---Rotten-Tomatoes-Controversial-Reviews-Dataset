Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie hoping for an original plot with real stakes. The visual cinematic's were top notch but the humor was trash\\, the whole Canto Bite narrative was garbage\\, and Luke wasn't himself. Truly wish they had Leia force hold an atmosphere bubble or something more physics 'possible'.","true":true}
