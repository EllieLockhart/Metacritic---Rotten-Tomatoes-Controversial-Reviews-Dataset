Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good.  Certainly not the best Star Wars\\, but definitely a solid addition to the franchise.  There were parts I thought weren't great and parts I really liked\\, but all in all it was visually stunning and occasionally beautiful and poignant.","true":true}
