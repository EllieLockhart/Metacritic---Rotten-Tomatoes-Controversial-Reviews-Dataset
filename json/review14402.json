Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had just turned five in 1977 when I saw Star Wars; so\\, like many\\, I grew up with Star Wars.  I read over sixty of the Expanded Universe books and took Disney's punch in the gut (i.e. acting like they never happen)\\, but I kept a positive attitude\\, saw TFA and loved it.   Moved on to Rogue One and can honestly say it's one of my favorite Star Wars movies.\\n\\nI guess Disney felt like I needed another punch in the gut\\, because they made this movie.  I could go on about the plot holes and underdeveloped characters\\, but I simply cannot get past the Luke Skywalker portrayed in this movie.   The EU books did a phenomenal job of portraying Luke's flaws\\, but gave us the Hero we knew and loved.  THE GRUMPY OLD MAN IN THIS MOVIE WAS #NOTMYLUKE\\n\\n\\nThis movie will make a ton of cash\\, but it won't get another penny from me...","true":true}
