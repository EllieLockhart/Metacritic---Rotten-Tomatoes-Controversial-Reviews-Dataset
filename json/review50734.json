Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bad film and an even worse Star Wars film. Lazily and poorly written and - at the ridiculous length of two and a half  hours - a chore to sit through.","true":true}
