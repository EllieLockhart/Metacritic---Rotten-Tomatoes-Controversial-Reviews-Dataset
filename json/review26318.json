Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the Star Wars I was looking for. Between the major plot holes\\, disservice they do to old characters\\, and being beaten over the head with political agenda I have to wonder if Star Wars is even for me anymore. Very disappointed.","true":true}
