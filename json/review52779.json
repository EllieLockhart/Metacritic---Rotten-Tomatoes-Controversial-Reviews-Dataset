Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long\\, expensive\\, poorly made film.  Weak portrayals of existing characters\\, badly introduced new characters\\, forgettable dialog\\, and the most stupid villains ever conceived.  What would be merely disappointing in a stand alone space opera becomes unforgivable as part of the beloved Star Wars property.  Gaping plot holes are papered over with too much CGI.  Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams are capable of far better than this.  The film should take a Mulligan and be done over.","true":true}
