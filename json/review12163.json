Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a long-time SW super fan... I saw New Hope 5 times... Look\\, all the fan backlash is real and good reasons... We fans want the canon resp cted. We want zero SJW and political vi ws kept out of our (yes\\, OUR) franchise... This was a terribly made movie ?? on so many levels. It's just awful... I avoided Solo to help send a message. Stop screwing with the franchise !!!!!!!","true":true}
