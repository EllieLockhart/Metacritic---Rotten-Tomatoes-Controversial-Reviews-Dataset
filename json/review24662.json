Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was awful\\, Finn and Rose were awful...the story line for Luke was awful.  Who is Snoke?  Why did Rose get a little back story?  Leia floating through space?  Some great parts but overall really disappointed.","true":true}
