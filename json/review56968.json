Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film ever They ruined Luke Skywalker and made him a coward. Rey is an overpowered character who has learned nothing in these films. Kylo Ren is a crybaby weak and pathetic villain. Story is badly written is very mundane no lightsaber fight no cool action from Luke boring new characters Rian Johnson you are the man who ruined Star Wars forever and divided us this movie is the worst blockbuster of all time. In 1 year we went from the best Star Wars film so far in Rogue One IMO to the worst in the last jedi fact! Mr Johnson should be dismissed from Lucasfilm and be banned from working on Star Wars films and other blockbusters. He can stick to indie films.","true":true}
