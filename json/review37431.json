Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are a lot of things that I i felt were good with this movie\\, but overall the pacing\\, plot and just general sloppiness of the writing killed it for me. I keep seeing people saying its a new take\\, but when you rip whole scenes worth of dialogue it isn't new. \\n\\nI understand people are excited for the 'new' Star Wars\\, but for me; i just can't be happy about a movie that wants to burn down what came before it. There's a difference between moving on\\, and trampling on what came before you. The movie had promise and potential\\, but it was lost somewhere (maybe the cutting room floor).","true":true}
