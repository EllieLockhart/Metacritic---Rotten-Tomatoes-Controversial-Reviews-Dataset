Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent movie. People need to realize that star wars is eventually going to have to move on from the original trilogy. This film is something never seen before in a star war movie- it look risks and wasn't afraid to change. Thats what makes it so captivating and outstanding. And with acting skills such as those from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley its going to be a good movie. I wasn't expecting such great skills from them. Daisy gives an even greater sense of heart to Rey which makes you love her even more. Adam is incredible with Kylo\\, he gives such feeling that even at times you feel compassion for Kylo. It is excellent and a great step to the future of star wars.","true":true}
