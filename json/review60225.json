If you want a game that ruins all of the progress between Joel and Ellie this is for you. I was so so excited to play this game\\, Joel and Ellie built up they\u2019re relationship in the first game and that was partly what was so good about it. The only reason it gets a 1 is because it had some nice graphics. We liked the last of us part one because of Joel and Ellie\\, who on earth thought it was a good idea to not have any dialogue between Joel and Ellie and then just kill him off in front of her\\, TO PRETTY MUCH START THE GAME?? it\u2019s unbelievable that people thought this was the way to go about it. What a waste. This may as well been a completely different franchise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
