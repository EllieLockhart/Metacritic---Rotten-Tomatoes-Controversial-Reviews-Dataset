Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I suspect that many people leaving reviews haven't actually seen the movie\\, but are just blindly voting in opposition to the film's multiculturalism. For my part\\, I thought the film played homage to the original Star Wars while continuing the storyline perfectly. Of course there were some comedic episodes that were a bit distracting\\, but overall the film should be appealing to both old Star Wars fans and newcomers. ","true":true}
