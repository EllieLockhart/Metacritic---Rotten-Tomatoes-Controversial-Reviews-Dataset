Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film to date by far.  There is so much wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to begin.  Other than the visuals and special effects\\, it falls shorts on story\\, character development\\, and dialogue. Mainly\\, it does not do Luke Skywalker any justice and undoes his character completely from the original trilogy.  Completely shameful.","true":true}
