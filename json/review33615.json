Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. I wouldn't consider myself a huge star wars fan but more of a science fiction fan and this was not a great movie either way. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because of just a few great moments through the movie but not enough to redeem it. I've never felt the urge to walk out of a theater before until i saw this movie.","true":true}
