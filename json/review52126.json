Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After TFA I wasn't expecting too much from TLJ but somehow it still managed to disappoint me. The writing is awful with clumsy humour throughout. The plot was shoddy and scattered. Luke Skywalker isn't Luke Skywalker other than it's Mark Hamill. Poor Mark Hamill being handed a s@&t sandwich after waiting so long to reprise the role. I'm giving it 2 stars as there were a couple of redeeming scenes. Overall it was overly long\\, I didn't care about any of the characters and was completely bored by the end.","true":true}
