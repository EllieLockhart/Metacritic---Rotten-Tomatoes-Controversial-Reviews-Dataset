Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"\\\"When we have we don't appreciate\\, when we lose\\, we take revenge.\\\" It is with these words that I would characterize The Last of Us Part II.\rAt first I hated the game and the story\\, but after thinking about what I saw\\, I changed my mind and consider the story of this game\\, if not great then definitely cool and important for the industry.\rAbby's character loses his father and the decision is revenge. She does it viciously\\, killing Joel in front of Ellie. The consequences are obvious - Ellie takes revenge for Joel and almost completes what she should\\, but STOP .. what should? Revenge?\rIn this cycle of revenges\\, we understand one SIMPLEST thing - revenge does not lead to anything good\\, it will not become easier for anyone\\, it won't bring people back and etc. We are convinced of this both from the side of Abby\\, who losed all her friends and everything as result of revenge and from the side of Ellie too\\, who losed her friend Jesse\\, almost losed Dina (pregnant!) and Tommy.\rThat's why revenge does not lead to good\\, and if players understands it then it will be the best experience from this game\\, and if not they will simply obscure it and will not understand the message of the authors.\rAbout the moment (actually a couple of moments) where Ellie were angry to Joel for pulling her out at the end of the first part. These words describe this in full - \\\"When we have we don't appreciate\\, when we lose\\, we take revenge.\\\"\r\rDrackman clearly took the BRAVEST move\\, turning the story around the way it was done and madmen like him are the engines of the industry\\, not otherwise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
