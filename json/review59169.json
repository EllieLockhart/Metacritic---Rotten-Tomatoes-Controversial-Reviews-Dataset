But it wasn't your story to tell in the first place. You're just a passenger. And giving a 0 to a technical\/acting masterpiece just because you didn't get what you wanted is just plain stupid\\, be at least honest with yourself.\r\rFurthermore the first game lived in a morally grey area from the get go. If you ever thought Joel and Ellie were \\\"good guys\\\" you clearly have no idea what TLOU1 was about\\, and I kinda feel sorry for you.\r\rAlso sexuality and woke themes aren't pushed in the slightest during the game so whoever still bring that up clearly have not played the game and just hopped on some hate bandwagon for the sake of being a miserable sad human being.\r\rI enjoyed every second of this game\\, even tho it's not a \\\"fun\\\" game\\, it's a game that pushes you to understand complex feeling\\, feeling you are forced to embrace even if you didn't want to\\, but that are never gratuitous or out of context. It's a mature game\\, and clearly there are a lot of gamers out there that do not have such maturity to even grasp the basic elements of it.\r\rThis game is also not perfect and I would have liked a couple gameplay additions like a way to recall the horse or an attack from above tomb raider style.\r\rIn the end I would give it a solid 9. But I will give it a 10 to make up for the embarrassment the hateful and ignorant part of the gaming community has brought to the table.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
