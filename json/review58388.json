Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing Last Jedi for the first time\\, my initial reaction was extreme hatred. But\\, the next day\\, I ponderedany of what bothered me and decided I'd make a final decision on the film after a second viewing. Where Star Wars is usually a film that you can digest in one sitting and be satisfied (for the most part)\\, Last Jedi takes the series in so many new and very different directions that you may not be entirely ready. Along with that\\, plot elements build to a crescendo of twists not familiar to Star Wars audiences. With this reasoning\\, give yourself a second chance to see this movie. You may find you like more than you did the first time around\\, but overall\\, the hype was too high for this film. Trailers have ruined a great moviegoing experience by making it seem as though we were going to see a very different film. So\\, alas\\, I find this to be an all right Star Wars film. I love certain elements but truly hate others! As for Porgs\\, I can take 'em or leave 'em. ","true":true}
