Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the movie I was like wow what a good movie. I grew up watching star wars saw them all over million times. So few hours went past the movie popped up in my head again. I was like was it a good movie? The Movie dragged on forever. Here we are in space with space destroyers\\, tie fighters\\, millennium falcon\\,Atats\\, jedis\\,sabers\\, big weapons\\, and LUKE SKYWALKER and best you can come up with is running out of gas? WTF just happened here what a let down trash..... ","true":true}
