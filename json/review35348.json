Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The is a continuation of the degradation of the star wars franchise. With so much cohesive material in the EU it's a pitty that Disney has decided to destroy the Star Wars franchise with stories that are rushed to get produced and have each director tearing up the previous directors work. What the previous trilogy's had it was all one story and it had heart even with it's few problems ie pademe dying in child birth when Leia said she remembered . But it truly fleshed out the characters. Yes this movie has eye candy but it gives us no reason to love or hate the characters it introduces. Just another hollow cheap thrills no story movie","true":true}
