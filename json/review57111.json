Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is BY FAR the worst Start Wars movie ever made. Filled with stupid one-liners\\, empty mediocre story and shallow characters. The political statements were poorly presented and made this already horrible experience worse. There is not a single thing i can think of about this movie that I enjoyed. As a Star Wars fan I feel extremely sad and with no hope for the third installment of the franchise\\nTL\\,DR you sit there for 2 1\/2 hours  going through one shitty emotional plot hole to the next with shitty action scenes and mediocre acting. ALL THE CRITICS RAVING ABOUT THIS MOVIE ARE PAID...","true":true}
