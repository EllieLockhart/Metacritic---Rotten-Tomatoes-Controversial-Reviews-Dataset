Making a second part of the first game was not easy and the path they chose was the right one because nobody expected that course of history. As for the criticisms due to the certain role or certain outcome of such a character seem to me that there is a lack of arguments as it is part of the story and the loss of such a character plays a fundamental role\\, without it there would be no story. The game leaves a message of one of the best possible way. The game mechanics are much better than the previous one and graphically there is no comparison.
