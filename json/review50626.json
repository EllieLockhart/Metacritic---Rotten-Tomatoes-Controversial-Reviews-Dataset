Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"40 years of enthusiasm and hope for the triumph of a hero and this is how you end the legacy of Luke Skywalker?  This is the movie that will forever live in history as when the Star Wars franchise jumped the shark!  Boooo!  And that is just the start of where this movie falls down.","true":true}
