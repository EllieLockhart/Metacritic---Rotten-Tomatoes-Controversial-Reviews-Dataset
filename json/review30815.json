Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Snoke is just dead. Code Breaker side quest was weird and a waste of a half hour. Slowest space chase in history? Hold back plans from Poe for what reason? Leia survives space. Luke just disappears? Finn and whoever romance? This movie was just weird and I think had some political undertones which is never good.","true":true}
