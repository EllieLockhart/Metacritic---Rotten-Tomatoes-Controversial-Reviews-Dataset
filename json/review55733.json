Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the surface this is an entertaining movie. It's aesthetically Star Wars. All the bells and whistles are there and with great polish. The sound design and score are great as always. Really great cinematography\\, there are truly some awe inspiring shots throughout this film. \\n\\nUnderneath the surface though\\, there's nothing. This movie is completely hollow. Unlikable characters\\, badly written plot\\, shoehorned humor what seems like every two minutes (some of it works but most of it is just awkward and weird)\\, seemingly ignores 99% of continuity from episode 7\\, bad pacing\\, the list of flaws this movie has is long. \\n\\nIf you're only in it for the cheap thrills and pretty lights\\, you'll probably love this movie. If you like your movies to have some semblance of sense and depth\\, and if you're looking for continuity from the originals\\, prequels\\, or even episode 7 and expect this movie to uphold the long established lore of the Star Wars universe\\, like me\\, you'll likely fucking hate it.","true":true}
