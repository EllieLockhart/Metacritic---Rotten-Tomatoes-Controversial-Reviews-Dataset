Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went home and had to really think about what I just watched. The movie wasn't boring. It was just a complete disaster. Rian Johnson left me going WTF just happened??? WTF did I just watched??? Rian Johnson needs to stop making movies.","true":true}
