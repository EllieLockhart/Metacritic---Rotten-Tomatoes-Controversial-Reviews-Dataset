Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an amazing chapter in the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson's adaptation takes Star Wars into the next generation.\\n\\n[Spoiler Alert]\\n\\nThe people that don't like Luke's personality have an interesting point\\, I would counter-argue that in life we have ups and downs\\, Luke clearly is experiencing a low at the beginning of the film. And it's not until Yoda smacks him straight\\, \\\"failure is the ultimate teacher.\\\" does Luke get back to his badassery. Those stuck on Luke as a jerk\\, aren't considering the lulls we all go through in life (and are fighting change in general).\\n\\nThe second biggest compliant I'd like to address is the recurring small jokes\\, and bland\\, predictable\\, and basic scripting at times. There is truth to this...  Luke had bad lines at time. Rey had basic lines at times. Leia\\, Finn\\, Ren... they all had plain\\, luke warm lines at time. This is 100% something Johnson should not repeat. It was just bad at times.But let me pose this question to you - It ruined the entire movie? In the greater scheme of things\\, does this ruin the overall brilliant storyline? No\\, not in my opinion. \\n\\nTo add perspective: My favorite SW movie is Empire\\, followed by Return of the Jedi. I'm an avid fan... AND I can handle change. Star Wars is in the right hands... JJ does need to clean a few things up in the last movie\\, but Rian's effort is my third favorite movie and it's hands down better than the force awakens.","true":true}
