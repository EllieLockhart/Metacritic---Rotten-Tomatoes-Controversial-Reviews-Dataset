Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved Star Wars as a kid (whatever the first 3 are now called) and I've seen all the rest since then because of my kids. Some of it is passable entertainment and some of it not (the jar jar binks one for example). This was just terrible. It was too loud to sleep through and unbearably long and boring. I'm just dumbfounded that anyone other than a child could find this entertaining.","true":true}
