Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie broke too many rules of Star Wars and by doing so it created plot holes. Why didn't the Jedi in the prequels ever project themselves? Why didn't they control lightsabers with the force? Why didn't the rebels or clones ever use kamikaze light speed ships during the clone wars or to destroy the Death Stars? Why can force ghost use the force to affect the living? The list goes on and on and not just with plot holes. Plain bad writing across the board.","true":true}
