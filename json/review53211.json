Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better as a stand alone movie when you include the inclusiveness and begin\/end to a story.  This movie was horrible for the franchise.  How could Disney let one movie completely deconstruct what was created.  I'm okay if you want to create a whole new movie and concept\\, but since this is Star Wars and not Peasant Force Wars\\, I'm pretty upset they could not find a way to progress the story instead of destroying it.","true":true}
