Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie attempts to do too many things; incorporating the old with the new\\, touching on many themes\\, and taking the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster ride.  In the end\\, the main reason to watch it is to say you've watched the first 8 episodes.","true":true}
