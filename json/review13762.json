Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If not one of the worst movies I've ever watched\\, this is definitely the worst Star Wars. There's no mystery\\, no fear\\, no soul - it feels like a bunch of weird scenes just thrown together. The writing is immature\\, corny\\, confusing and boring. The villains aren't intimidating\\, the heroes aren't inspiring. It's shot and edited very strangely. There are too many moments which lack context\\, explanation or reason to mention. I'm no massive SW fan\\, but this movie missed the mark in so many ways I'm amazed it made it out of the editing room and onto the big screen.","true":true}
