Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[SPOILER WARNING]: In general\\, it is always nice to subvert the expectations of the audience once and a while. It's nice to have some unpredictability in your films\\, the audience can be drawn in as they can't necessarily predict what will happen next. However\\, when you are doing nothing but throwing curveballs at the audience\\, it will eventually stop being special\\, and come full circle to being predictable again. What I'm trying to say here is that killing your mysterious and seemingly all-powerful villain halfway through the movie\\, killing one of your main characters before they receive any development at all\\, having a rebel leader act like an incompetent leader only to have a super secret plan to warp into a star destroyer. It really all comes across as an over-reaction to criticism that The Force Awakens wasn't original enough\\, so they tried to force in as many twists as they could possibly think of. It is an exaggeration to say that The Last Jedi is a truly \\\"bad\\\" film\\, it's not\\, the acting is generally quite good\\, well executed and polished actions scenes\\, it's just kind of boring and doesn't really contribute anything to the overall series\\, and based on many of the main characters being dead\\, may actually be detrimental to it.","true":true}
