Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"pathetically shallow characters\\, moronic social justice themes\\, a plethora of plot holes and any potential drama is constantly undermined by cringy subversive humor or bullshit. A complete disservice to the Star Wars canon.","true":true}
