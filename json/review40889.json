Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie definitely exceeded my expectations! I was concerned that the film would rehash everything we had already seen but it turned out to go in new directions. While there were some strange moments\\, I find this a movie that is perfect for Star Wars fans who want something new.","true":true}
