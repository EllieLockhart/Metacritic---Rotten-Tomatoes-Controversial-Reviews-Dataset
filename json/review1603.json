Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of the Star Wars movies and expanded universe I went into this expecting to be disappointed but have a good time. I didn't expect to be this disappointed though. The writer seems to have no real understanding of the Star Wars fandom or universe and creates too many plot lines\\, many of which go nowhere. Things that ought to have been explained were not and vice versa. Some scenes and sequences were spectacularly done but beyond those few this movie lacks anything particularly memorable. It tries hard to be the new Empire Strikes Back but frankly ends up ranking below even Phantom Menace in this fan's opinion. It pains me greatly that this is the new canon and all future material must adhere to it.","true":true}
