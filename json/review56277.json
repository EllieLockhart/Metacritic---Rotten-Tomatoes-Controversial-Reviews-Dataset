Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible script\\, plot wholes everywhere\\, characters are a mess\\, story arcs that go nowhere. Yet because there was a few good gags and action scenes the critics love it?! Now I loved some of Rian Johnson's other movies\\, but this was just a badly written script on so many levels. It's not bold or creative to have a plot that doesn't make sense and characters that go nowhere and act illogically. I guess most critics are just journalist grads that have never worked on a film or book\\, or know anything about the fundamentals of story-telling.","true":true}
