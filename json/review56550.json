Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has its highs and lows but mostly highs. The Casino scene seems a little unnecessary and adds length to an already long movie. Some of the lore is discarded and some characters receive a rather unsatisfying ending. Adam Driver does an excellent job as a conflicted Kylo Ren. i enjoyed the dichotomy between him and Rey. I am unsure which direction the third film will go in as this film left me not invested in the characters. This wasnt the theatrical miracle that I longed for but all in all it was a flawed but enjoyable film.","true":true}
