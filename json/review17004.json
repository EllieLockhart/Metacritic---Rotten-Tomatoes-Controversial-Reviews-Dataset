Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't get why people have so much to complain about. Yeah\\, there were some moments that were a bit much for me\\, like the 'infamous' Leia Superman scene\\, but all in all\\, I enjoyed the film thoroughly. The film didn't take itself too seriously\\, all the duels were entertaining and exhilarating\\, and most of all\\, it tried new things. Some of those new things worked while others didn't\\, which is normal\\, and considering how conservative and audience-conscious recent Star Wars films have been\\, Last Jedi is a welcome change. I can't wait to see how they kill the past and build something new from here.","true":true}
