Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have to say it was a reality shock when I played the game\\, naughty dog \u200b\u200breally made me realize that not everything is a fairy tale where there is a hero who does everything right and saves the world in the end\\, she really did a good job demonstrating how cruel the world can be\\, I always waited for a different ending with joel and ellie together\\, but that wasn\u2019t it\\, that made the game more real\\, the real reason ellie didn\u2019t kill abby wasn\u2019t because of a moral lesson but because she realized that revenge only generates more revenge. the gameplay is almost the same as 1 but improved in everythingEven though the game was incredible there were some bad points like: * artificial intelligence\\, honestly naughty dog \u200b\u200bpromised something revolutionary but ended up making the intelligence end up being a little laggy * the game makes my ps4 look like an airplane turbine\\, if you don't have a ps4 pro\\, know that the game suffers from some bugs like flashing textures and framerate drop * They focused a lot on humans\\, it really is not a big problem since the gameplay is good and brings incredible moments but the game forgot that they are in an apocalypse with a lot of infected * Items are not scarce\\, they promised more immersion in the game but it helps you at all times\\, when I played I always had a full inventory because I thought so many * The difficulty\\, both ellie and abby are super sodiers\\, they can take 50 shots and still stay alive\\, that takes away some of the realism even though the game had some errors it was a good game\\, maybe not the best of the year but one of the best\u2026 Expand","true":true}
