Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I now understand why Mark Hamill was so vocal about his character. He said\\, he completely disagreed with Rian\u2019s direction he took with Luke Skywalker and so do I. It\u2019s clear Rian Johnson didn\u2019t care at all about the direction JJ Abraham\u2019s set up in Force Awakens. It feels like he knew nothing of the Star Wars story at all. He just did his own thing and in my opinion failed completely. Very disappointed in how they made Luke\u2019s character seem like he cared about nothing and just wanted to die? Lazy writing as a whole with this film.","true":true}
