Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney took my childhood out behind the woodshed and shot it in between the eyes. Trash plot. Trash new characters. Trash dismissal of great characters. Trash trash trash!!! They took this saga in a Terrible direction","true":true}
