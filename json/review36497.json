Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie concentrated on making beautify scenery and finding ways to jerk emotions out of the audiences. In doing so\\, it completely deviated from the star wars saga....it was a huge finger for the old fans and eye candy for mindless audiences. I'm done with star wars. ","true":true}
