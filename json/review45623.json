Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very disappointing. What I expected in the movie \\\"the last Jedi\\\"\\, was a good fight in real life with kylo in person. Then after a good fight with kylo\\, luke would like Obiwan\\, disappears to the light. By not killing Kylo. \\n\\nit would have been really nice if he could really stop the laser or reflect from the walker with his forces in person and not a hologram. It would have been nice that he would be stronger than kylo\\, but would not want to kill him or cut him half like obiwan did to vader and chooses for the light and disappears to help ray with his spirit\/ghost form. It would be also very cool if Ray could not lift the rocks and luke would help her as a ghost to lift it. also teaches her further with her power.\\n\\nthis is more my opinion and just expected more and want to see his strength. Waited hole my life to see luke.I am just disappointed.?","true":true}
