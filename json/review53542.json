Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every critic of the new trilogy that I have read seems to be missing the same fundamental point: Star Wars is not\\, and never was Science Fiction. The Saga begins with the equivalent of \\\"Once Upon a Time\\\". The story is about Knights and old Wizards. To apply the logic of hard SciFi to Star Wars is missing the spirit of the series\\, which has always had more in common with mythology and legend than hard science. Parallels\\, unlikely coincidences and repetition is a big part of the language of that kind of story. Taken in that spirit\\, this addition is a poignant and touching addition to that legend\\, providing plenty of unexpected turns while still paying tribute to the beloved canon and paving the way for this saga to complete\\, while at the same time paving the way for new stories with other voices to continue on after the Skywalkers. I will concede to critics that complain of a touch too many disney-esque gags\\, I would have been fine with these if there were simply a few less of them. This has also always been a part of the lexicon. And to take issue with the balance feels like quibbling in the face of this lovingly executed chapter that has earned its place in the saga.","true":true}
