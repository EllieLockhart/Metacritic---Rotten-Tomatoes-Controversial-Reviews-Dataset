Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"terrible terrible movie..i hated it..this isnt luke skywalker We Know with cheesy 1 liners and drinking alien tit milk...stupid CGI Marry Poppins Princess Leia  flying thru space stupid las vegas casino and dumb plot ..just chasing the rebel cruiser until they run out of fuel..BB8 is driving a scout walker..i mean you cant make this stuff up  its so stupid","true":true}
