Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie want at all what I expected\\, I really enjoyed it. It's a movie that challenges the characters and doesn't reward then easily. In fact\\, one of the most hated scenes is one where a character seems to suceed far too easily and unexpectedly. However\\, this movie also dismiss a lot of the mysteries set up in the last film. So if you were waiting 2 years to learn more about Snoke\\, or the knights of Ren\\, you'll be disappointed. But then again\\, star wars has always saved some back story for expanded universe venues\\, so I'm willing to forgive that.","true":true}
