The story is pretty good although it was poorly written and didn't have an interesting narrative compared to previous naughty dog games. All of their games since uncharted 1 till uncharted lost legacy (includes last of us) have all had good writting and interesting narrative wich is why those were well received and is what made fall in love withI finally finished playing last of us 2.

All of their games since uncharted 1 till uncharted lost legacy (includes last of us) have all had good writting and interesting narrative wich is why those were well received and is what made fall in love with Nauhty Dog games. If this game had better writting and proper execution\\, this game would have been better. Like I said this game has a good story which touches upon some good and complex themes\\, but only poorly written with less interesting narrative. I respect them for trying something completly different instead of making and following the huge of success of the first game. People are hating on this game for only a single plot element and should ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME.  Overall\\, this isn't near to the perfection of the first last of us\\, but its still a good game. I mean not everyone can give out a perfect game each time and naughty dog is no exception and there will be times where they can disapoint which is ok. I still felt slightly disappointed\\, since I have been hyped for this game back in psx 2016 but I'm sure they won't disapoint with their next game. My rating for last of us 2 is an 8\/10. This rating mght seem good\\, but for me naughty dog's range is atleast a 9 to truly deliver. Moving to the technical aspects\\, the ghraphics are stunning and beautiful and its easily the best and realistic looking game I have ever played.  The acting and facial animations are exellent and the sound designing is so realistic and great. The gameplay is far more improved in this game\\, there are many new mechanics that were added which adds another layer to the gameplay. I really enjoyed the gameplay\\, it was fluid\\, realistic and really fun. This time the AI is much more improved making the encounters more challenging and you have to be more stategic to approach them. There are so many small details that are just crazy to see. In brief\\, its a technical masterpiece and they put **** ton of effort in making this game and few reports say this game costed them at least 100 million to make. They pushed the boundaries of gaming and I can't imagine how their games will look on PS5.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
