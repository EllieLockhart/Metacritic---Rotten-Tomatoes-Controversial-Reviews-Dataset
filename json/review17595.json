Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I specifically made an account on this site to comment on this movie and the reviews I see about this movie. The past week I see lots of 5 star ratings and that made me think. Why so much 5 star ratings? So i did some igging. What do all past week  5 star rating reviews have in common? they all subscribed to RT this month. So my gues is these are bots or payed people to write positive reviews. \\n\\nNow about the movie. The movie looks awesome\\, the music is awesome\\, the visuals are awesome\\, but the story is a slap in the face for any star wars fan. Internet is full of stories how this movie broke the Star Wars franchise\\, look it up.","true":true}
