{"101487":196635,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While ostensibly a continuation of an existing universe this film and the previous incarnation attempt to \\\"reboot\\\" the universe by retrying what has already been done in the original trilogy. The plot for this movie is borrowed from Empire Strikes Back\\, one of the most beloved films in the series\\, but it eschews any attempt at logic or structure to try and get the characters to where the story envisions them. The utter nonsensical and baffling turn of events is not even consistent within the singular movie\\, let alone in the wider universe in which it is set. For example\\, the Resistance Fleet (read rebranded Rebels) are fleeing the First Order (read rebranded Imperials) who are waiting for the ships to run out of gas so they can pick them off. Ignoring the OJ Simpson White Bronco chase premise\\, we then have two characters get in a ship and jump out of the system in an awkward and politically charged capitalism refutation. If we ignore the many problems we are already passing over we are still left with the very real fact that the First Order did not pursue their ship leaving the fleet. So... could they have sent out more of them? Could they have just placed their most important people onto that ship and never returned? Let's move past this. The main character played by Daisy Ridley is off for her training with Luke Skywalker\\, The Last Jedi. Except\\, again\\, they do not train. By the time Rey leaves we have found out that Luke likes to contemplate murdering his own sleeping nephew like a psychopath and that he drinks weird milk from some sea cow. Rey\\, setting off to save the day\\, arrives to face the most powerful force user in the galaxy with still no idea how to use then force or swing a lightsaber etc. Think about that! This is a Galaxy where literally thousands of Jedi could not do what she does\\, and they had the Jedi Order and a lifetime of training and perfecting their skills. Ok\\, so she's must have some of that super sweet Skywalker blood or something\\, and we will get a big reveal? Nope\\, she's born of drifters who sold her to buy booze and die in the desert. (Clearly this is simply a red herring so that JJ can have his \\\"Rey\\, I'm your mother!\\\" line in episode 9 that we aren't supposed to see coming... so shhhh!) okay\\, so we are again supposed to be taken in by the \\\"risks\\\" the director took by so breaking with the movies that came before that the final battle doesn't take place on a frozen world like Hoth\\, no\\, it's an ice world that shimmers like snow. Okay\\, well at least they've had 30 years to make new vehicles right?! Nope\\, they are the same vehicles from 1970s but this time with an extra hump on their back. Okay\\, well at least in a Star Wars Film there will be a lightsaber Battle right? No\\, Luke will show up and stand there while his nephew does his best to kill him\\, only to find out that alike never left his dirty little island\\, and in fact\\, he's now going to die. Having done what? Oh well he stood there and that sent a message to the galaxy to \\\"light the fires of resistance.\\\" Wait\\, I thought that the new guys were part of the government that formed after the Imperials were defeated. Nope. They were but weren't defeated\\, left the galaxy\\, stole a bunch of kids\\, changed their name and got a big ugly dude to lead them and then came back\\, wiped out the leader of the legitimate government in the slaughter of 7 whole world's... but we need Luke to show up as a hologram to light the fire under peoples asses. What?!? You mean people stood by while they destroyed billions of lives and now they are gonna come because some guy nobody has seen in years didn't show up? Oh and he's dead now too\\, along with every other member o cyber resistance except like 10 people on the millennium falcon. Seriously\\, this is the best they could come up with? Have they never talked to an actual fan? Do they just want to write it with the same level of competency of a middle school writing class? \\n\\nDon't watch this movie. Don't support this movie. Send the message to those in charge of these things that the movie is an utter waste of time and complete rubish.","true":true}
