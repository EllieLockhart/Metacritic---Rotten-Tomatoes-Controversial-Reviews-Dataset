Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've created this account on RT just to say that this movie is fundamentally flawed and is a bad movie. Worst off it's an awful and boring Star Wars movie. Too much comedy\\, invented plot devices just to get the moving going\\, a lack of respect for the movies that came before it\\, and did I mention it's boring? It torches all the previous movies and barley connects to The Force Awakens. The movie that came RIGHT before it. It's a betrayal of the Star Wars saga. And it's fans.","true":true}
