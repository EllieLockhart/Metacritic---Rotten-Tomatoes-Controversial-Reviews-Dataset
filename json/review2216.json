Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first viewing\\, you are shocked so you don't think it's good. A second viewing reveals all the layers and explanations for apparent plot holes. It's not perfect movie but mark my words\\, 10 years from now\\, when people will be saying it is the best Star Wars movie\\, even better than Empire. The same thing happened with Empire.\\nThe mark of a good movie is that it makes you feel something and stays with you even after you have left the theatre. It's been a week and I still can't get over Luke.","true":true}
