Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointment. The plot is all over the place but goes nowhere. Everything is resolved by contrived coincidence. Finn and Rose subplot accomplishes nothing; take them out of the movie and nothing changes\\, except maybe a happier ending. Legacy of Luke's character is completely tarnished; he acts out of character for the sake of driving the plot. Snoke died in the most anticlimactic and cliche way for someone who's supposedly the big bad. Disney's blatant attempt to advertise merchandise by introducing load of out-of-place animals and robots does not help this movie one bit. The humor is awkward and cringey with terrible timing. Just awful.","true":true}
