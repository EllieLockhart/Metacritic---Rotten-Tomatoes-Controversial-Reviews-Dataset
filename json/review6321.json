Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney managed to gut the star wars series in one movie\\, they not only managed that with the lame jokes. Poor flow of story line\\, but in the re-use of scenes barely re framed from the original movies. That made up the entire film! i hope they can some how manage to come back from the disaster they have made the series. Yet i doubt they can\\, RIAN JOHNSON wrote the worst star wars movie to date. If they allow him to write another one it is a horrible choice. The dialouge in the film\\, and even the plot line were horrible\\, i could keep going but i think any true star wars fan or even film critque would notice the same things. I have been a devoted fan for close to 30 years. Well they have managed to completly ruin that along with the star wars name. Lucas films worst decision ever was to sell to disney and allow them to cannonize and gut Star Wars how they have. Good luck to them and i think to only use left for any star wars anything produced by disney is to lite a fire.","true":true}
