Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing story line to the star wars universe \\, made Luke look like a coward \\, story development too slow for such a long runtime \\, as a star wars fan that has loved every single release related to that universe \\, i now say that this movie has ruined star wars for me","true":true}
