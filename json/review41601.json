Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is getting universal praise by critics\\, and It's solely because it's Disney. Just further proof Disney has bought off critics. \\n\\nYOu think Disney doesn't have that power? We saw the crazy demands they made of businesses to even allow theaters to screen this trash movie. My guess is those demands were made BECAUSE they knew this movie was bad.\\n\\nRipped off Empire and Jedi. After all of the speculation about Rey's parents and who Snoke is\\, Disney and Rian Johnson SPIT in everyone's face by having Snoke go out easy and not be anyone\\, and Rey's big parent reveal rip off from Empire was lame. \\\"Your parents were junkers who sold you.\\\" WOW....So amazing!!! SO much better than Empire!!! Yes\\, that was sarcasm.\\n\\nI don't know why critics just refuse to acknowledge any problems in the Disney Star Wars movies. Just like the MCU. Crap is being smeared across the screen\\, and because it's Disney critics will give bad movies stellar reviews\\, my guess is because they're scared Disney will revoke their early access or something.\\n\\nTHis movie sucked. Why are we supposed to care about Episode 9? Kylo Ren can't beat Rey. They have bashed us over the head with that fact with how easy everything is for that Mary Sue\\, so we already know her beating him is going to be super easy. Why do we need another movie after this garbage?\\n\\nThe Leia in space part was so cringey I busted out laughing\\, and the Star Wars nerds all got triggered that I was making fun of the \\\"emotional\\, deep\\, and thought-provoking moment.\\\" \\n\\nLuke died\\, meaning that all of the evil straight-white men that George Lucas introduced are gone now\\, so now the PC Parade introduced by Jar Jar Abrams is all that's left with their lame characters and horrible acting from the lead actress.\\n\\nDaisey Ridley was horrible. Her line delivery was even more wooden than Chris Evans and Scarlet Johanson in the MCU.\\n\\nI'd say pass it up\\, but Star Wars fans will eat up anything if Mickey Mouse is tied to it in some way.","true":true}
