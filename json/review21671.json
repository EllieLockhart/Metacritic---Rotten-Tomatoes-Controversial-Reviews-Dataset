Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a hot mess. From cringey lines to shoddy editing and scenes that seem to be ripped straight from Empire\\, the film relies on its high self-regard and fandom to carry it through. Barely watchable. Some nice visual work in the battle shots but otherwise a very recycled and tired soapbox of disney-esq social commentary projected onto the corpse of the original trilogy.","true":true}
