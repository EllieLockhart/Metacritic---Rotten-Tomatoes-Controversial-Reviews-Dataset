Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**SPOILER FREE**  Rian Johnson is a fan who grew up to become a filmmaker who ended up making a Star Wars film that deconstructs the mythos of a galaxy far\\, far away while making it anew. You'll walk out of the theater remembering why you loved these films in the first place\\, even if you're disappointed with the entire Canto Bight sequence.","true":true}
