Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Sequal I've ever seen litterally signed up to post this as i think it needs to be said. Pointless subplots\\, really bad character building for the new characters and terrible character progression from the old faces. If you like the original movies you will be sorely dissapointed - even my 7 year old said \\\"this is boring\\\"","true":true}
