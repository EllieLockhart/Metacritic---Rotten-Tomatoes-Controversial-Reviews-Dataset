Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Read the rave reviews on here with care they sound.... robotic....\\n\\nThe movie itself felt like they shoehorned a bunch of characters that's were there to make Disney look good. Critics must have seen a different movie than I did.\\n\\nWhat I saw was a mashup of Empire Strikes Back and Speed. The question I have for Ryan Johnson is why didn't anyone GO GET GAS?!?","true":true}
