Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without a single doubt in my mind this is the worst Star Wars movie. I don't have words to describe the damage this piece of flaming garbage did to such a beloved and incredible series. The only thing you need to know is that my father\\, a man who has loved Star Wars since he was 18 years old and saw the opening scrawl of a New Hope slide across the screen\\, has repeatedly said that the Last Jedi ruined Star Wars for him.","true":true}
