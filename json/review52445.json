Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie with a few flaws\\, but come on it\u2019s Star Wars! Loved the ending. Loved the cinematography. Loved a little bit of humor. Overall it was a lot of fun and a great night out. ","true":true}
