Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: A lot of plot holes\\, wasted opportunities\\, and character assassination of Luke's character. Rey is stronger than Luke with almost no training. Finn meets Rose and goes on a pointless mission. Leia floats through the vacuum of space and doesn't die\\, even though it would have made sense because Carrie Fisher (RIP) passed away during post-production. The Knights of Ren are gone and its never explained what happened to them. Are they Snoke's bodyguards? Who knows? Poe becomes a dumb stereotypical \\\"male rebel\\\" character. They never explain how Snoke brought Kylo to the dark side\\, didn't explain how Kylo killed Luke's students. Luke try's to kill Kylo or (Been Solo) in his sleep even though Luke almost died to prove that there was good in Darth Vader. Rey's parents are nobodies. Didn't explain how or why Rey hears voices from Obi-Wan and see's visions from Lukes 1st battle with Vader\\, in the Force Awakens when she touches Luke's Lightsaber. Luke sends a projection of himself to fight Kylo so the rebels can escape\\, but even though he just projects an image of himself he still dies? I could go on but these were the big ones. This movie disappointed a lot of fans. Also hated the fact that Finn is supposed to be an Important character for blacks (because I'm an African-American Male) and He is a useless character. But whatever I'm just another \\\"Fan Boy\\\" according to the producers.","true":true}
