Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this movie as well as The Force Awakens. While it did not go they most fans thought it would\\, or should\\, it was plenty entertaining and kept me interested the entire time. Disney has taken the steps to make the new movies their own\\, which disappoints some fans. Some are upset about no long training period for Rey to get her force powers. As an old school fan I would say that today's younger audiences do not have the patience to wait 3 movies for a new Jedi to develop. Disney is trying to please the most fans\\, and especially the ones buying the most toys\\, which is the younger audiences. We'll see how the next movie goes. My favorites remain Empire and then Rogue One\\, but I am old school.","true":true}
