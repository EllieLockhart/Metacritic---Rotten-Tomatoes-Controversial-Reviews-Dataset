Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The better part of the plot is pointless and inconsequential\\, dialogue ranges from serviceable to cringy\\, humour isn\u00b4t very good and kills the mood\\, and barely anything changes from the start of the film to the end. Some of the action is quite fun\\, but there isn\u00b4t a whole lot.","true":true}
