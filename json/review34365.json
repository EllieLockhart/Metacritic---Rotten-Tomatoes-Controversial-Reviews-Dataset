Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bad guy in this movie was an unnamed arms dealer selling weapons to both sides. The good guys were the racing animals that get freed\\, leaving the slave children behind to fend for themselves. Star cruisers run out of fuel. The only heros are blue-haired feminists. Men engage in \\\"your-mom\\\" jokes. Living Jedis can now project themselves impossible distances and fool the beholder into thinking they are present. No one ever answers the question of who Snoke is\\, or how the first order came to be. THIS MOVIE RUINED STAR WARS!","true":true}
