Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"TLOU is one of my most beloved and favourite games because of the story and relationship between Joel & Ellie. I avoided all the leaked spoilers\\, negative criticism on the game so I can experience it for myself and make up my own judgement. However\\, I am disappointed with ND here\u2019s why. I played the game and completed it in 4 days straight (do not recommend it) it took me on an up & down journey (Mostly down) from beginning to end\\, lots of flashbacks\\, confusing story\\, misleading trailers to get the fans to buy the game\\, no character development\\, or clear message\\, pointless tasks\\, uncharacteristic choices\\, no real care or connection to any of the new characters introduced\\, more than half the game you play as Abby to try and get us to understand and sympathize\\, when no one really wanted that.I can understand where the director was trying to take the story but it was done poorly\\, even someone with an open mind could see this. The characters they said they hold close and dear to their hearts & would do right by the fans they completely ruined.  One thing I cant deny is the graphics are incredible\\, and the accessibility of game play.  If only they had put more work into the story than they did for the visuals. No matter how beautiful the visuals are\\, it was hard to enjoy this game. At end of it\\, I felt mentally and physically distraught\\, no real accomplishment or impact from the game like it had in the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
