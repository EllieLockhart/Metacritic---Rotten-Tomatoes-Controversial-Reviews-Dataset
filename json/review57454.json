Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not what I was expecting or hoping for.  I am a Star Wars fan of 20+ years\\, since I was a kid.  I am not blind to what is happening in our everyday lives in terms of progressive-minded people\\, and for the most part\\, I am in league with them.   That being said\\, I feel like that way of thinking was taken too far\\, and it's just a shame that it had to cheapen such a beloved franchise in the process","true":true}
