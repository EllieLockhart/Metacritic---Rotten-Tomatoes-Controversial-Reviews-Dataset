Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truthfully...I liked the movie...I have never in the history of RT a discrepancy between the fans and the critics on a movie that\u00e2(TM)s so critically acclaimed! I mean 93% RT and 56% fans?!!! Justice League was 40% RT and 80% fans! This is unheard of! The movie has its flaws. Like deserved better and we needed more back story of Finn\\, Rey\\, Snoke. Hope we get that in Episode 9.","true":true}
