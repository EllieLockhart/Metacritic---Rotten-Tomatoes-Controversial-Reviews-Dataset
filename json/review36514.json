Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie did NOT follow the original 1978\\, 1980 & 1983 plot themes (even the prequels and Awakening) followed the story of the Jedi family. It was a horrible conclusion to a generational saga first witnessed and beloved by many as our very 1st sci-fi movie. \u2639","true":true}
