Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful movie as it should be just from production costs. The story is terrible. The movie is nonsensical\\, inconsistent\\, boring canon breaking\\, terrible physics\\, full if incompetent people that act completely out of character for a Star Wars movie. I could go on for pages listing ridiculous actions & simply stupid plot points. The movie starts with the dreadnaught firing at the base when it should of destroyed the  resistances cruiser. During the chase several ships run out of fuel & get destroyed when they could of done what is ABSOLUTELY WORST THING EVER THE HYPERSPACE RAM. The entire Canto Bight B plot is pointless\\, VA Holdo is just stupid\\, uncalled for & a chance to ram in a woman character when Admiral Akbar would of been much better. Finn dragging Rose 3 miles after she rammed him on Crait & somehow they aren't shot. Rey & her triple kill on crait\\, how did she get to crait\\, the vanishing weapon when praetorian guard has Rey in it grasp\\, Leia does a mMary Poppins even thought the ship should of flown past her instantly\\, they're all joyous at the end when everyone's basically dead..its just a dumb dumb dumb badly written movie that treats Luke Skywalker like crap\\, rams in women characters just because\\, a boring space chase that just sucks. Disney needs to get this s#*t together. When i dont want to use internet data i watch a star wars movie or cartoon series; they're on my local server. TLJ is the only Star Wars movie I honestly cant watch. I have to skip most of TLJ in my \\\"Head Cannon\\\" otherwise I'd star to dislike the series. Im 48 & love Star Wars. I really like the prequel series very much too. I liked TFA as a reintroduction to the series for young people but TLJ is just that bad & the Hyperspace Ram is a real problem for me. I have an engineering degree & get force\\, mass\\, velocity\\, acceleration & I really hope Lucasfilm figures out some type of explanation as to why & how the ram was successful. Otherwise I'll always be thinking \\\"strap a Hyperspace engine to a ship or asteroid & ram it\\\". Its a bad movie people its BAD. ","true":true}
