Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Upping my personal movie rating score to out of 5 stars now to match RT. Almost a perfect Star Wars movie\\, except for one character's trip to a planet mid-movie that seemed to slow things up. The stakes have never been higher in a Star Wars movie\\, keeping you on the edge of your seat\\, and a completely unpredictable movie as well. I wouldn't say twists\\, that implies the story makes a complete 180 turn\\, just that the story doesn't go the way we've been trained to expect blockbuster movies to go ... and that's a very good thing. Very good performance by Mark Hamill\\, while love seeing Daisy Ridley as Rey.","true":true}
