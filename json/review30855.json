Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So bad. Everytime it looked like there might be a good scene\\, it was ruined by a terrible decision by Rian Johnson's asinine script. The whole thing with Luke...So stupid. This movie was prequel bad. In fact episode 3 was better. Never thought I would say that. Don't waste your time or money.  I know I won't for episode 9.","true":true}
