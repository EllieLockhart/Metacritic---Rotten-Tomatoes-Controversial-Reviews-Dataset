Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the hype. Not the hate hype. Not the love hype. The Last Jedi is a good film. But it's not a masterpiece. And it's certainly not the best or worst Star Wars film ever made either. It has some seriously amateur pacing problems. It tries to be all things to all people but fails fairly spectacularly in achieving any of things. I can see why people love it. It is very different both in content and style\/ It does take a lot of risks and it is a complete middle finger to much of the previous canon. I can also see why folks hate it and I won't bother going over that ground. What it failed to do most of all for me is make me feel like a kid again (or to inspire my own child in the way the other films have). This is the biggest disappointment of all. In being a bit too clever and complex it has not only exploded the series as a whole (that's not the worst thing) but it's snuffed out a lot of the magic. The Star Wars galaxy used to be an escape from the real world. In becoming more of a reflection of the real world it has become diminished.","true":true}
