Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan that has even appreciated TFA\\, this movie was a pain in my heart. Complete betrayal to the character of Luke\\, extreme cuts from different plot lines (Finn plot line completely pointless except from a cheap critique to the 1% and showing a force sensitive kid). Rey is overpowered with just less than a day total of training and so on\\, I'm even tired of thinking about this movie... it makes me physically ill","true":true}
