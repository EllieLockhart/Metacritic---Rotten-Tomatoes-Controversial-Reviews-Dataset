Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much Ma-Rey-sue. Trying to rewrite all the highlights of the original just to cash grab on the nostalgia without realizing the foundation and buildup the original had making the moments actually impactful.  And wassup with the bullshit subtext that old people\/characters are dumb and useless so let's just kill old fan favorites and start with a clean slate? To be fair the latter happened in originals\\, but not. as pointlessly and quick. I imagine some of the actors probably wanted out after they realized they were contractually obligated to ruin the characters they loved and put their career into (sorry Hamill\\, and you're not wrong in disliking the direction). Horrible pacing\\, forced jokes with bad timing\\, illogical scenes (how do they breathe in space no prob?)\\, too many convenient plot contrivances. Insulting to any original star wars fans. How many times are people gonna buy into the shameless rehashes. Star Wars is dead\\, Disney is just reanimating the corpse and people are paying to watch.","true":true}
