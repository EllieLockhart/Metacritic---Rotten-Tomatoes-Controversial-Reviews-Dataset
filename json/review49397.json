Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Was movie every. One pointless storyline and the rest of it is turned into a Disney kids movie with stupid jokes and ignoring the buildup questions from the last movie. It's embarrassing. If you're a Star Wars fan you'll hate it. If you don't know much about Star Wars\\, sure you'll like it as an entertaining movie.","true":true}
