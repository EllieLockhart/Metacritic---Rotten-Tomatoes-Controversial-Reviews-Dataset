Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"George Lucas Star Wars created a world in a galaxy far away and you could imagine Luke and everyone still being alive somewhere after their adventure had been told. It is a bit like Peter Pan and Neverland where you could go if you had a space ship that could fly there. Nu-Star Wars is about the real world\\, it doesn't even take you off the ground\\, it's all grounded in modern politics on planet earth.","true":true}
