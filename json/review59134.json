Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is so stunning!! It\u2019s really one of the best games I have played. Made me cry a lot of times as well :D Sooo many little details (as expected from Naughty Dog) and really beautiful characters\/world. I didn\u2019t see any of the leaks\\, so I went in totally blind. Not gonna lie\\, I was scared what will happen because I heard people didn\u2019t like the ending. I think it was perfect though. **maybe a mild spoiler here**I didn\u2019t even know that we will play as Abby. First I was like \\\"I\u2019m not gonna play as this **** but after some hours I started to like her\/her story and her friends as well.**okay that was it**You can\u2019t really compare this game to The last of us part I\\, because they were made 7 years apart\\, and have completely different themes. I totally recommend this game to everyone.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
