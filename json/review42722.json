Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was GREAT. As someone who grew up with the Original Trilogy\\, and have loved star wars since I could talk this movie hit on so many different levels. The force is back to being an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us\\, penetrates us\\, and binds the galaxy together. Not what your expecting but everything you want. My inner child was so giddy throughout this whole movie! Go see it!!","true":true}
