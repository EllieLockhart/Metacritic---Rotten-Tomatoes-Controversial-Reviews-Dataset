Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this movie doesn't even deserve the half star I give it. The fact that this movie has a 92% critic score is blasphemy and really begs the question \\\"Are the critics really watching the same thing I just watched?\\\". I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life and I grew up with the prequels. I can't say enough how much I love Star Wars. They're my favorite movies of all time. This destroys everything we love about Star Wars. I could write pages on everything wrong with this movie\\, but I don't feel it necessary\\, as many problems I have with it have already been voiced throughout the Star Wars community. Disney has fucked up big time with this one. So bad that as of now I'm not going to see the next one. May the force be with you JJ\\, you're gonna need it to somehow make episode 9.","true":true}
