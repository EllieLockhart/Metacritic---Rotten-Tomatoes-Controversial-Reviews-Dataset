We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Really fantastic game! Naughty Dog did it again and they still are my favorite developer. The gameplay is very entertaining\\, the AI is smart\\, you always have to move and think ahead.The graphics are top notch\\, the best facial expressions and (voice) acting\\, ligthing\\, textures\\,....Everything has super high production values and the attention to detail is unpar.\rThe audio is incredible\\, you really have to hear this in surround: you can hear which direction the enemy is\\, the enemies shout commands or are in shock when a comrade dies and they even shout their name.\rThe Story is 10\/10. Ok it's depressing. Joel does but he sometimes comes back in flashbacks so he's not really dead\\, the game wants to tell you that Ellie will always remember him. The game wants Joel to die because it wants you to feel the same anger as Ellie. Ellie has now a cause why she wants to take you on a revenge trip. But the killer Abby also becomes the main character and this is a very bold but smart move of Naughty Dog. The game wants to tell you that there is no good or evil. Ellie has her reasons to kill Abby\\, because she killed her father figure: Joel. But Joel killed Abby's father!!! So Abby also had a good reason to kill Joel. We learn from Abby's past that she's not evil but just wants her revenge just like Ellie ..... It's an interesting change of perspective which I like. The end was weird but interesting\\, you play as Abby who wants to kill Ellie... And later on you play as Ellie who wants to kill Abby. In the end you are not cheering that someone wins\\, you want them both live and go their seperate ways. Who wins? Ellie? Abby? Nobody? You have to play the game. Just do it\\, keep an open mind and enjoy. Also check out on Youtube: Girlfriend reviews and their video: 'understanding Last Of Us  2\\\" . After this you understand it better\\, they really nailed it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
