Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I preface this with\\, I LOVE Star Wars! But TLJ is by far\\, the worst Star Wars movie ever! Plot holes\\, poor writing\\, poor editing\\, no meaningful relationships\\, and no character development. Kylo Ren is easily the worst villain ever- like a pouty teenager meets every cliche B-movie bad guy. He and Leia didn't even have a single interaction. The big reveal for Rae's parents was stupid. Even the fake looking birds and fake looking crystal dogs were sub-par for Star Wars standards. Stoke was a cartoon version of the emperor and he went down like a wet fish. Leia floating in space and was dumb because it led to nothing. Luke's story was most disappointing. Not epic-more like an epic fail! ","true":true}
