Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Speaking as a life-long Star Wars fan (I watched A New Hope in 1977 as a 6-year-old)\\, I don\u2019t understand what everyone is so upset about. This was a fun movie. Entertaining\\, original\\, and unexpected. No\\, it didn\u2019t answer every question I had\\, and yes\\, I have a few complaints. But\\, you know what? If they let me write the script\\, everyone would still complain. I loved seeing some of my favorite characters\\, and I was thrilled to share Star Wars with my son\\, who is now 12. He loved it. Let\u2019s just enjoy this one for what it is\\, a thrilling movie with a good story and exciting plot turns. Maybe you need to ask yourself\\, \u201cAre my expectations too high?\u201d Lighten up\\, don\u2019t think so hard\\, and have some fun like that 6-year-old did back in \u201877.","true":true}
