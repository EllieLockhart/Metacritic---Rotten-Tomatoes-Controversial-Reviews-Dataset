Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"just tried to watch it for the second time... \\nThis movie destroyed everything\\, the characters\\, the canon\\, the lore and the fanbase....\\nNo more money from me for this \\\"masterpiece\\\" or its sequels.","true":true}
