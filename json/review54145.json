Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If all the racists\\,  misogynists and Jar Jar Binks fans left their prejudice outside\\, and actually watched the movie\\, I'm sure they'll agree it was great. I watched in in 3D on Monday\\, and in 5 minutes I'm off to see it in 2D. Great addition to the Star Wars series\\, and Much Much Much better than 1\\,2\\, and 3. Mind you\\, it would be difficult to be worse\\, wouldn't it?","true":true}
