Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was disappointing when compared to its predecessor. It just seemed like liberal propaganda. All males are incompetent and need strong women to lead. The villains were white men while all the heroes were minorities and had female leaders. Luke's arc seemed to end on a whimper. The new Jedi is a young female who knows everything she needs to know and needs not the wisdom of her predecessors. A nod to the \\\"know it all\\\" millennial generation. The whole thing is just disappointing and if this is a foreshadow of where Disney is taking the series I won't be at all interested in where it's going.","true":true}
