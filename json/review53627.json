Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Firstly thank you for trying your best to break the mould of the previous movies in the franchise\\, some will be happy some will not its a tough gig. I have one major gripe that left a sour taste no matter how sweet the movie.\\nWe have been starved from seeing a particular actor on screen\\, an actor that has excelled for a ridiculously long amount of years in this franchise and has been given a go once again\\, only to see the actor written off from the living with clearly so much still to offer... Disney knocked it off the bench and broke this character instead of knocking it out of the ball park in my opinion.\\nThis equals absolute failure to balance respect for a very much revered actor within the franchise with regards to script and on screen time and allowing the balance too much in favour of the direction Disney wishes to take the movie franchise and develop new characters for new fans. (Both must be done at the same time treading carefully\\, not stopping out the old from the living one movie at a time!)\\nDisney must believe a franchise that has original roots of a cult like following can acceptably rip out its core and have original fans happy whilst branching Star Wars in a new direction with new movie stars for the future. Wrong. Don't forget main actors are part of the franchises roots! Understandably it would have been a \\\"terrifying\\\" decision for a director to 'cut down' an EPIC star to the franchise\\, however if epic stars receive a reasonable amount of screen time (anakin \/ vader\\, palpatine \/ sidious) and a well deserved script\\, it makes for a much smoother and often exciting transition when its their time to go. Disney only got a taste of fan backlash with Han\\, I think the volume will turn up on this one and catch the director and Disney out for jumping the gun early\\, the franchise is a money train\\, but this actor was a good two movies of super powered fuel for the engine! (ALIVE NOT DEAD!)\\nIn summary: Disney has not 'honoured the saga's rich legacy' properly\\, Disney has rushed it when they could of maintained a new direction and the rich legacy hand in hand for a more stable amount of time. Thanks for adding insult to injury to your customer base.","true":true}
