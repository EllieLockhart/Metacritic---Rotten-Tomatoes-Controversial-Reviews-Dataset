Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I enjoy the first two thirds of the game. Although a lot of people are upset by Joel\u2019s death\\, it does make for a good story arch for Ellie. The combat and ambience was pretty good during the journey in Seattle. It goes down hill once Abby confronts Ellie in the theatre\\, and we\u2019re jolted into some eight hours of Abby\u2019s backstory. It is necessary to understand that her father was a firefly\\, but it that portion of the game should\u2019ve ended there. Abby\u2019s story would make for a good DLC\\, similar to Ellie\u2019s Left Behind DLC\\, but it wasn\u2019t enjoyable because of it\u2019s placement in the main story. I also feel there was nothing that stood out about Santa Barbra. Their big showdown could\u2019ve\\, and probably should\u2019ve happened in Seattle. Besides changing the scene a little and briefly introducing a new faction\\, the Santa Barbra sequence just a shorter repeat of Seattle. I found the ending especially horrendous. It addresses nothing in regards to Ellie\u2019s broken relationship with Dina and JJ\\, how Tommy might react to Ellie\u2019s sign of mercy\\, or just generally how Jackson was changed by everything. It seems the theme was generally that you should always be aware of how your decisions affect those around you\\, but that idea is tossed out the door in the final scene. It seems the game was meant to end in Seattle\\, but the devs felt the game was short\\, so they threw extra needless fluff in to pad runtime. A decision that drastically lowered the art and potential the game had. I really wanted to like this game\\, I even have the Firefly insignia tattooed to my forearm\\, but everything after the initial confrontation between Ellie and Abby\\, the game went downhill.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
