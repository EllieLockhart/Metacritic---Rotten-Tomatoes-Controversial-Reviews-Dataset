Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not just the one of the worst (if not the worse) Star Wars movies ever made but a fantastically bad movie in general.  \\n\\nIncoherent character development\\, a bunch of unnecessary fluff\\, and dialogue that was painful to listen to (the scene between Kylo & Rey talking about her parents sounded like it was written by the guy who does Bad Lip Reading...except it wasn't as funny as his)\\n\\nI'm generally not a conspiracy theorist but I the overall high 'critic' reviews of this film makes me suspicious of the entire industry.\\n\\nThere is simply no way anyone who has any sense of filmmaking and storytelling would rate this as higher than a 3-4\/10 unless they were paid off.\\n\\nUnbelievable.","true":true}
