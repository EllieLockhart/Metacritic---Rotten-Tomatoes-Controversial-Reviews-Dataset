Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson may as well have spat in the face of Star Wars fans. Full of absolute character assassination and worthless side plots that do nothing to enhance the narrative\\, this film shows a clear lack of respect for fans with the central message of \\\"kill the past\\\" seeming to forget the entire defining concepts of Star Wars.","true":true}
