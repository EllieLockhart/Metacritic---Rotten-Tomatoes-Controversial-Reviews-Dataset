Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible story line with unsatisfying character development. the \\\"space chase\\\" was laughable. Space cruisers that have to be gassed up like Ford Vans? The action \/ battle scenes were hokey and predictable. No light sabre fight...boo! I would rank this the worst Star Wars movie. Been a fan since I saw the original in theatres as a kid. Take everything you know and like about Star Wars and throw it out the window with this flick...that's not a good thing","true":true}
