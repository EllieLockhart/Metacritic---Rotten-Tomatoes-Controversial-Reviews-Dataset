Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I'm not a \\\"bot\\\" nor part of the supposed \\\"review bombing\\\" here\\, which didn't happen\\, the film mostly sucks and people can see that and through the lies of the critics. I've seen every Star Wars film in the theaters since 1977\\, and this was the most underwhelming and disappointing one to date.  Even The Phantom Menace is better in some ways -had an epic lightsaber duel which TLJ skipped altogether.  \\nIt gets two stars from me for its great John Williams soundtrack and for some of the beautiful and spectacular visuals\\, but the story blows.  \\n\\nThe mistreatment and misuderstanding of Luke Skywalker's fundemental character is the worst part\\, and I must agree with actor Mark Hamill who disliked that too. \\n\\nThey also missed the opportunity here to write the deceased Carrie Fisher out of the saga\\, but instead she survives an explosion and the vaccumm of space ina laughably absurd manner by flying Mary Poppins-like to safety. They killed off the wrong Skywalker in this film! \\n\\nThe Finn\/Rose story arc is worthless\\,tedious\\, and painfully bad.  If I ever see this film again\\, much will have to muted or fast-forwarded to make it bearable -especially this part. TLJ is definitely in the bottom tier of the franchise alongside the first two prequels.","true":true}
