Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has some great and memorable scenes. Unfortunately the plot doesn't make any sense in the context of the Star Wars universe. It's like the movie was made for people who've only seen The Force Awakens. It creates major plot holes in the Star Wars universe. If you're a fan\\, get drunk before you see it.","true":true}
