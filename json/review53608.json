Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film has a strong first and third act\\, with good cast of actors and very distinct artistic style to itself.\\n\\nHowever 2nd act of the film overstays it's welcome - mostly due to poor pacing. Too many characters in too many locations watering down the plot which begun with a strong leading narrative.\\n\\nFilm is ignorant or actively dismantles preestablished Star Wars lore and themes\\, boldly taking the series into the direction we'd expect from more postmodernistic productions.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi isn't a bad film\\, and it is enjoyable to watch as a stand alone adventure\\, but it's contribution to the larger Star Wars universe is questionable at best - while Force Awakens left us guessing\\, The Last Jedi leaves us uninspired.","true":true}
