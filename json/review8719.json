Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fool me once\\, shame on you.\\n\\nI saw the movie when it came and I'm still feeling disturbance in force. As long diehard Star Wars fan (I was born long before the New hope) my soul is torn apart in feelings about the new film.\\n\\nI actually liked the ep 7 and though that this one is going to maintain the well set plotlines. No change. Instead\\, this one feels more like standalone Star Wars film\\, that has actually very little to do with SW lore or traditions; or even good story telling.\\n\\nThe start scroll gave me good vibes\\, as always and I was ready to see great start. Then I see one X-wing pilot that gives my-phone-is-breaking-up humor. Instead of shooting him\\, the Imperials (The first order) let the pilot came closer and charge up afterburner. Why!?! I'm not asking why the Imperials are doing it\\, as they are just actors with prewritten scripts. I'm asking why to ruin creditability of the whole bunch. Are the Imperials led by a laser brain? I want to fear them\\, not to have a laugh. Wader would have beheaded the whole bunch. I miss him.\\n\\nAfter one-man-beats-all show (why not anyone shut him down\\, just for change)\\, there are these suicide bombers. This is not the World War II film. I can't figure out any harder way to deliver the bombs. Have anyone heard of missiles? They are having a lot of robots\\, but why humans are sacrificing themselves for nothing?\\n\\nAs film finally goes to see Luke\\, I stunned by his response to the offered lightsaber. He throws it away. No creditability there either. Luckily the Yoda comes to give him some speech (the best part of the film) and Luke saves the day by ultimate sacrifice at the end.\\n\\nThe biggest plot hole of the movie\\, that I can find\\, is the chase. I wish Wader would have beheaded general Hux and ordered the fleet to jump close to the rebels. Problem solved. No\\, Hux wants to have a joyride. He thinks that rebels are not smart enough to think any escape plan. And if they happen to have one\\, someone is going to tell it to him (someone\\, please shoot the Poe down).\\n\\nTo save the day (for Imperials) this Poe\\, sends two sidekicks to a casino planet looking for a hacker. What a waste of film (or memory\\, as the camera is digital\\, I think). Why to write such a journey that achieve nothing positive? Finally Poe kills most of the rebels by revealing the plans to the unreliable hacker. Well done.\\n\\nMeanwhile Kylo Ren kills SL Snoke and reveals that Reys parents sold her for some money. What a waste of good plot lines!\\n\\nAs movie goes on\\, we get to the battle of Hoth duplication. Salt\\, really? In my mind I can see salt fairies that spread salt (or how else there would be thin layer of salt everywhere). I can understand snow\\, but no even layer of salt everywhere on red sand. As battle comes\\, no changes\\, no none shots Poe down (and no missiles or robots). But when Finn finally wants to do something right\\, Rose stops him.\\n\\nFinally all rebels left are put into the Millennium Falcon. Are all the others dead? I didn't see it.\\n\\nAnd then the end. What a crash landing. I hated the boy\\, when I first saw him. Now I hate him even more (I have nothing against the actor\\, just the role). I'm feeling that we are going to see the stable Jedi wannabe even more.","true":true}
