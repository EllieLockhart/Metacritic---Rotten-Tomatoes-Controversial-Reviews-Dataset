Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand want to get rid of the old characters to bring on the new ones. But they can't have the old characters go out as heroes??? Han Solo is gutted like a fish... Luke Skywalker is turned into a lousy character and fades away... This is  the best these writers can come up with???","true":true}
