Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To those who say this is a bad movie I just have to say\\, Amazing. Everything you just said was wrong. I have been a life long Star Wars fan and have been fortunate enough to have lived long enough to see all the movies in theaters.  No Star Wars movie has been perfect.  This one isn't either.  But it is still an amazing addition to the series.  Far better than the prequels\\, better than Rogue One\\, and better than Return of the Jedi in my opinion.  For those who complain about not getting backstories on characters\\, I suggest you rewatch the original trilogy again and see how much back story was given to characters like Chewbacca\\, the Emperor\\, Admiral Akbar\\, Boba Fett\\, Mon Mothma\\, etc.","true":true}
