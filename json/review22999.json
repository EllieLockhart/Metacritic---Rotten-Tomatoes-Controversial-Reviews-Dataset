Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of meaningless plot and dialog. Awkward attempts at humor. Ultimately wipes the table clean with no interesting plot points to really carry into and resolve in Episode 9.\\n\\nIt had all the elements to be a Star Wars movie which means I don't regret spending the money to experience it. But I was ultimately disappointed.","true":true}
