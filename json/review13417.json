Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie very much\\, all of the performances were amazing and the plot twists were awesome. However\\, the plot jumped around a bit to much for my liking.","true":true}
