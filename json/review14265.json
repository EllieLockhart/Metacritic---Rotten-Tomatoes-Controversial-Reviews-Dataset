Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the hate. After 3 screenings I can say not only I was pleased\\, but the FULL HOUSE crowd of fans filling every seat the every theater\\, even just today\\, roarded with chears\\, laughter\\, claps\\, and chatter at the end about how much they loved it. I love it. It\u2019s such a fantastic film in every way. Direction\\, cinematography\\, acting\\, story\\, fight choreography\\, music... I could go on forever. It is a fun\\, epic change to the universe yet still feels like Star Wars. Go see it.","true":true}
