Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the theme of failure that Rian Johnson captured in this film. The second time watching it (without my own expectations) really helped me see the message Rian wanted to convey to the audience. It was a fun Star Wars movie and an important one to see our heroes pass the baton of their legacy to new heroes.","true":true}
