Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 1977 George Lucas gave us Starwars\\, a film that captivated an entire generation\\, a space opera that was fun\\, entertaining and had us kids cheering on our hero's. \\nThen the saga continues in 2017\\,except that it doesn't. \\nThis film does not feel like Starwars and the characters that survived from the original trilogy don't resemble the characters that we grew up with and had come to love. \\nInconsistencies and plot holes abound\\, and one scene in particular\\, regarding everyone's favourite princess\\, will leave you gobsmacked\\, laughing or embarrassed. \\nRuin Johnson was history's most successful franchise and rather than trying to make his vision fit within a trilogy of films\\, he seems to have instead behaved like an impatient child at an amusement Park\\, running around trying to get on every ride and see everything  rather than pacing themselves. \\nWhere this rushed movie leaves the next director remains to be seen\\, as the story seems to be all but told. \\nIt'll take a miracle or perhaps some guidance from the Force to save this franchise now\\, and the fans will be left wanting A New Hope.","true":true}
