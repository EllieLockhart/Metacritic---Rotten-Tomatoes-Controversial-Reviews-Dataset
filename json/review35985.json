Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi only answers one question reasonably well\\, will people really like a movie that is mostly about a ship being chased threw space. Everything in this movie is a let down Ray yep a no body\\, Snoike who cares about his story\\, Luke while not killing his father and never losing hope decides he has to kill his nephew due to the possibility he would go dark\\, yep that makes sense. This movie pretty much killed any enthusiasm I had for the series. Unlike Luke at least there is a reason behind it.","true":true}
