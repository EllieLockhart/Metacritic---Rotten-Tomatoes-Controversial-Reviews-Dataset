Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what to say... The disappointment I felt from this movie cannot be put into words. Rian Johnson simply extended his middle fingers to us fans\\, the history of Star Wars\\, and to JJ Abrams' The Force Awakens. There is no build off of what was started in episode 7\\, the skywalker map? Luke's light sabre? Snoke? We get nothing\\, except the answer to Rey's parentage\\, sort of? Its pretty ambiguous\\, and we still dont have a last name for her. \\nAll we really got\\, was 2 and a half hours of a stubborn\\, angry\\, Luke who does nothing meaningful until the very last act\\, then dies; as well as a pointless sidequest with pointless new characters that feels like forced filler. We got over the top humerous antics\\, over the top force strength\\, and superman Leia. \\nAlso\\, am I the only one that found the whole\\, First Order fleet chasing one lone cruiser thing\\, absolutely ridiculous!? Seriously\\, one lone ship totally destroys the entirety of the Resisitence base\\, from outer space\\, in the opening scene. Yet the whole fleet\\, including Snoke's monstrous flag ship\\, can't take down one lone cruiser? And instead follows if for an eternity until it runs out of fuel? That my friends by itself is enough to make this whole movie a total farce! \\nChewbacca\\, 3po\\, and r2 are basically ignored (the r2 luke reunion is good)\\, Carrie Fisher gets no closure\\, all the new characters get no development\\, Finn and Poe become much less likeable. It goes on and on\\, I didn't know it was possible to mess up the story line this bad\\, but congrats Rian and Disney\\, you did. This doesn't even feel luke it's attached to episode 7.\\nOne word to describe this movie? Sacrilige... Here's to JJ Abrams and episode 9\\, we need many answers\\, please salvage this abominable train wreck.","true":true}
