Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the longest instalment in the Star Wars franchise\\, and packs in more twists and subplots than any that have come before. Admittedly some work better than others\\, but amongst the filler there are some great character moments\\, epic battles and revelations that I'd never have expected. It's not as tightly scripted as the likes of Empire Strikes Back\\, but as a modern-day Star Wars movie it's certainly one of the better ones. Bring on Episode IX.","true":true}
