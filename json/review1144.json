Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who hasn't silently written their own script for Star Wars in their heads\\, or find the looney conspiracy theories about liberal propaganda to be as laughable as they are will enjoy this movie for what it is: the best action adventure flick of the year and the fourth best Star Wars movie.","true":true}
