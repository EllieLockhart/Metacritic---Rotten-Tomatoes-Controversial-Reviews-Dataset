Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film I have been waiting for.  This IS the heart and souls of what \\\"Star Wars\\\" set out to establish forty years ago.  The characters are deep and complex\\, the dialogue is wonderful\\, and the fact that I have strong women to identify with (a beautifully strong Asian woman playing a fantastic character?! YES BESH!!) is remarkable.  What we are seeing here is a rebirth and I cannot recommend it enough.  Rian Johnson\\, thank you!","true":true}
