Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is killing Star Wars. I was so excited for this movie to come out. Don't waste your time if you are a fan of the series. The forth awakens was not the best but it was pretty good. Rouge one was awesome! this movie was literally pointless. It answered nothing that we were wondering about the characters especially Snoke. I just am so disappointed with this movie. Disney better wake up and realize that they have to course correct fast or the fan base that makes star wars what it is will slowly drift away.","true":true}
