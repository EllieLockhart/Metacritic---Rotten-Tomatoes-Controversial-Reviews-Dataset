Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Big letdown. Every good possible further development of the story of episode 7 was stifled in the bud. And the potential of one of the greatest characters was simply given away. All in all\\, the story seems too long without real tensions.","true":true}
