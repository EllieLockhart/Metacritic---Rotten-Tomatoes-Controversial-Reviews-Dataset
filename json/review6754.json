Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the fanboys who can't believe someone would dare to do something different with their precious mythology.  TLJ is probably the best of the new trilogy\\, although I'll have to watch TRoS again after it has sunk in.  The disillusionment of Luke makes so much sense and is handled well.  His Epic ending worthy of his legacy.  And the much-maligned Leia moment is a cool reminder that she is\\, after all\\, a Skywalker.  Beyond that\\, I loved the development of the relationship between Rey and Kylo which serves as a foundation for what ultimately comes in TRoS.  Great stuff.  Since The Force Awakens had to be almost a reboot as much as a new movie\\, the trilogy really needed a movie to establish itself as a work unto itself\\, and TLJ delivers","true":true}
