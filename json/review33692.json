Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie\\, filled with so many plot holes\\, it's sad that critics have so little balls these days to not even rate a movie properly\\, instead choosing to suck feminist SJW's off by giving it a good rating. Face it\\, not a single person who has watched this movie thought that it made sense to hide the plan from poe\\, and that is just one of the many plot holes. I beg if you do want to try watching this movie\\, you pirate it so that no one who worked on this movie gets your money.","true":true}
