Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not like Star Wars at all... This movie had way too many plotlines that added nothing to push the story forward\\, pacing felt all wrong\\, settings didn't have the typical SW-feel to them\\, not to mention that characters felt awful. Rian truly butchered them. Maybe some good explosion moments but that's all\\, even humour felt cheap.","true":true}
