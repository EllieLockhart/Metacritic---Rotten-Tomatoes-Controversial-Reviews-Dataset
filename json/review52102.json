Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the movie\\, I had a really mixed and confused feeling. A visually stunning ride for sure\\, but something really didn't feel right. The way Luke was handled\\, felt totally out of character.\\n\\nAfter giving it some weeks thoughts I have concluded that I think it's a really bad movie all in all. For reasons stated here by others. I will just mention that I really\\, really hate the way they went with Luke\\, pissing on his character and legacy. The writers must really have hated him\\, why would they otherwise throw in such a disturbing scene as the one where he's milking blue milk from alien tits and then drink it with mad\\, lunatic eyes. WTF WAS THAT??!\\n\\nAlso\\, big minus for not giving a fuck about previous\\, established lore\\, and throwing away everything set up in TFA.\\n\\nPoint given for the visuals\\, music and good to great performances by the actors. But a terrible\\, terrible script.\\n\\nI find it hard to believe that I will see ep 9 in cinemas after this \\, probably wait until DVD. Disney has killed Star Wars\\, which makes me really sad.","true":true}
