Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Given the thousands of directions they could have taken this franchise\\, I never thought they would take it to a place worse than Attack of the Clones. \\nNo identifiable plot\\nNo identifiable direction\\nNo explanation of backstory of protagonist or antagonist\\nPoorly executed attempts of cheesy humor\\nToo much similarity to Empire\\, with the bad writing and poor direction of a bad direct to DVD sci-fi movie. \\nFire everyone\\nStart over\\nHire Lucas to take the next one back to a high level. \\nDon't ruin things for lifelong Star Wars  fans to make Mickey Mouse stockholders dividends. \\n0.5 stars because of the year I waited to see the next chapter. \\nIf I could rate 0\\, I would.","true":true}
