Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand the hate this movie is getting. This is film making at its finest. I've loved Star Wars since I was old enough to watch movies. Empire has been my favorite movie of all time. I've never been in awe of any scene from any star wars movies. This movie has multiple scenes that absolutely took my breath away. \\n\\nDon't believe the haters. They're basement dwelling neckbeards who are salty because their EU god Kevin J Anderson's Luke Skywalker never existed. And their precious Mara Jade\\, Jaina\\, and Jacen are gone. This is Star Wars. And this is story telling at its finest. \\n\\nAnd this movie doesn't care what your nostalgia says. Rian Johnson did an amazing job making me feel.\\n\\nThank you for that.","true":true}
