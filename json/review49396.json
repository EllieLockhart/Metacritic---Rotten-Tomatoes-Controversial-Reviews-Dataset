Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars yet. You should be embarrassed it got a 93% some1 is payed off or afraid. Movie was Just awful. Half the story lines were fails and pointless to the story. The ship in space almost out of fuel for an hour on screen was so boring I couldn't take another second. They killed Luke in the worst way he deserved better. And the projection could have been used like 1000 times what a terrible idea I could have written w better script. Smoke was the worst character in the history of the franchise. The porgs were just a marketing sceme\/mo eye grab to sell toys. the whole story was a joke could have been told in an hour. Meaningless plot points terrible reveals and twists. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and almost want my money back\\,","true":true}
