Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What they did with Luke was a crime. I do understand the need to pass the baton to a new generation but it could have done in a much better way. At the end they could have sent Luke out into the galaxy to look for the next generation or something. I have waited over 30 years to see Luke in action again. This was such a disappointment. Disney has ruined the Star Wars of my youth. I will not go to the theater to see another Star Wars movie. If I do see any more it will be on cable.","true":true}
