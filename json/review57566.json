Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the longest SW movie ever and BOY did it feel like it. I never got sucked into it. Rather I spent two hours and a half completely confused about what the movie was trying to do\\, trying to make me feel. The answer seems to be nothing at all. The humor was way too heavy\\, killing every little bit of drama we could have had. The plot and characters' decisions were beyond stupid\\, and when you think about it\\, despite how long and full it is\\, nothing happens in this film. Absolutely nothing. A day has passed and we're left exactly where we were at the ends of TFA\\, except with more dead that we don't really care about because the people on screen don't either. They butchered everything that was set up in TFA and whether you liked it or not\\, it was a movie that happened they can't just reckt all the characters and be done with it. Sadly that's true for this one too and I have absolutely no idea what they plan to do for the next one. It really feels like they didn't write a story for this trilogy. Directors just comes in and play in the sandbox\\, do whatever they want and let others deal with their mess. A shame and a tremendous disappointment.","true":true}
