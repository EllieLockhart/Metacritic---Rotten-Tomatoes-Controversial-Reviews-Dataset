Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even better then VII.  so many overly passionate\\, loser fucking basement trolls who hated the movie before they even watched it.  Everyone who loved it walked out\\, and that was that.  But every fucking loser with an idea of \\\"what should have happened\\\" in their favorite franchise of children's movies ran to the internet with their voices to hate on a pretty fucking well made film.  Trying to take something out of canon because you thought the story should have went a different way is idiotic.  People hating on the movie for having female leads sound like misogynistic children.\\,\\,","true":true}
