Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insult to fans and characters alike\\, TLJ is the worst entry in this franchise to date and marks the end of many fans' journey with Star Wars\\, including myself.  No plot\\, no character development\\, no payoffs\\, no storyline.  What we got as SJW agenda-pushing identity politics\\, hyper-feminism (and deprecation of pretty much every male character)\\, a story that made no sense at all\\, large chunks of time spent on completely irrelevant side-plots (ALL of Canto Bight)\\, and an incredibly lame\\, unimpressive send off of a beloved character that was killed off for no good reason.  (Albeit that character\\, Luke\\, was inexplicably changed from the one we knew in the original trilogy\\, and even Mark Hamill himself said that this was a complete deviation of the character\\, for the worse).  This was a huge disappointment and an absolute pile of garbage.  Hopefully the departure of fans from this franchise will cause Lucasfilm\\, Disney\\, and Kathleen Kennedy to WAKE UP and stop producing trash.","true":true}
