Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's impossible to explain all the problems with this movie. It ruins the characters\\, destroys canon\\, and effectively negates what was foreshadowed in Force Awakens\\, an even worse movie. The most glaring problem was the trip to Cantonica\\, which besides being completely unrealistic as a way to save the fleet\\, was that it was only necessary because Purple-hair didn't tell Poe her plan for apparently no reason. Other big problems include Snoke's non-history\\, Luke's idea to kill his nephew\\, slow gravity-using WW2-style bombers\\, major plot rips from similar movies (such as Galactica's FTL into a base star)\\, and the simple observation that this is not episode 8 -- it's continuing in the tradition of Force Awakens to remake the original trilogy. Almost every scene is ripped from the originals -- for example\\, the island is just Dagobah all over again. And with the extremely misplaced sense of humor\\, you get the feeling you're watching only a parody of the real Star Wars.","true":true}
