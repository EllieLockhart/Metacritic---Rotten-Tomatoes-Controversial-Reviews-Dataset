Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't Star Wars. I don't know what it is\\, but this isn't Star Wars at all. And I'm a huge long life time fan of the original series. \\nRey is a Mary Sue (everything comes to her so easily with no struggle that she can beat Ren\\, who is supposedly just as powerful - Luke said so - and has been training all his life? Yeah\\, right.) \\nThe relegate the characters they introduced in TFA (which I also did not care for) to smaller parts in favor of other new characters you don't care about. Those new characters didn't do anything any of the already existing characters could and should have done.  And what the heck was that part with the racing long-eared things? Silly and pointless. Which was most of this movie.","true":true}
