Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created account to review this.  Movie slaps the face of Star Wars franchise and disregards what the previous 7\/8 movies created. Starts with opening scene when Luke apathetically tosses his lightsaber over a cliff.  Luke is not sarcastic and bitter\\, Han was.  Flying Leia.  Too much humor.  Anyone can use the force--it doesn't matter if you have any midi-chlorians or not.  Yoda's ghost burns up sacred tree where Jedi texts are kept.  It is one poke after another at our sacred religion.  Almost seems intentional.  Not to mention the endless chase scene where the cruiser's force-field is strong enough to withstand all attacks and it's just fast enough to evade the entire New Order fleet (only the Millenium Falcon can do that).  Major disappointment.  Not sure what the critics watched.","true":true}
