{"101487":199369,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, there's a lot of hate in some of these reviews. Yes\\, I totally get it\\, this movie was a mixed bag for sure.  But I liked it more than the Force Awakens believe it or not.  That movie felt like a simple remake to me with almost no surprises.  Anyway\\, here's a list of things I liked\\, and things I didn't like or had questions about. Lots of SPOILERS here\\, you've been warned. \\nThis is more a review for people who've already seen it. Here we go...\\n\\nLiked:\\n \\nI liked that Ben Solo killed Snoke and then told Rey to let the old die (Snoke\/Luke) and that they could lead together.  This was a darkly romantic move\\, and probably the best twist in the movie. For a moment it seemed like he was killing Snoke because he was tempted by the light side of the force. Nope\\, he wanted all the power to himself\\, AND have a partner in crime. I'm pretty sure he's the first dark side of the force villain who seems interested in women.\\n\\nI liked Snoke as a villain. I only wish we knew more about him or where he came from.\\n\\nMark Hamill did his best acting ever in this one. Carry Fisher was great too\\, WAY better than she was in Force Awakens.    \\n\\nThose snow foxes at the end were cool looking.\\n\\nThere were a lot of bad ass female characters. This is a good thing. \\n\\nDidn't like\/ have questions:\\n\\nThe telephone joke at the beginning went on way too long.  It made the empire leader look like a buffoon. These empire leaders are supposed to be evil and cold\\, like Nazis.  It makes every subsequent scene he's in feel way less dangerous. He's basically a human punching bag in this movie and by the end it gets really old.   \\n\\nWhy didn't Poe tell Holdo his plan right away?  Or at least as soon as Finn and the girl left to the gambling planet?  It was actually a good plan and the only hope they really had\\, as far as he knew.\\n\\nSpeaking of Holdo...she stayed behind to pilot the ship?  Then why the hell was she lingering on the dock after her casual and non-rushed goodbye to Leia?  The ship was flying fine without her wasn't it? Remember she still didn't have her 'light speed into the enemy' plan at that point.  And oh yeah\\, the empire didn't realize they were all abandoning ship and heading for that fortified base on that planet UNTIL Benecio del Toro TOLD THEM???  Are you kidding me?!  (What was up with that stuttering anyway?) And wait\\, the main ship was almost out of fuel right?  So how the hell was Holdo able to warp into light speed? Oh lordy.\\n\\nWhat was up with the mistreated kids\/animals on the gambling planet?  Were we supposed to feel a bunch of empathy for them? I honestly felt nothing.  Literally ZERO feelings. If anything I resented them as some kind of sympathy device the writers came up with.  Still not sure why they were even in the movie.  Maybe so one of them could be in the final 'shooting star' scene?  (Which by the way was a terrible way to end it.  Maybe if Leia was looking at the shooting star it would have worked better)\\n\\nLet me get this straight\\, Ben Solo kicks Luke's ass years earlier.   Then Rey kicks Luke's ass also?  Is Luke just weak or something? Rey knocked him to ground.  That would be like Luke knocking Yoda or Obi Wan Kenobi over. They totally ruined the force hierarchy.  Later\\, Ben and Rey are basically an even draw in their fight? Rey's development of her force powers just seems really uneven and murky. (Rey kicked Ben's ass in Force Awakens as i recall\\, why are they a draw now? I don't remember that movie too well to be honest..) Also\\, at the end\\, Luke doesn't even show up in person.  Just a freaking force induced hologram?  Yeah\\, I guess that shows some mastery of the force but wtf\\, did he just go there to apologize to Ben and to buy the others time to find their way to the exit at the back of the cave where the empire should be able to find them in like 5 minutes? Sigh. It would have been nice to see you there in person Luke\\, just saying. \\n\\nAnd about Luke\\, he was basically a weak mess in this movie.  Totally waffling about killing Ben\\, (He was right\\, Ben was dangerous\\, kill the mf already\\, but not in his sleep\\, come on Luke!) Waffling about destroying the sacred texts.  Waffling about training Rey\\, then giving her really weak Jedi training\\, something like:  'We don't control the force\\, it's in everything and everyone\\, none of us special' That scene drained the whole movie of power.  We WANT certain characters to use the force and be bad asses with it. \\\"The force is strong with this one\\\".  Remember that old expression?  \\n\\nEarlier I mentioned the strong female characters were a good thing. They are\\, but I think the filmmakers MAY have swung too far in that direction which has led to many crappy audiences reviews\\, mostly by men I'm guessing. The filmmakers basically made every female character good\/strong\/smart\/heroic etc and made every male character either weak\\, evil\\, conniving\\, or impulsive.  Finn is the one exception\\, but he came across as kind of sneaky and selfish by wanting to jump ship at the beginning. Then his plan gets thwarted by the girl. Later when trying to sacrifice himself for the greater cause\\, he gets thwarted by that girl AGAIN. (For romantic reasons no less. Was there ANY chemistry between them?  I sure didn't notice it. They should have let him have his swan song!) Also\\, Poe had a good plan\\, but it fails\\, and he ultimately is left looking stupid by Leia & Holdo.  So I'm thinking at least some of the male audience left feeling frustrated or neutered by this movie\\, but not really knowing why. \\n\\nOverall I give it 3 out of 5 stars for good production values and some entertaining scenes and performances.  I'll most likely go to see the final movie in this trilogy when it comes out.","true":true}
