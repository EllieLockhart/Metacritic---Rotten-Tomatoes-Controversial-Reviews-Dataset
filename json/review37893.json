Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script is awful\\, I can't complain about the acting because the script is so cringey that of course even the Brad Pitt would seem like a bad actor in this movie. This is basically just a money making stunt which has no interesting plot\\, no character development\\, and really ruins the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
