Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so corporate\\, so franchise\\, so predictable in it's attempt to be non-predictable. All the building blocks we know and love from the previous movies are used in ways that shall bring Disney the greatest amount of spin-off-ablilty and wide-audience-likeability. Worst Star Wars so far! My hope for future films just died\\, sadly!","true":true}
