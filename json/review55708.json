Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies\\, very thought provoking. Beautiful cinematography\\, excellent special effects\\, Luke\\, Rey\\, Ben\\, Finn\\, Poe and Rose all get interesting character arcs. My genuine reaction after first viewing was very much the same as how the characters on TBBT were exhausted in a positive way after seeing TFA for the first time in \\\"The Opening Night Excitation\\\".  Any of the apparent plot holes or character inconsistencies are easily dismissed with either a bit of thought or a proper understanding of the prequels (most of the people complaining are those whose view of star wars only contains the original trilogy\\, whereas the themes and concepts presented in the prequels\\, when properly understood explain these supposed discrepancies).\\n\\nOverall it continues themes presented in the prequels\\, as well as the original trilogy\\, and so it feels like it ties together the whole saga thus far. I am excited to see how the finale will wrap all this up and lead the themes to their proper conclusions. Definitely worth a watch.","true":true}
