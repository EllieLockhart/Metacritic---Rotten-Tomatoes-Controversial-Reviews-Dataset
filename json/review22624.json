Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Light saber fighting scenes are poor. Too much try-hard jokes throughout the whole film. Plot holes are everywhere. No idea how critics claimed this is the best Star Wars movie. I personally prefer The Force Awakens.","true":true}
