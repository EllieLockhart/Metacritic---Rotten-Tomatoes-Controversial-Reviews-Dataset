Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a visually stunning movie which subverted all expectations. Instead of trying to play by the rules of the old trilogy\\, it develops it's own unique themes. The concept that greatness can come from nobodies is new to star wars. The relationship between Rey and Kylo is by far the best I have seen in the whole series. It isn't simple\\, and it isn't really romantic\\, but it is just about two people who could work together to give each other a greater understanding of life. I love how they killed off Snoke\\, cause I didn't care about him\\, and I love how they gave Luke a different and more compelling character arc. \\n\\nI don't like the casino subplot. It was stupid and unnecessary\\, but considering it was the only part I didn't like\\, I'll let it slide.","true":true}
