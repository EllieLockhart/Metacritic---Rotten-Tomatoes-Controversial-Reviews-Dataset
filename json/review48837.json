Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst one yet\\, so very disappointing\\, had high hopes for this one after being very happy with Rouge One. But The Force Awakens was a disappointment\\, and The Last Jedi did nothing to redeem it. Massive and very obvious plot holes combined with a poor story.","true":true}
