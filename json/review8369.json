Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like i was watching your typical Marvel movie. In your face humor. Hundreds of rebels are killed off and Rian Johnson thought it'll be great to throw in a joke (Read the interview\\, that really was his idea.) Reys character is great but not enough to save the film. Skywalker named has been ruined. Is Ren trying to become the next Vader or is he in need of therapy? So many things wrong with this script. Waste of time.","true":true}
