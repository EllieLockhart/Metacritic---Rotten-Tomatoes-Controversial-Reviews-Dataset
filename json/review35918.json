Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie to date....Terrible story line.  Luke kills a child? Leia flies through space? Luke is a washed up wuss? Who is Rey meant nothing? Who is Snoke meant nothing? I could have written and directed a better film than this.  This movie ruined the whole franchise...The Last Jedi is far worse than any prequel.","true":true}
