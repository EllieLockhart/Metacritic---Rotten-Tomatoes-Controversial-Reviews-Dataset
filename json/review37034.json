Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie worth 1.5hours\\, not 2.5hours. Finn and Rose is not needed in the movie\\, at all. The story is boring \\, not a typical star wars movie. The last 20 mins is totally ok if it is not there. If we name it to Star Ship Troopers: The Last Trooper then i am not so disappointed with this Grade B movie.","true":true}
