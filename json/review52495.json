Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrendous film and the worst chapter of the Star Wars legacy by far.  It is a disjointed movie riddled with gaping plot holes\\, terrible dialog\\, humor that misses\\, annoyingly preachy social commentary\\, and imbecilic characters that have little depth and clearly no reasoning skills.  They made so many ridiculously stupid decisions that I wanted several of the lead characters to die in the film.  Not only does this latest installment spit on the Star Wars legacy & lore as well as in the face of fans\\, but it also paints a bleak picture for the future of the franchise.  Thanks for ruining Star Wars.","true":true}
