Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simplistic plot with great action scenes\\, explored characters yet development for old and new characters\\, complete shock\\, strong female and diverse cast\\, and that same Star Wars feel from the originals! This franchise is in good hands!","true":true}
