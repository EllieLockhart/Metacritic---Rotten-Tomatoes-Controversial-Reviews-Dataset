Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a fan of the first game\\, I must say im disappointed in the game and I expected a lot better from a game that took years and years to make.

The main downfall of the game is the story\\, compared to the first game this story is a joke. There is still some good moments that I enjoyed. The first half of the game is okay\\, but the second half is stupid\\, I won't spoil but they force us to play like 10 hours as a character that no one gives a **** about and I would say that's the worse part of the story. Now if you completly ignore the storyline and just focus on the gameplay\\, the game is really good on that point\\, its like the first game but 5 times better and the amazing amount of little details shows how much love has been put on this game. I just wish the storyline would not be garbage. Hey but who knows? Maybe Naughty Dog can still redeem themselves with a dlc? Or even a better version of factions multiplayer from the first game...\r\rOh yeah I almost forgot to mention how naughty dog lied to us in the trailers\\, if you expect the game to be like we see it in the trailers then you will be disappointed... Just know that Joel is not gonna have as a important role in the game as they made us think in the trailers.\r\rI don't think I would recommand it but at least the game is not completely bad.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
