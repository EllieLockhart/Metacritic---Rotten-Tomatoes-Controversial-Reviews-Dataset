Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this movie I was always a fan and I completely understand why people would hate this movie but it do things so differently compared the other films in the franchise it gave Luke some character I wish they did bring up plot points from episode 7 but whatever. This movie just hit the right notes for me\\, but like I said can fully understand why others would hate it","true":true}
