Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Character development story arch and progression of the plot\\, luke couldve been handled slightly different but i understand why he was the way he was\\, lightsaber battle was also very well done and the visuals of the movie were great","true":true}
