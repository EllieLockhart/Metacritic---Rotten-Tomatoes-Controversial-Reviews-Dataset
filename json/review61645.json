There is no other way to put it and I find it unbelievable that people actually like it... It has nothing to do about SJW or LGBT+ but Druckmann and his ethics clearly steered this game in a direction that ruined it.

THIS IS JUST BAD! If you can't creatively come up with a solution or explanation for your plot but must rely on shock value and there attachment to the character and have them killed off 2 hours into the game!\rThis game had so much potential and they killed it. I just feel bad for the developers\\, the amount of work they've put in just for one guy to screw it all up must be devastating. It's a gorgeous game but it's a story game and if the story fails the graphics can't make up for it.\rThere is only 2 good scenes\\, Ellie in the guitar shop and the flashback to Ellie birthday. That is why I've given it a 2\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
