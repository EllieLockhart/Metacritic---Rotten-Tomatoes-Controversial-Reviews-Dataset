Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am 45 years old\\, since I was a child I have been a fan of star wars\\, always before a new movie\\, I saw all the previous ones\\, this will never happen again. To give a life hoping to see the Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker\\, and what I saw was a scared man who hid for having made a mistake\\, defeated by his student\\, flees and the galaxy is screwed. It does not give answers of anything or anyone. Rey from scavenger to Jedi master in two days\\, is a bullshit.","true":true}
