Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pointless plot line and roles. Ray is getting stronger with no training at all unlike Luke and anikian. Snoke is a huge mystery that was never explained. Find character is really pointless and I'm sure in that time era this giant frigates wouldn't need fuel they would run off of a reactor or somthing. Just that that was pointless. I will give them credit for the bombing scene and showing how the empire and rebels get there equipment. This series needs a better plot and more character development.","true":true}
