Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me preface this by saying that I thought Ep.7 did a serviceable job of creating something from nothing. It introduced some interesting characters and concepts that fit in with the established universe and the idea of a storm trooper (Finn) defecting from the First Order who joins the resistance due to moral objections would have been adequate material for a true main character. It provides motivation and room for the character to grow. Rey\\, while not as interesting was a great vehicle for Fin's story\\, helping him escape the clutches of the First Order and leading him to his next threshold while also becoming a powerful ally. \\n\\nMy biggest gripe\\, aside from there being yet ANOTHER spherical super weapon they have to destroy is that it took all the effort the Rebels put in the original Star Wars trilogy and completely nullified it by introducing yet ANOTHER \\\"Empire\\\" like entity that came from nowhere just so we have something for our heroes to defeat. We've got another mysterious Sith Lord with an incomprehensibly large army who wants power for SOME reason we're never told and a Resistance made up of people who are fighting it\\, again\\, for reasons we're never shown or told. The audience is expected to believe that in 30 years since the complete destruction of the Empire a Government\/Military of Galactic proportions was established and converted an entire planet into a weapon. Essentially\\, everything Luke\\, Han\\, Leia and the others fought and sacrificed for was for nothing and here we are again in the same place we were at the beginning of A New Hope. \\n\\nHowever\\, Ep.7 does pose some interesting questions and I was eager to see where they go with this plucky new group of adventurers. Rey is Force Sensitive\\, where did she really come from? Does Finn survive? How will the Resistance defeat Snoke? Ok\\, sure - it's the first new film since the Prequels and anything new is good. Hopefully in the next one some of these very important questions will be answered.\\n\\nThis is what makes Ep.8 so unbearably painful to watch. Rian Johnson is given a foundation to work off of with many questions to be answered and a plot to be potentially driven in a new and exciting direction\\, so\\, what happens? Let me sum it up for you. The First Order\\, at a snail's pace\\, pursues the last remaining Resistance ships for 155 minutes\\, until eventually all the main characters escape. The End.\\n\\nWhat about all those burning questions we had from Ep.7? Well\\, Snoke\\, the \\\"Supreme Leader\\\" is unceremoniously chopped in half and any role this character potentially had is just erased from the movie which also makes his appearance in Ep.7 meaningless. Where does Rey come from? We're never told\\, and it doesn't matter because the Force seemingly picks anyone at random to be Force sensitive\\, so any idea of Rey being special is thrown out. She just happened to be at the right place at the right time to be involved in any of this. Is Finn Ok? Yeah\\, he helps a bunch of giant cat horse things escape an alien casino then meaninglessly jeopardizes the Resistance during a hair-brained scheme that could have been avoided if the purple haired weirdo had just told Po that her super-secret plan was to make an escape attempt to a nearby planet the screen writers decided to put in when they wrote themselves in a corner. The film is marred with these plot holes and lapses in general reason and logic that leave you constantly questioning every single thing that anyone says or does during the entire movie.\\n\\nWhat happens in between the slowest intergalactic car chase sequence in history is completely inconsequential and serves virtually zero purpose to the story or the characters involved. In fact I would argue that the decisions the characters make are so illogical and questionable that it ruins any positive development that had previously been established for those characters. If I had to describe the film using one word it would be monotonous\\, it's tedious\\, and it lacks anything even remotely interesting. The worst part about all of this is that it bears the Star Wars brand and despite how terrible the movie was\\, box office records have been broken and inevitably another soulless\\, creatively bankrupt\\, toy pushing pile of excrement will be here Holiday 2019.","true":true}
