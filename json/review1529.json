Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long fan of StarWars and someone who read the Heir to the Empire series as well as other \\\"legends\\\" books in my youth\\, I have tried to stay with this new starwars cannon. I like Rey. I like Kylo. However\\, I don't like what Disney has done with the heroic Luke Skywalker. I was looking forward to the payoffs of what was setup in the force awakens. Now the introduction of Snoke and the death of Han Solo feels cheap and all the speculation and excitement about who Rey truly is was for nothing. Way to go Disney.","true":true}
