Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a good movie with a lame storyline.  It was written like a stand alone movie with contempt for previous films and neglect for future.  Rian Johnson took care of himself and turned the movie into a Breaking Bad episode.  Disney failed to protect the brand and the characters.  Not only did it not answer any questions meaningfully\\, but it left us without any going forward.  Lame.  Hey Disney\\, the dollars you see today are the result of Force Awakens.  Your dollars will diminish in the future because of this travesty.","true":true}
