Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the action sequences but the story is boring\\, the Finn-Rose subplot serves no purpose and none of the questions we had at the end of the Force awakens are answered. Like The Force Awakens it is a remake of The Empire Strikes back. We even have Yoda and a traitor. I almost expected the Resistance fleet to hide in a giant asteroid. Disney needs to bring back George Lucas fast because we are now sure to get a remake of Return of the Jed for Episode IXi... with lens flare.","true":true}
