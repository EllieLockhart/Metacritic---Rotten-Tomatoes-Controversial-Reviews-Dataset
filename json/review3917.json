Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Borderline unwatchable. Turned to the person next to me to confirm I wasn't alone in thinking this. He agreed and as a long time fan was visibly upset. I didn't really care for Star Wars before but this made me sad that I gave them money. Won't happen again.","true":true}
