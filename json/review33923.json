Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. So Luke \\\"The Jedi Master\\\" has been turned into someone that kills their nephew while he is sleeping\\, and oh yeah explain that one to your sister Leia and supposed best friend Han. Has anyone thought what a cowardly move in any regard much less a Jedi. What about sadness turing hate and all that stuff leading to the dark side? The entire scene at the casino and with Benecio was pointless and seemed to be written in just to have a part for del Toro. By the way I go to Star Wars movies to be entertained\\, not educated or preached to about pc issues that anyone with a brain should already know. Kylo Ren should have started as Ben sans mask then morphed to Kylo with the mask Terrible\\, terrible job by Rian Johnson.","true":true}
