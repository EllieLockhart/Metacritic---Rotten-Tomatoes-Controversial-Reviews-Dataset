Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what's the point of killing off luke and making rey the last jedi? this movie failed to make me care for the new characters and now that luke is gone why should i go see the next? also\\, disney is so stupid for not having a reunion scene of the 3 original stars. really? kill off han in 7\\, kill off luke in 8\\, obviously leia is going to die in 9. such a stupid trilogy overall and a big insult to the real fans","true":true}
