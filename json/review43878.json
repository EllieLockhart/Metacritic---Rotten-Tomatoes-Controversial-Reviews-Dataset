Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Those complaints of The Force Awakens being a rehash of A New Hope are put to rest with The Last Jedi. This is a great film that takes risks leading the franchise in a bold new direction. The film is visually stunning. The real stand out performances are ones unexpected with Laura Dern and Oscar Issac really shining and making us truly care about their fates and choices. The Last Jedi really shines\\, and after first viewing it will take the Star Wars fans time to digest what they've seen and felt. It may even require another viewing to get a grasp on the whole experience. This was by far the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
