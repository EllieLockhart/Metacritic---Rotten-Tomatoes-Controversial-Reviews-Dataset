{"101487":133743,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have mixed feelings about this movie\\, the first time I saw it I wasn't satisfied. The reason for that was that I had too big expertations. By the second time I liked it a lot better. Thing I didn't like we're the extreme left sjw nonsens. The resistence is just ruled by woman and gives the impression that females are superior to men and the First order are only fachist white people. This kind of politics should not be part of Star Wars! The movie has also a lot of plot holes\\, How can Rey be so strong in force skills when she had barely no training! Thats in contradiction with the rules of Star Wars\\, you need to be a padawan and practice a lot. A lot of questions are not answered. Also this following ships through hyperspace is kinda tricky. Last but not leased the humor didn't work sometimes\\, I liked the milkingscene that was kinda funny and very luke\\, because he used to be a farm boy\\, the porgs I realy hate like jar jar in EP 1. The bookburningscene I did not like as a christian and historian\\, you dont burn ancient texts! It just saw it the 2nd time that Rey had them stolen!\\n\\nThing I liked a lot in this movie are the spiritual elements (Prime Jedi and the force lesson to Rey by Luke at the rock)\\, Yoda's return\\, the caretakers (christian nuns at the temples on Arch-to)\\,the Raylofight against Snoke and Cantonica (Canto Bight). About Cantonica\\, I found it a funny part of the movie\\, because I didn't hate the prequels. \\n\\nMy favorite SW movies are EP2\\, EP3 and Rogue One. By Ep2 and 3\\, I was in my early 20's . For the originals I was too young to see them in theatres ( I'm from 1982). Lukes passing was very beautiful\\, because he really was intoduced by the two moons scene at Tatooine and died at a sunset on Arch-to\\n\\nSo I would say this movie had some good elements\\, but also bad elements","true":true}
