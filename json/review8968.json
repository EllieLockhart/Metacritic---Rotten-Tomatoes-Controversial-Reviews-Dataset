Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From flying space nuns\\, to scenes where nothing got accomplished\\, but to waste time and put more scenery in the movie\\, to obvious ideological beliefs of the director and president of Lucasarts being shoved down our throats\\, this movie severely dissapointed me.  The writer and director basically disregarded all prior lore and canon and physics to push his own story on this utter garbage.  If you truly want to watch this movie\\, watch it for free somehow and do not give money to Disney for this trash.","true":true}
