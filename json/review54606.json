Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry\\, but Rae the actress that is does not fit with the roll. She does not command her role. She has no cool lines to say. Nothing to remember. They screwed up the character of Luke terribly. They killed off the main bad guy. Snoke was only a live for such a short. Of time. No character development. Ray had no character development. It was just a Disney action flick. People only like Ray because she's cute women and men alike. The only characters I really liked were the bad guys. Finn stinks to High Heavens acting-wise and roll wise. Poe could have been much better with better directing and a better plot. Overall it's just a base action flick almost in the B Movie category. If you like it\\, the bar you set is very low. For myself and so many others\\, we will never watch this again. I've watched a New Hope a dozen times or more along with Empire Strikes Back along with the Return of the Jedi. I've even watched The Phantom Menace a few times even though it wasn't very good at all yet it did have good parts however few. I need a strong male role\\, in addition\\, to lead an action movie as epic as Star Wars. Just compare the difference between Princess Leia and Ray. Worlds Apart.","true":true}
