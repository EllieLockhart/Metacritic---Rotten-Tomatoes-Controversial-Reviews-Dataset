Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was over-hyped from the beginning\\, & that doesn't help. I don't have time to rant like I normally would\\, so I'm going to detail my top gripes in bullet point-form. \\n\\n- Luke died without ever showcasing the strength of the most powerful Jedi\\n- The Finn & Rose side quest & romance to CasinoRoyale was pointless\\n- Chrom Trooper was again\\, a weak character\\n- Benicio Del Toro's character was not interesting enough for a 1\/done appearance\\n- Admiral Holdo was uncharismatic on screen\\, although allegedly an interesting character if you read StarWars novels.. \\n- Leia not only didn't die after being sucked into space\\, but instead Mary Poppins-ed to the nearest space-door. \\n- Snoke seemingly died a pointless death\\n\\nAwesome things about this movie\\n- Music\\n- Alien Puffins\\n- Rey & Kylo fighting as a team","true":true}
