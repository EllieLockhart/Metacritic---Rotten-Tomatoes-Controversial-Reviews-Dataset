Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand critics\\, but the film is still great. I like films that divide the audience because truth if it exists is never \\\"easy\\\" to comprehend. This film puts mainly into the light the \\\"psychological evolution\\\" of Luke and shows how much humans are naturaly imperfect yet get to perfection\\, illumination\\, after... a true let go. Go and read buddhism to understand this !","true":true}
