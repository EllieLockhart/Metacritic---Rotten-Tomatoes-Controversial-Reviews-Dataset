Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2\/10. Amazing special effects\\, the first and last scenes are amazing. However\\, in the middle\\, the moronic subplots\\, characters that you can't bring yourself to care about\\, and the childish jokes that kill all notions of tension. I could go longer about promblems with this thing\\, but I don't wan't to spoil it for those that still care.","true":true}
