Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The eighth installment in the Star Wars saga is a rousing crowd pleaser\\, with the late Carrie Fisher reprising her role as Princess Leia\\, aided by a reluctant Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in their rebellion against the evil galactic empire. Director Rian Johnson deftly retains the look and feel of its predecessors\\, while updating the 40 year old franchise with some surprising plot twists\\, new characters\\, eye popping action sequences that have just the right amount of CGI\\, and cute critters for the kids. The only weaknesses are the length (it starts to drift by the third act) a few ridiculous moments\\, and Adam Driver\u2019s not so convincing portrait of villainous Kylo Ren. Still\\, it\u2019s great fun and its homage to the original film in the final scenes is quite the \u201cawww\u201d moment.
