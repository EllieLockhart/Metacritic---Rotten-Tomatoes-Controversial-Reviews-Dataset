Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't a bad movie.  It is a travesty and an abomination.  I did not care about the plot or the characters.  There is a social justice theme\\, with all of the female characters flawless and all of the males dolts.  I like a strong female character but these ones were not believable.  Nice to see Luke\\, but he dies from using the Force?  No new songs.  Remember how you used to get tingles from hearing the theme of the force during a special Star Wars moment?  Not anymore -- they play it every ten minutes.  Wow this was such a travesty.  I certainly won't be seeing any more of these movies.","true":true}
