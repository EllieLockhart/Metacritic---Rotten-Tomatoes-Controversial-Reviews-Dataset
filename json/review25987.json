Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothin more i can say about this film\\, it was purposely design so that the lore in the film no longer exist\\, old character who we as a fans love just die off in the most pathetic way. mid section stuck with some most unnecessary romance running time. Clearly those section can cut off complete if one of the character just need share the crucial plan for the survival of the rebellion to some hot headed fool. i still give this a 2 star because i still love some scene in this movie\\, but it killed off all my intention to see the next film\\, this might well be the last film in the series at all. i dont wan to see a whining annoying child as the villain who do not bring anything to the story beside screaming bashing like a child.","true":true}
