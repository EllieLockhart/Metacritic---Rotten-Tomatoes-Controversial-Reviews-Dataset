Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's start off by saying this Star Wars movie will crush fans of the original trilogy! The plot was subpar and the jokes at times seemed out of place.  This movie seemed to be more about our world's own social and political injustices\\, than an escape to a galaxy far\\, far\\, away. Disney needs to understand that we go to the movies for excitement\\, adventure and at times to simply escape. Sure most movies are predictable\\, but sometimes that's a good thing. Let's face it\\, the writers of this film had a lot of explaining to do. Part VII's story had more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese. As a Star Wars fan I was really looking forward to learning more about the new character's they introduced in the last film. Another swing and a miss for the Star Wars franchise. As Mark Hamill stated \\\"I fundamentally disagree about everything they did with my character\\\". After watching this\\, I think most original trilogy fans would agree with this statement. The problem with these new character's is that they are not Iconic like the original's. If any of them were killed off in the film's you wouldn't bat an eye. At times this just didn't really feel like a Star Wars movie. Simply put: Snoke is a joke\\, the first order need to invest in faster ships\\, and the resistance just needs to disappear to a galaxy far\\, far\\, away. I understand that they are trying to make Star Wars for the next generation of fans\\, but at what cost. You didn't have to destroy our beloved character's in the process. As Kylo Ren stated in the film \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it\\\"!  Well\\, Disney you have succeeded!  As for me and most original fans out there\\, Star wars officially ended at Return of the Jedi... Thank you George Lucas for bringing us true joy\\, excitement and adventure! There will never be a better galaxy far\\, far away!","true":true}
