Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a mega fan. Read 60+ Expanded Universe books\\, addicted to both SW animated Series\\, and I freakin love every SW movie- yes even THE PREQUELS. The Last Jedi however is a liberal push to paint fair skinned males as evil\\, failures\\, and inherently bad in general. #typical.of.them\\nThere are so many plots holes that even I can't defend them all.  The fact that Johnson is in charge of the next trilogy installment is terrifying to me.\\nThis movie was a huge let down.","true":true}
