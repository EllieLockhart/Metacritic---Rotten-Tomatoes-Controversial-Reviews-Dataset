Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: \\nI really enjoyed this movie I want to go back and watch it again.  It takes risks fakes you out and makes you think. Most importantly it reminds you that it doesn't matter who your family is. You don't need to be a Skywalker to be special.","true":true}
