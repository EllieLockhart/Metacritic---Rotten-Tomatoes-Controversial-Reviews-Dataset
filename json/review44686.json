Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To the people leaving negative reviews: just because a film isn't what you thought it was going to be doesn't make it at all bad. In fact it's the surprises that make the last Jedi so remarkable.","true":true}
