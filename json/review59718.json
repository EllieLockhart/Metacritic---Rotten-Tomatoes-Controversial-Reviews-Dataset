While the game received marginal improvements\\, most notably in graphics and combat mechanics\\, it failed in delivering one key factor that made the first Last of Us great ; the story.\r\rMost of the character felt out of sync when compared to the first title and new characters are even more difficult to relate\\, making the game feel like a mess at best. especially considering this is the sequel of the beloved first Last of Us.\r\rI never wanted this game to be trashed like this\\, as I adored the first one\\, and I think the same goes to other fans of this franchise. But seeing how things have unfold\\, I really wanted to give a reminder to them that this isn't how you carry the legacy of a game that so many loved and admired for its character\\, world-building and storytelling. They mishandled all the wait after 7 years like they mishandled their character in the sequel.\r\rAt the end of the day\\, instead of feeling like a love letter \\, this feels like a huge middle finger to the first game. And I think this justifies why a lot of people are upset. Anyway that's what I've come to believe and I think that's enough.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
