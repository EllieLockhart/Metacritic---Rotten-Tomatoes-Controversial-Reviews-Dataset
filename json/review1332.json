Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A return to character development\\, some humor\\, and a good old fashioned movie that didn't rely on special effects (and it had some very good ones) to rank as an excellently movie.","true":true}
