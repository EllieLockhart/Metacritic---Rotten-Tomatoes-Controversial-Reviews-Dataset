Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perfect\\, so far the only star wars film since the original trilogy that pays homage to the originals\\, while developing new uncharted territory. Stunning character based dialogue\\, in learly based on the same theology as the originals\\, and completely fresh and unexpected.","true":true}
