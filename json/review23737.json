Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker\\, a man who defied Obiwan and Yoda and laid down his light saber rather than fight his father\\, Darth Vader (murderer of millions as well as children)\\, because there was a chance to turn him back....Now decides on a whim to kill his nephew  he has none all his life in his sleep as a child because he senses evil.....add in 1.5 hours of useless story arc\\, ships that run out of gas\\, milking aliens\\, Mary Sue\\, and Superman Leia.....this is the worst star wars film ever.....and a totally bad sci-fi film in general.","true":true}
