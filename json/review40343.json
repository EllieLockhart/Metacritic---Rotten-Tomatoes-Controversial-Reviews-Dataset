Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of those rare times that the low audience score is BS.  I would bet many low votes are from those who didn't even watch the movie and had political preference against some of the feminist and other themes.  I personally am not a fan of any of the forced diversity of color\\, promotion of ill timed notions of peace in the midst of a war(whatever that was when the one girl bumped the former storm trooper out of the way of the door blaster)\\, and then the men are generally childish and foolish theme throughout.  But I knew that was coming.  \\n\\nI did not know Yoda was appearing for a proper segment\\, that Luke was going to pull the ultimate Jedi trick of all time before being enlightened like Buddha\\, or that Rey was going to be a better character than I had hoped (she is the one I enjoy the most in this series).  \\n\\nAnyone rating this less than 4 stars is thinking too much and forgets it's simply about the experience.  I can't give it 5\/5 because some of the politicizing just didn't make sense (just like in real life)\\, but I enjoyed the experience and it was definitely worth the money\\, which is more than I can say for a lot of the movies released recently.","true":true}
