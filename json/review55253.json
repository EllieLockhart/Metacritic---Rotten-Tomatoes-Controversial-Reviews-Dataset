Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kudos to the critics that held their ground and weren't bought or intimidated by Disney. 93% is embarrassing. Rotten Tomatoes is a site that I've always respected for having high standards. Simply not fair to the brilliant movies that were scored truthfully and rank lower than this pile of trash.\\n\\nThe film is a cringe-fest from start to finish. PLEASE don't waste you hard earned money. Disney & Johnson do not deserve to get paid for killing Star Wars! Everything you love about the old films will be tainted by TLJ. Please head my warning and leave it pure.\\n\\nI barely know who you are Rian Johnson\\, but after watching TLJ it's quite clear that this was a joke to you. And for that I wish to say this: F**k you.\\n\\nWhat a tragedy.","true":true}
