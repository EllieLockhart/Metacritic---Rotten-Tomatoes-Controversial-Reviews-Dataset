Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"La peor pel\u00edcula de la saga y con diferencia. Es tediosa\\, llena de absurdos e incongruencias\\, copia exactamente igual escenas del episodio 5 y 6\\, desperdicia personajes ridiculiza a otros\\, pareciera que ahora cualquiera puede ser jedi sin esforzarse en lo mas minimo. Llena con una buena porci\u00f3n de humor innecesario.","true":false}
