Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Soooo terrible.  I don't even know where to begin. There are a lot of well articulated reviews of this\\, but the through large chunks of the plot to the wind to fulfill some SJW agenda was just terrible. Life long fan of Star Wars.  But I just stopped being one. Disney isn't going to get any more money from me.","true":true}
