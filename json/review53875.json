Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\,  this was a good movie but so many people have criticised it\\,  however even with 1 or 2 plot holes people have been missing what was BETTER about this movie and the force awakens.  The music was SO much better in this\\,  the story with the little teasers were great!  However I am 100% against the new love interest for po\\,  she is such an empty and holo character that didn't need to be in the movie at all!","true":true}
