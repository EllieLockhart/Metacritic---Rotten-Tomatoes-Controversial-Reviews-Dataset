Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very enjoyable\\, different take on the Skywalker saga. I don't know what the 'fans' are talking about. Yes there are some odd bits in the film\\, some jokes that don't really land\\, but this doesn't take away from it being a great film. It's is beautifully made\\, with some great acting\\, and while Leia's force pull through space is a bit naff\\, I really enjoyed the subversion of our expectations for these characters we think we know.","true":true}
