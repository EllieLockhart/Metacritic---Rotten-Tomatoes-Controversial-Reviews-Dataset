Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second worst Star Wars film created (only better than VII because VII set up the folly of VIII and wasn't a complete remake of V). A terrible story\\, horrible character development\\, and useless story arcs are only the beginning of the criticism of the film. Plot holes and plot set-ups were entirely dropped and the story veered down a predictable and childish route\\, along with the humor. VII and especially VIII try to mimic the success George Lucas saw with the original trilogy\\, but end up making a cliche\\, knockoff parody of the originals. The traditional view of the Force has been all but abandoned and the original characters morphed into completely different utterances of themselves - pathetic might I add. The film was a great disappointment and the franchise is becoming like the Marvel movies where there will be a couple of good films (Rouge One)\\, but 80% of them will be complete trash (VII sand VIII). I mourn the death of Star Wars and I hope Disney repents of their terrible actions they've made.","true":true}
