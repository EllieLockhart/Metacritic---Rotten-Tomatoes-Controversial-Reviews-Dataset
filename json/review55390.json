Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love this film. Takes all your expectations and turns them upside down. Perhaps it takes it too far but that's what makes it exciting and unpredictable. That and almost total lack of fan service is what divides the fans. But for me\\, a huge star wars fan my entire life\\, this film is outstanding and jaw dropping. This is both Luke's movie and not his movie. It's time to move on from the originals and embrace Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn\\, Poe and the rest. (Carrie Fisher is stunning\\, heartwarming\\, and all around amazing).","true":true}
