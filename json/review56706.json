Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most divisive Star Wars film became the battleground for the soul of fandom and now that the dust has settled\\, its easier to evaluate its glories and its flaws. It feels focused grouped to death in some respects and then widely experimental in others\\, featuring some of the most exciting and heartbreaking moments in the franchise as well as a few groaners. But whatever flaws it may have\\, all is forgiven in one of the greatest Deus Ex Machinas in cinematic history. There\u2019s never been a Star Wars picture quite like this\\, and if the fallout from it is any indication it will be a while before there\u2019s another.","true":true}
