Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated the Disney commercial at the very end. I must say Kylo Ren is the real star of these movies. I have little interest in Rey.
