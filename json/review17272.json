Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like it\\, I really did. The special effects studios that worked on this deserve and oscar. However\\, The plot was weak an overly contrived without need. Soundtrack and visuals were great\\, but putting a good soundtrack and good visuals on incoherent garble does not a good movie make. Disney your better than this. Rogue One was so much more that this.","true":true}
