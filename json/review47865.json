Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start with this utter dumpster fire. Luke's character is completely wrong\\, you don't go from seeing tiny sliver of good in your father risking your own life to turn him back to the light\\, to almost murdering your nephew in his sleep because you sense some bad in him. The Leia blown out into space death fake out was terrible\\, using the force to float back in\\, so much cringe. With Carrie Fishers death why wouldn't you order re-shoots\\, not that a fake out like this should have been in there at all. There is plenty lifted visuals\\, themes lifted from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Rian Johnson said this movie would surprise me\\, well it did\\, in that it took all my worst fears for the movie and put them on screen. We have side quests with no payoff which are clearly just there as filler. New characters that are introduced who we aren't able to care for because there is no character development. Take Vice Admiral Holdo as an example\\, she is so poorly developed that I actually had to look up who the hell that character was\\, a first for a Star Wars film as a fan. How can I possibly care about her \\\"noble sacrifice\\\" when I have had no time to get to know this character or reason to like her. Snoke and his death were both totally underwhelming\\, apparently he was just some random from no where we shouldn't have concerned ourselves with. No doubt Kylo Ren's murder of Snoke was an attempt to make Kylo seem like a badass now\\, that is not how it comes across. Every big question you had about the characters goes thoroughly unsatisfied. The casino planet side quest\\, heck I thought that would form a major destination where there would be some sort of Bond style gambling scene apparently not\\, what an absolute waste. The pacing of the film is terrible\\, TFA\\, RO\\, and TLJ all suffer from having to do everything at a mile a minute\\, will these people go back and watch the Original Trilogy it isn't all action\\, in fact there is actually very little action in the original films. There is so much negative weighing against this film I will leave others to that. Sure had pretty good action and looked great\\, but a nicely formed turd is still a turd.","true":true}
