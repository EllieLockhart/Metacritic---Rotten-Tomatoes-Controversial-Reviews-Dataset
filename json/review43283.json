Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fabulous middle movie. Ties up some stuff from XII and lay some ground for IX. Too many people try to project what their ideal movie would be instead of enjoying the movie that was made. maybe you would have done something different\\, but you didn't make the movie. I want to dock it a little for all the last minute saves\\, but that is how all TV and movies are these days.","true":true}
