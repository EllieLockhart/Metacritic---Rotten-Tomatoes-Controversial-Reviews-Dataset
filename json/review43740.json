Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most Un-Star Wars movie of the series. Been a favorite of mine since I was a little kid\\, and Disney has done to Star Wars what I was afraid they\u2019d do to Star Wars. The plot was pretty light and steered the story in a new direction and the franchise is really Star Wars by name only now. I think I\u2019m punching out. Don\u2019t really care what happens in the next movie. Sad!","true":true}
