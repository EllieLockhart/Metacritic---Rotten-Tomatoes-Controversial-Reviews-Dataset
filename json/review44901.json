{"101487":190410,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-01","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars A third of a good film.\\n\\nI have never reviewed a film on RT before\\, but since people are suggesting that the low audience scores are somehow 'faked' I felt compelled to put in a review. I have noticed the score is slow dropping even more\\, and I think it it better than there are more reviews out there to get a better idea from regular folks. I think the high score from the critics is suspicious\\, not the low score from the audience!\\n\\nEven though I grew up with the original trilogy\\, and TESB is my favourite\\, I also really like the 2 out of the three prequels. \\nI found the Phantom Menace a bit boring\\, but I think AOTC and ROTS are great. Those three films technically achieved a lot more to modern films than people remember. Huge battle scenes before LOTRs and Hobbits\\, CGI characters before Avatar\\, and the digital film revolution.  \\nThe six films told a complete and amazing story\\, which changed as George Lucas did\\, but ended up being very interesting. The prequels changed the way one views the original trilogy\\, as it make it obvious that the old style Jedi ddi not work. It made the story of Darth radar retroactively so much more interesting. ROTS made ROTJ a much more interesting film to watch\\, albeit\\, probably largely by accident! I loved the echoes of story beats\\, but at the same time there was so much original set and character design. Yes\\, some of the acting was flat\\, and some of the lines corny. There were some inconsistencies and weird choices (Darth Vader made CSPO?) but overall i think it it the most complete and incredible of film series.\\n\\nI was very excited when I heard the great reviews from critics for TLJ\\, and relieved. I desperately want to like a Star Wars film. And I want everyone one else to like them with me!\\n\\nBut after seeing this film\\, even with the least spoilers of any star wars movie\\, I was left feeling empty and confused. I saw it a second time hoping I would enjoy it a lot more. I like it slightly more\\, but not much.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens\\, while derivative of ANH\\, was fun and exciting. I thought the Resistance\/First Oder dynamic didn't make much sense\\, but the pace and new character interactions made you forget this.  It ended so full of promise\\, and the teasers and ads for this next film made it look pretty good.\\n\\nThe good things about this film include the cinematography. The production design was impressive\\, with more originality than TFA. Some of the effects were great\\, some of the CGI on Canto Bight looked pretty blah. The acting varied from great to poor. Many of the lines were clever or funny. The soundtrack is fantastic. \\n\\nAll of John Williams SW scores are great\\, but this one was much more fun to listen to on it's own than most of the others. I think this is because the he has such a wonderful bank of incredible themes\\, as they play it is a joy to listen to. Some of the best were themes from the TFA\\, which have now become classics\\, such as Poe's theme\\, Jedi steps\\, Kylo Ren's theme (played much better this time)\\, and of course Rey's inspiring tune which i think has grown on everybody now. I was a bit confused by the full on playing of the Emperor's theme during a Snoke sequence. Is that telling us something? \\n\\nI really enjoyed the Luke\\, Kylo\\, Ren and Snoke story. However\\, the other two story threads were not very good. The fleet chase was average and frustrating. The Canto Bight story was illogical and heavy handed. The three new characters were not enjoyable as the new characters in TFA. And the characters from the film were not as likeable in this film. This is nothing to do with racism or sexism or some less observant people are suggesting; the new characters in TFA were a woman\\, a latin American and a black man\\, but they ere all GOOD characters! The new characters is this movie are annoying and unlikeable!\\n\\nI really like most of the Luke\/Rey\/Kylo story. This alone would have made a great film. The Ach-Too training was fine\\, with some funny and dramatic moments. I liked Luke being so screwed up that he is drinking and dribbling space walrus milk. The force Skype moments were very well done. The chemistry between Kylo and Rey was slightly dangerously sexual and very well done. The team up between the two and the killing of Snoke was a clever 'twist' and fun. Snoke wasn't a very interesting character and killing the emperor equivalent was a smart and fresh choice. The ensuing light sabre fight was great fun\\, and included a moment that every kid imagined doing; igniting a light share into someone to impale them (although I guess Kylo did that to Han in the last film). The reveal of Rey's parents was clever and true to the previous film (I think we as audience just assumed she was related to sone one\\, and the films played that up). Luke projecting himself was set up previously and was quite clever. The stand up to the bad fleet with a laser sword moment was a good callback to earlier in the film . I didn't feel as emotional with his death scene as the film was suggesting I should. Rey levitating rocks was a clever callback to TESB and earlier in this film  \\n\\nThe 'slow' fleet chase did make a lot of sense. Why not just light speed ahead and destroy the rest of the fleet. There was too much techno babble to make story points work. The idea that Poe is now dangerous was strange\\, and forced to make a 'character arc'. The as-usual-not-great-actor Laura Dern played the annoying Holdo character. It didn't doesn't make sense that they would not tell the previous hero of the resistance. The blowing out of General Leia was a surprise but her gliding back was awful\\, even with John Williams amazing music and that great theme\\, it didn't work. The Maz phone call was silly. The light speed crash was impressive of course. (Don't forget George played a similar trick twice in the awesome asteroid chase with silence and then a plucked string effect in AOTC!)\\n\\nThe casino plant should not have occurred had characters communicated in the previous story thread. This is a old sitcom trope. The character of Rose was inconsistent and annoying. (The character of her sister seemed more likeable in 5 minutes). The themes of animal cruelty and rich people and poor kids was so corny! The animal chase was boring and silly. The CGI characters were pretty awful. The 'safe cracker was meant to be a unique person\\, yet by coincidence they find their cellmate with equal skills. Why was he in jail? There is not will of the force here; these are not the main characters.\\n\\nWhen everyone came back together\\, the best storyline was still good\\, and the Poe and Fin storylines were still bad. Poe's \\\"there is no way out of here\\, wait there is a back entrance\\\" was pretty corny. Rose stopping Finn from his moment seemed strange. i kind of get what they are going for\\, but it just didn't work very well. The kiss was awkward!\\n\\nAll three new characters were unlikeable. The classic characters of C3PO\\, R2D2 and Chewbacca had one great scene each (R2 with a a cheap shot\\, Chewie trying to have a chew)\\, But they felt a bit left out. Not a huge deal\\, but strange. \\n\\nIt wasn't a terrible movie\\, it just wasn't a FUN and GREAT movie like I think most other SW movies are. \\n\\nI feel sorry for JJ having to change things again. But i feel really sorry for George Lucas who didn't receive enough kudos for the prequels.\\n\\nThe film Rogue One was OK. I didn't expect a lot from it as it was not what I considered a 'main' saga film.\\nThis film confirms that there is no larger story arc and they are just making it up with each film. I find that a bit boring. And each director will do there own version. That might work for a television show\\, but for an ongoing saga\\, it is annoying.\\nSo for the first time in 37 years I am not really looking forward to the next Star Wars movie.\\nI think that the Marvel movies with their forward planning\\, and to a lesser extant the DC movies\\, are the equivalent of the two previous Star Wars trilogies.\\n\\nCurrently this film is still sitting at 50%. I find it hard to believe it is that high from reading the comments here.","true":true}
