Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a movie full of surprises. Some worked\\, others didn't\\, but I enjoyed the film. This was the first Star Wars Movie I walked out of without a definitive opinion of until I thought about the movie. My mind was buzzing with all the turns the story took and where it might go. The point of this film is to show the audience that they're not doing the same story as the originals and instead paving the way for new possibilities. I'm genuinely interested in how this trilogy is going to end.","true":true}
