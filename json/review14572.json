Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a hardcore fan of Star Wars  my hole life... Beautifully shot film\\, but movie is totally disappointing. Remember everyone: Critic reviews are not true at all. Fake news. Just good reviews for free items.. come on \\\"top Critics\\\". Disney has officially ruined Star Wars and George Lucas legacy period.","true":true}
