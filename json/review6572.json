Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Doesn't fit in canon. Ackbar just dies an unceremonious death\\, Leia somehow flies in space\\, defying all previous canon which Disney disrespectfully destroyed. Should have used books as source material\\, instead we get this overhyped dribble.. Sad to think this may be John Williams last film. I also agree with Hamill when it comes to the direction Luke has supposedly taken\\, becoming one with the force. I don't think it was time and you risked losing the nostalgia factor\\, which you did. Props on the space battle scene in the beginning\\, phenomenal job with the sisters connection. I'm not a total snob! ;)","true":true}
