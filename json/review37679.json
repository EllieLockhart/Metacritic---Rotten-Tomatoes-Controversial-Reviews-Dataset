Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's like no way critics can be seeing the same movie I\\, and all the audience members here and at my showing last night\\, have seen.\\n\\nI came into this VERY excited. TFA was a pretty solid movie\\, all things considered\\, but it *was* just aping Lucas' original. That's fine\\, because it still had a good sense of wonder and posed some good questions for viewers to ask then the credits rolled. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi takes all those questions you had and does the \\\"AAANNNNND it's gone\\\" thing from South Park. The movie starts right off the bat with slapstick humor and was just NOT Star Wars. Say what you want about the prequels but they still had a sense of mystery and the unknown at the beginnings of TPM and AOTC\\, specifically. TLJ is cracking jokes within 15 sec of putting people on screen\\, it's just bizarre. The jokes don't hit\\, either! The iron gag was probably the only one I liked\\, and even then\\, unnecessary. \\n\\nSooo many story problems I can't even count. All of a sudden you can live in space? Ghosts can summon lightning? Characters with minimal training go from just \\\"attuned\\\" to stronger than Yoda\/Dooku\\, far as rock lifting ability? I guess just chalk it up to the new \\\"Disney Force(TM)\\\"\\, which is now just like Marvel powers\\, I guess? The timing of the \\\"18 hr. chase\\\" - which is a slow crawl through space running slower than the opening crawl - interwoven with Rey's scenes which are seemingly days\\, hell\\, weeks apart... Her parents and Snoke's backstory just swept aside\\, likely to never be answered\\, Finn\/Rose's boring an unnecessary thread\\, the stupid casino shit... most of all though\\, even though Hamill turns in a great performance\\, the character of Luke is butchered. It's been mentioned but\\, where did the can-do attitude Luke had from the OT go\\, actually? When you find out why Luke is so reclusive and troubled\\, it's just... a letdown. It makes him a villain-for-a-minute and is totally out of character. After all he went through in ROTJ to turn his father\\, a way more badass guy than Kylo\\, and all of sudden he considers murdering his nephew because he senses a \\\"darkness\\\" that he just *knows* he won't be able to quell? Please. Vader had much more darkness than Kylo Ren\\, and we don't even have legit reasons for why Kylo Ren is so fucked up\\, he just is (yet another unanswered question first seeded in TFA). \\n\\nI seriously liked every prequel better. Can't believe I just wrote that.\\n\\nI seriously like every prequel better than this miscarriage.","true":true}
