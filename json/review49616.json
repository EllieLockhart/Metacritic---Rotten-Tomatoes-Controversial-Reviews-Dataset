Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. The audience isn't lying. The Last Jedi is worse than The Last Airbender. This movie is not only one of the worst movies I've ever seen\\, it commits heresies and crimes against the original trilogy. \\n\\nMany reviewers have rightfully concluded that this movie is vandalism. The biggest mistake Disney made was attempting to vandalize Luke Skywalker's legacy. \\n\\nMany reviewers have also concluded that this is NOT a REAL Star Wars sequel\\, and they are right. This is not what George Lucas had planned for Luke Skywalker. This movie will never be accepted as \\\"canon\\\" by true fans of the original three movies.","true":true}
