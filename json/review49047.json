Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie by far\\, looks like Rian Johnson didn't know anything about the previous movies. Luckily Disney got what it deserved with the failure of Solo\\, a Star Wars Story.","true":true}
