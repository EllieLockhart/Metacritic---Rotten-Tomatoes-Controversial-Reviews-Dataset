Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The continuity between episode 7 and 8 is just a mess. Things that were established in 7 and just abandoned in 8\\, just to subvert expectations but in reality is just the hallmark of bad story telling. I disliked how as an audience member I have to know that it's the differing vision of the directors between the movies. As an audience member there should be a seamless coherent vision between the films. SPOILERS: Why did Luke even make the map in episode 7 if he's complaining about how he's never going to leave that island in episode 8. Why bother making the map? Or Rey's parents lineage being built up a lot\\, only to be dashed in 8. Just a mess\\, not a fan.","true":true}
