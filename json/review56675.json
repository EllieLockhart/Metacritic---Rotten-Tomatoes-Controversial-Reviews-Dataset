Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was incredibly entertaining and as a fan felt it represented Star Wars in its fullest. The pacing was just right and acting was very good. I am still processing all that I just saw and feel it will definitely need a couple more viewings for me to full absorb it all. Rian Johnson has a hit in my opinion!","true":true}
