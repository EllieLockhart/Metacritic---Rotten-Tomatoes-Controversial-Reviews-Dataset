Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outside of the admittedly slow character development in the first half of the movie (developments necessary to make the second half of the movie so incredibly compelling)\\, the movie provides all the exciting action sequences\\, nostalgic throwbacks\\, and emotional momentum to satisfy most and get us excited for the next installment.","true":true}
