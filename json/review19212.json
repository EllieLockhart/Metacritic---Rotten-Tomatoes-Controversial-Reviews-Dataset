Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like watching someone tearing apart your favorite childhood toy\\, piece by piece\\, until you cannot recognize it. To make it worse\\, you paid money to watch it.\\nAll the characters\\, including Luke Skywalker\\, were mere plot driving machines. \\n1. Finn was as disappointing as expected. \\n2. Poe Dameron did nothing but barking his lines against everyone\\, and he became the leader. No wonder the resistance was losing their battle. \\n3. The rebels looked like a bunch of ideology-driven fanatics (in the last scene\\, the small group reminded me of Castro and his followers in 1953). 4. Admiral Holden was the worst among them. I love Laura Dern though\\, it was not her fault. \\n5. Snoke\\, poor Snoke\\, appeared like a mysterious monster\\, died like a dog. \\n6. Luke tried to kill Ben Skywalker? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\\n7. Rey must be stronger in the force than everyone has expected. She turned Like Skywalker's heart with no more than 10 sentences. That is the greatest Jedi mind trick I have every seen\\, casted on the greatest Jedi Master.\\n8. What was Benecio Del Toro's character (forgot his name) doing here? Trying to pull out the worst coaplay of Lando Calrissian ever? \\n9. Princess Leia becomes a flat propaganda symbol.\\n10. C-3PO was reduced to nothing.\\nAfter watching this movie\\, I dearly miss Jar Jar Binks.\\n\\nThe plot was as weird as the characters.\\n1. What is the galaxy Monte Carlo doing in this movie? Since when did anti-capitalism become the resistance's ideology? I thought it was about anti-repression since the battle of Yavin. \\n2. How could Leia survive after being blown out of the bridge of a space cruiser? If the force could be that strong\\, I feel really bad for those Jedi killed by gunshots on Geonosis.\\n3. The force theme was grossly overused. In EP4 it was really touching and inspiring when the boy Luke first felt his destiny. Here it was worth than nothing.\\n4. What is the point of creating all these stereotypical \\\"strong women\\\" character\\, only to make Poe Dameron the leader of the resistance? I am not sure about the politically correctness of this movie now.\\n5. Kylo Ren's fruedian internal crisis could be a good plot element\\, but the actor and the writer\/director killed it without mercy.\\n\\nJust like EP7 was an attempt to redo EP4\\, EP8 was also faintly an effort to recycle EP5. Alas\\, they failed. Disney is destroying this franchise\\, and they will succeed.","true":true}
