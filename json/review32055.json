Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers\\nI've never seen a franchise completely misunderstand its main protagonist like the way Luke was treated in The Last Jedi. Sure\\, I get that failure is the big theme here and even legends can fail\\, but they did in a way that was astronomically out of character. Luke doesn't turn his back on people. Even if he goes emo because of his failure with Kylo\\, that's traumatic enough to let the whole universe suffer as he tries to go into hiding forever? Nonsense. His 'conversion' scene is also dumb. Rey says I believe in you\\, and all of a sudden Luke has his conviction again. Completely unearned. But even when he does come back\\, it's another example of misdirection as he literally does nothing the audience hopes he will do. Rogue One had the Vader scene that blew the roof off the house. We want to cheer for our Star Wars characters!! This movie refused to portray Luke as anything other than an old man ready to die. So infuriating.","true":true}
