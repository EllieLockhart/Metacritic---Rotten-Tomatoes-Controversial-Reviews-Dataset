Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Are you joking\\, You spent 4 billion on a franchise and you forgot that you actually need to write a story that makes sense. (That flows) \\nStrong women!!!!  it takes experience to be strong this simply does not just occur. To be amazing at something takes effort even if you have talent. failing is part of life. We gave you the benefit of the doubt with The Force Awakens\\, but sorry. Your done.\\n\\nThere will be no more of my money for this crap. I am astounded that Rian Johnson still thinks he is wrote a great story.\\n\\nYou guys need a counselling session or two\\, you will definitely need it but the time you release Episode 9.\\n\\nGet some perspective.","true":true}
