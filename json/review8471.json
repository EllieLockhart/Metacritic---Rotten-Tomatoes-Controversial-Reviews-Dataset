Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got around to watching this on Redbox. I didn't understand the backlash\\, surely it couldn't be that bad. It was. The cinematography was gorgeous\\, but the story distracted from it. I didn't bother seeing this in the theater due to my disappointment with \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\" I won't bother watching the next one at all ... not even six months later on Redbox.","true":true}
