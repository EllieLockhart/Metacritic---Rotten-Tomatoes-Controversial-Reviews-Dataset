Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 Star for the great cinematic (graphics and camera work) experience but everything else was just awful. Just bad story. Random actions just thrown around just for the hope of a shock experience. A thesis can be written on why this movie was bad. Rotten Tomato rating is ridiculous 90%..really..I wonder who was paid for this. Just makes you wonder if anyone can use this site and trust it.","true":true}
