Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing was terrible and the plot devices were cringeworthy.\\nStarts off with bombers dropping bombs in space despite there not being gravity in space.  (Where did these bombers come from? If they had bombers they would have sent them against Star Killer base)\\nFrom there it's just plothole after plothole.\\nWhy didn't the First Order have fighters and support ships protecting their dreadnaught?\\nWhy didn't the bomber crewwoman die from exposure to space?\\nThey somehow miraculously come to the conclusion that they can be tracked through hyperspace. (Battlestar Galactica had a much better plot and chase scene)\\nWhat was the point in having a medical frigate when you can just heal everyone on the cruiser?\\nPoe just blew up a superweapon and a dreadnought\\, now you're demoting him for losing the crappiest bombers ever made.\\nThen Poe phones Maz because they need to get on the enemy dreadnought.\\nFinn and Rose go on a pointless side quest to some casino planet.\\nLeiah Mary Poppins herself back to life (NO ONE LIKED THIS SCENE).\\nAckbar is murdered unceremoniously.\\nSteal some space cows\\, wreck a few businesses.  Shortly after leaving the planet\\, all damages are recouperated through their insurance\\, the space cows are all recovered\\, and the slave children are savagely beaten for letting the space cows get stolen.\\nRey somehow learns the force on her own within a couple days with no training.\\nFinn and Rose get caught. Blah blah blah\\, BB-8 takes over an AT-ST and wrecks the place.\\nCode Breaker dude mysteriously knows that the Rebels are escaping.\\nRebel plan was to sneak to planet to phone for help (Even though Poe just demonstrated that they could call for help at any time)\\nAdmiral Gender Studies sends the cruiser to hyperspace ram the enemy capital ship\\, thus breaking every other Star Wars plot ever (coulda just rammed the death stars)\\nLuke goes to the (not)Hoth planet.\\nSurprise\\, he's a hologram.\\nSurprise\\, he has a force heart attack and dies for no reason.\\nRey lifts some rocks.\\nThe End.","true":true}
