Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing\\, I really liked episode 7.... and episode 8 does not expand on the mystery created by episode 7. Major plot holes\\, characters fade in and out of existence\\, the storyline jumps from scene to scene without grabbing the audience. Move over episode I\\, you have a contender for the worst Star Wars movie! ","true":true}
