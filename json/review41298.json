Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disgrace to the Skywalker saga. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard narrow it down but I can try. The absolute desecration of Luke Skywalker. The Casino Plot has no impact on the movie and is a waste of time. Forced social justice messages\\, i.e. Men are bad and are always mansplaining\\, dont eat animals\\, the jedi were bad because not everyone could be a jedi\\, the force is no longer special\\, The Story drags and the acting is sub par. I felt like I was watching the prequels. This movie is the anti - Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
