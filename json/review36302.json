Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Luke and Rey scenes are amazing. The opening and climactic scenes are great. As are the interactions between Rey\/Kylo Ren and Luke\/Kylo Ren. But the majority of the rest of he film felt like filler\\, like it didn't matter. And that's a damn shame for a 2 and a half hour long movie.","true":true}
