Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cringe inducing jokes and absurd plot twists take all the mystical flavor away from the most famous space opera. The director claims to be a Star Wars fan but clearly loved destroying The Force Awakens\\, mocking the prequels and giving Luke the role of a loser. Avoid it if you can!","true":true}
