Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson says he wasn't bound by any story arcs for this trilogy--and it shows.\\n\\nLuke's reaction to his old lightsaber is the perfect metaphor for the film. Everything that was built up in TFA\\, all of the mysteries we were left wondering about for two years\\, are promptly tossed aside. \\n\\nMost tragically\\, our greatest hero's morality is smeared\\, and he's given a shockingly boring and unsatisfying story line. The movie feels like it's trying to be shocking but this fails to substitute for poor writing. \\n\\nMuch of the story depends on an absurdly contrived plot device. And one battle tactic raises questions about why the rebels ever needed the plans to the death star.\\n\\nThis movie aggressively moves away from the stories established in the previous film--and all Star Wars films. But there is no payoff for all this shocking reenvisioning of Star Wars. \\n\\nBest since Empire? More like worst since Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
