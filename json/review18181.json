Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great. The fanboys bashing it are just doing what they do these days - crapping all over anything that doesn't meet the strict vision in their head for someone else's creative work. Is it the best Star Wars? No. Is it an entertaining\\, new take on the story that expands it rather than retreading it? Yes. Last time around\\, these fanboys complained that they just remade Episode IV. This time they do something new and break new ground\\, and they're furious that it doesn't mirror some youtube video's theory of who someone's parents were.","true":true}
