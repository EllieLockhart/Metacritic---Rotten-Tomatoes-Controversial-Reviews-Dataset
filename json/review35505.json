Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had so much to build off of from its predecessor\\, The Force Awakens. However\\, it is so focused on subverting expectations that it completely forgets about everything The Force Awakens set up\\, and after The Rise of Skywalker\\, it is basically irrelevant to the sequel trilogy. It takes the character of Luke Skywalker\\, and transforms him into something that the Luke fans knew from the original trilogy\\, could never be. Episode VIII is an amazing film to anybody watching as a casual viewer\\, and it certainly has its moments\\, but as a Star Wars film\\, it destroys everything that came before it\\, and ruins what has to follow it.","true":true}
