Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just another rehash of plot lines from the original trilogy.  Pretty clear that Disney is so mortified by the stink of the prequels that it is not taking risks with this trilogy and that's too bad for those us that fell in love with the rich star wars universe created by Lucas.  So many new themes and planets to explore!  For that\\, stick with Rogue One\\, a much better film.  \\n\\nZero character development outside of Kylo Ren. One strength of Force Awakens was JJ introducing these new characters that we great to care about but Johnson does very little to flesh them out.  Also\\, some of the comedy was good\\, but the timing was inappropriate.  Am I supposed to be afraid of the First Order or laugh at them?  Is this a serious fight for the galaxy or not? I left the theater disappointed and not very interested in what will happen to these characters in episode 9.","true":true}
