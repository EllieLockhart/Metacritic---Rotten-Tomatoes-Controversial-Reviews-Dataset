Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as force awakens or rouge one but miles ahead of the prequels. This is a good movie i will see multiple times.  The ending was emotionally satisfying and i think in time people will view this installment the same way some view Empire. Like empire i wouldnt recommend it if someone is only going to watch only one star wars movie \\, but in the context of force awakens and episode ix i think it will be beloved by all SW fans.","true":true}
