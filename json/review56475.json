Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is a huge disappointment to me primarily because of its portrayal of Luke Skywalker\\, who is unrecognisable compared to the character of the original trilogy. An utter betrayal of the character for no reason. Also\\, the central plot is poor\\, with key sub plots and character actions becoming pointless or worse by the end\\, the continued miraculous display of Force skill with no training by Rey is ridiculous and lazy.Power and innate ability does not equal control and skill. I like the character\\, but it is dumb and undermines her. The complete lack of explanation of key characters and developments is also utterly unsatisfactory. Why has Rian Johnson and Disney destroyed and made pointless the actions and successes of the Rebel Alliance and original characters? To provide this half baked rubbish? We lost the Canon of the extended universe for what?  A major part of what I loved about the original films\\, and even the disappointing prequels\\, was the presence of a discernable longer story arc\\, which is completely lacking in these new films in their eagerness to pump them out as fast as possible and print money.  Extremely and desperately disappointed.","true":true}
