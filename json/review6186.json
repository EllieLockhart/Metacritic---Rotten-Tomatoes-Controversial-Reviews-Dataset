Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has a knack for ruining everything.  If it's time to break from the past then why buy star wars in the first place.  This movie is awful.  Sure it looks good as they spent a lot of money on it but it lacks everything essential that makes it feel like a star wars movie.  Where is the Sith?  The first order is a joke and they made them a joke.  At no time did I feel that The universe was in peril from destruction.  Grandpa Vader will turn in his grave.","true":true}
