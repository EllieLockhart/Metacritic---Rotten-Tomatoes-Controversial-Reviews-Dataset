Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Disney movie\\, horrible Star Wars movie! Snoke ends up being nobody\\, so why was he even included in the films. Rey is a nobody\\, so why is she so powerful? And we did not get to see enough of Luke and his power. He is suppose to be a very powerful Jedi. We get one glimpse of it and then kill him off. I needed more. Definitely the best Star Wars movie based on cinematography\\, just left disappointed at the how they portray important characters.","true":true}
