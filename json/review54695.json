Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a long time Star Wars franchise fan and pretty into the \\\"geek\\\" culture\\, and I thought that this movie fit into the universe perfectly. it was shot beautifully\\, there was action\\, suspense\\, over-arching plot reveals\\, and humor. It does run a little long and there's a few scenes worth an eye roll\\, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. And its waaaaaaaaay better than any of the prequels so I think the haters should should keep in mind that it could be so\\, so much worse.","true":true}
