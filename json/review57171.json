Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is ridiculous\\, I can't believe the hate on this movie by fans. It was beautifully made with amazing performances by all the main characters. There were no more plot holes than The Force Awakens\\, but unlike TFA\\, this wasn't a remake and actually introduced some amazing ideas\\, broke new ground\\, and challenged the main characters. \\n\\nSpoiler warning! Who cares about Snoke\\, everyone hating because of the lack of backstory - go rewatch the original trilogy\\, there is exactly 0% backstory on the Emperor\\, heck the name \\\"Palpatine\\\" isn't even mentioned\\, not even once! Get over it\\, it was great to see a Star Wars movie made in the vein of the OT without getting bogged down in backstory and politics. Besides a couple of unnecessary comedy moments\\, this was a much more faithful Star Wars movie than TFA or Rogue One. Also\\, if you're upset at Rey's parentage\\, you're missing the entire message of this movie and the story that began in TFA. It's beautiful that anyone can be special without having to rely on the bloodline of their parents.","true":true}
