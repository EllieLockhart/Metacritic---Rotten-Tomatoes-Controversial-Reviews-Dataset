Well let them hate. They are blindly giving negative comment on this game. Yes this game is the most polarizing game but it didn't sucked. Gameplay is superb and the graphics are amazing as well. After completing the game I felt empty like there's a question in my head \\\"was the story great or was it a disappointment\\\"? I am feeling like this wasn't a good story nor a bad story but it was tragic not the way people wanted. It was emotional. Some are just blindly judging the game based on the leaks and some just don't care about anything. I saw the leaks and the full experience was worth. Joel's death was really tragic and sad but I still enjoyed the game. All these negative comments are just not justifiable. Most of the negative reviews are from those who didn't even played the game yet review bombing it. I don't know what else to say it's just I'm feeling empty. This game will be on my mind for a long time. I hope naughty dog makes a 3rd part or even a 4th part which will be a proper conclusion to this wonderful franchise. I will gladly play these games. Please naughty dog ignore the hate you guys are amazing and you know that. You have shown your qualities before and you will show it again. And lastly only one thing I would say is that it's a divisive game and haters will try to troll the ones who loved the game and the people who loved the game will surely defend it. This a part of the cycle of life.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
