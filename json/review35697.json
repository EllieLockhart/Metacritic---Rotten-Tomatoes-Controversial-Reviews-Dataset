Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a technical and visual marvel and is everything you've come to expect from this new generation of Star Wars films.  But the film's strength is how it builds on The Force Awaken's strong point\\, which are its interesting and lovable characters.  Watching The Last Jedi you get to know those characters that you were already deeply invested in over the last two years a bit more\\, and watch their growth right before your eyes.  Director Rian Johnson takes massive risks with the characters\\, the majority of which pay off.  BB-8 stole the show as he did last time\\, but Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, and Kylo are also strong.  And Mark Hamill gives what might be his best version of Luke Skywalker that he has ever done.  There were a few parts in the middle of the film where it seemed to tread water\\, but the thrilling finale made up for any slow parts","true":true}
