Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant\\, a very different Star Wars movie but offers some great story line and twists and turns. Definitely worth the wait and can't wait for episode 9!","true":true}
