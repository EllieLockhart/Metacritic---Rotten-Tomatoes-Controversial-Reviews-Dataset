Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My family and I all loved this movie. It had lots of \\\"wow\\\" moments. Lots of unexpected twists and did not disappoint. As soon as we left the theater\\, my 10 year old daughter said she loved it and couldn't wait to see it again!","true":true}
