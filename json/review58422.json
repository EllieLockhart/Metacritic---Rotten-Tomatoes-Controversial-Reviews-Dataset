Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good action movie\\, a terrible Star Wars movie. A slap in the face of anybody who cares about continuity. A few exemples(SPOILER):\\n\\n\\n\\nFinn doesn't know how to fly a ship in Ep.7\\, but now he knows\\, even if he's been in coma all the time.\\n\\nThe Mon Calamari ship is protected by shields. but it is not when they hit the deck.\\n\\nNo one gets sucked out when they open the door to bring back in Leia.\\n\\nLuke wanted to kill Ben because he feared the dark side in him. Is this the same Luke who saw the light in HIS FATHER?! And redeemed his father in the end. And now he thinks he can't keep in the light his teen nephew?! That's not Luke. No way.\\n\\nI left the cinema furious\\, because it felt like the director thought I was an idiot.","true":true}
