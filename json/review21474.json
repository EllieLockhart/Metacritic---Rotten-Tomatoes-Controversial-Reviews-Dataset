Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would have loved to have read the internet's reaction if it had been around when The Empire Strikes Back was first released. The bad guys win! Luke Skywalker loses his hand! Han Solo is turned to stone! Luke's new teacher is a muppet?! Darth Vader is Luke's DAD?! What the F&@^?!\\\" The latest installment of Star Wars has outraged some people\\, but what else is new? I take their dashed expectations with a grain of salt.","true":true}
