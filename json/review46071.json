Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"visually stunning film but the plot was terrible. Actually got bored half way through and leia doing her mary poppins impression is just terrible.\\nThey could of done so much more with the characters but chose not too. \\nive been left so disappointed\\, its just a mash up of empire and return of the jedi for the most of it and its just an utter let down\\,this is coming from a massive fan.","true":true}
