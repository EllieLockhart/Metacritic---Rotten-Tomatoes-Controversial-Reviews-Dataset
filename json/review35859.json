{"101487":175475,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE LAST JEDI IS TERRIBLE!\\n\\n1.\/ So Luke can survive gun fire from \\\"multiple\\\" ATAT's (simultaneously)\\, but not survive being hit with a lightsaber?\\n\\n2.\/ Ray is definitely a Mary sue. Still no explanation as to why Rey is naturally so powerful with the force. Not good enough. Rey was already way too powerful in Ep 7\\, but I was trying to withhold judgement and give them the benefit this Would all be explained in The Last Jedi\\, no such luck\\, What an absolute joke!\\n\\n3.\/ The explanation of Rays parents is a let down. So much suspense and mystery was built up in Ep 7 about who are Rays parents are\\, and this is simply explained away in The Last Jedi by Kylo Ren saying \\\"your parents are knowone\\\".\\n\\n4.\/ I was hoping Rays vision\/dream sequence from Ep 7 regarding the Knights Of Ren would be explained in The Last Jedi\\, instead it wasn't even brought up at all. That makes the Knights Of Ren scene from the previous movie (Ep 7) completely unnecessary\\, as well as confusing and out of place. The Knights Of Ren don't even make an appearance in The Last Jedi at all.\\n\\n5.\/ No explanation of how Maz got Luke's lightsaber\\, when asked in Ep 7 how she obtains Lukes lightsaber she replies \\\"a good questions for another time\\\"\\, it felt like poor\/lazy storytelling to me\\, but I thought they might mention this in the last Jedi\\, no such luck. They couldn't think of a reason so they never had the creativity to explain it. Not good enough. Technically though this is an issue with Ep 7.\\n\\n6.\/ Never found out where Snoke came from. I can accept this because we didn't know who the emperor was at the time ROTJ was released either\\, but regardless Snoke's identity still remains another \\\"unanswered\\\" question (amongst many).\\n\\n7.\/ Yoda destroys the ancient Jedi books with lightening\\, so what's the point of even having those books be in the movie in the first place?\\n\\n8.\/ Does Kathleen Kennedy hate men? The whole movie feels like a gigantic feminist convention. Lets break it down; Leia shoots a man with a gun\\, the woman with the purple hair shoots another man with a gun\\, Leia slaps Poe in the face (hard)\\, woman with purple hair berates Poe\\, Ray has a battle with Luke (the most powerful Jedi ever) and wins and then stands over him\\, female character (Roses friend\/sister) at start of movie is heroic suicide bomber\\, Rose Ticko heroically gives her life to save Finn. Oh yeah and Rey tells Kylo to put his shirt back on lol.\\n\\nIf these new females characters had substance that would be a different matter\\, BUT THEY DON'T. It's just so over the top and also meaningless. For those who are interested in well thought out and powerful female characters with substance\\, go and check out \\\"Terminator 2\\\" and \\\"Aliens\\\". Great films with great female characters. The previous film (the force awakens) was BAD and left too many questions unanswered. Even though I was MAJORLY let down by that film\\, I still thought The Last Jedi was going to be really good and pick up the pieces\\, boy was I WRONG.\\n\\nIt's nothing to do with \\\"new fans\\\" or \\\"old fans\\\"\\, the new star wars movies just don't make any sense regardless. At least the prequel films fitted together well and had a reasonable amount of cohesion. The Last Jedi is a terrible film and is an absolute letdown. I am SO disappointed with The Last Jedi.\\n\\nWay to go Rian and Kathleen\\, you have just ruined star wars.","true":true}
