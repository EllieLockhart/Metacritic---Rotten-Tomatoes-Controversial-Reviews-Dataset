Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had no connection to what the Force Awakens had setup. It was like Rian Johnson didn't follow or care use TFA as a guideline.  It was like a separate stand alone movie with characters from the previou movie before. \\n\\nI can tell that there were people that was paid to give this movie a good review which is pretty obvious and sad at the same time. \\n\\n\\nI thought I would never say that I'm not looking forward to another Star Wars Movie.  JJ Abrams...You truly have your hands full to make this trilogy make sense.  Kathleen Kennedy does not want to follow the essence of what George Lucas created.  This series is pretty much doomed.  No justice to Luke Sykwalker's character.  The only good thing about this movie was when Yoda showed up. Thank you Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for defining the old saying \\\"From Sugar to Shit\\\" with this franchise current state.","true":true}
