Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first star wars film I've ever been disappointed with. I feel they got this one so wrong that it's killed this trilogy. Boom\\, gone. Two years waiting down the drain. Rian Johnson 'must' keep away from Star wars.","true":true}
