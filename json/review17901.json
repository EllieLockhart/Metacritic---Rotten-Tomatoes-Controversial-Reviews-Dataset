Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has problems\\, but\\, as a big fan of the series\\, it's impossible to not get emocional while watching this episode. This new step of the saga is courageous and\\, some times\\, mind-blowing\\, but it can also be a little bit disappointing considering that some options made by Ryan Johnson could have been better.","true":true}
