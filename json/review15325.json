Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll defined characters muddle their way through a logic-free plot\\, portrayed in incomprehensible visuals. Yes\\, the movie even fails visually. For example\\, a shot near the beginning shows Poe and his X-Wing taking up more space in frame than the Super Mega Ultra Star Destroyer he is opposing\\, while the movie itself is attempting to portray him as David to the bad guys' Goliath.","true":true}
