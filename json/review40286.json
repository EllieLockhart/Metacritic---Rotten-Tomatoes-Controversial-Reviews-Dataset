Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn\u2019t the Star Wars movie I wanted. But it was the Star Wars movie I needed. I wasn\u2019t ready for it and had to see it a second time to embrace it (and the fate of my boyhood hero). Upon multiple viewings\\, I think this film is brilliantly polarizing and deep. It\u2019s about time Star Wars took some huge chances. Well done. Well done. ","true":true}
