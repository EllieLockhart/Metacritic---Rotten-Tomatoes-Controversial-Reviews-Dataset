Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too much comedy in a star wars movie\\, not to mention most of it being way over the top and not subtle. some comedy in a serious movie is great but not this much\\, it's jar jar all over again but worse!!
