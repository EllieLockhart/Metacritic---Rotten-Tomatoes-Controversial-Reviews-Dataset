Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels as if Rian Johnson has forgotten that the Star Wars films are a trilogy\\, not a two film thing. The plot was rapidly paced and jumped parts quicker than a bad action movie\\, with parts from TFA that don't seem to add up.","true":true}
