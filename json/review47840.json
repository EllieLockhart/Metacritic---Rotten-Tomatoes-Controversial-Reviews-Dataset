Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? This movie made me feel like I was Jar Jar Binked. What Rian Johnson made was a Star Wars parody\\, that was no where near as good (or funny) as Space Balls. While the acting was superb\\, this mess of a story was unnecessarily silly at points\\, and super space flying Leia looked ridiculous. The casino planet scenes were stolen from the prequels\\, and made to look even more like a cartoon. And (spoiler alert) Luke dies because...I don't know\\, maybe he had a broken heart like Padm\u00e9 that this movie was so bad. Hopefully in episode 9 we'll discover the whole thing was a bad dream.","true":true}
