Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A genuine disappointment... departing from a star wars where humor and plot flowed to shoe horned  jarring humor that takes away from the scene\\, it's a watered down variant of what we wanted and betrays the very films that lead to it. No one will claim the prequels are the worst anymore.... the practical effects are there the acting is even done fairly well it just seems like a combination of poor writing and a urge to wipe away the past movies so Disney can have more room to spread at best Mediocraty across the star wars universe","true":true}
