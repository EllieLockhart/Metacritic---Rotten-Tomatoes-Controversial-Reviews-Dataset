Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sensacional!!! Os defeitos na hist\u00f3ria ser\u00e3o corrigidos ou confirmados no pr\u00f3ximo filme. At\u00e9 l\u00e1 n\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra saber nada. Choramos\\, torcemos\\, vibramos! Filme excelente!","true":false}
