I am a big fan of the first TLOU and for me this was the biggest game I was waiting for. Sadly the only good thing this game had has been ruined.... yes many talk about it\u2019s amazing visuals and graphics\\, but if you are one of those persons that only plays a game from its graphics then that leave a lot to tell about your simplistic mind to be entertained. Yes\\, the game looks nice\\, but honestly is not a big deal for this time when many games look as good or BETTER than TLOU2. Gameplay wise\\, is a joke. It is still very linear\\, it strives to recreate an open world feeling but honestly sort of fails to it. It\u2019s mechanics are quiet similar from the first. Side of adding a dodge button and a jump button that is as useless as milking a bull. AI feels kind of the same\\, but again is not a big deal compare to nowadays other games. The only thing that made the first game appealing was its story\\, yes perhaps back then also its gameplay was interesting but by now is not.. and if u ruin the story then the game is sadly not as good as it used to. Now why the story bad? First\\, is not because of the all new LGBT content cuz then again it is being added everywhere and that doesn\u2019t really makes the game bad. What does makes it bad is\\, all its plot holes\\, characters that never connect with you\\, boring characters\\, the sad pathetic dead of one of the most beloved characters from the first series\\, the constant weird change of behavior from some of the characters\\, and the worst thing! Being forced to play with the one character every single player hates the most! He killer! For 10 BLOODY HOURS! This is just a joke. His game is not as good as we all expected it to be....
