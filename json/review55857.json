Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pure drivel.  Great visuals.  A screenplay written by someone that does not understand Star Wars. The film throws away all the set ups from the previous film\\, The Force Awakens.  Adds in space battle effects and strategy that make no sense tactically\\, bombs dropping in space for one\\, or breaks Star Wars\\, ships running out of gas\\, and hyperspace kamikaze rams. On top of it all\\, there is HORRIBLE comedy that does not fit in the film and quite often breaks the mood of the scene.  Completely destroys Luke Skywalker\\, making him a space cow molester\\, and \\\"Get off my lawn\\\" hermit.  The new characters from TFA have NO character growth\\, and Rey is cemented as \\\"MarySue\\\" in this film.  Not to mention the Force Skyping in the film\\, which was as stupid as can be.  On top of all the plot holes\\, there is a subplot that should have been edited out of the movie\\, to make the movie under 2 hours\\, because it went no where and wasted a half hour of your time.  The BEST part of the movie is when Luke comes back to fight at the end\\, doing Matrix style fight moves\\, until you find out he's just a force hologram projection\\, and it's not really Luke\\, so you get let down once again by the movie.  On top of it\\, Luke fades out at the end\\, for no reason other than the Director wanted to kill him off\\, so his character assassination of Luke can not be redeemed in a future film.  I left out the awkward Leia Poppins scene flying through space without a suit\\, one of the most cringe worthy moments ever seen in a big budget movie.  So basically\\, in the end\\, the Resistance\/Rebels (They can't make up their mind in the movie\\, as to who they are) are down to about 12 people and all fit in the Falcon for escape.  You leave the movie not caring about any of them\\, and could not care less who rules the Star Wars universe any longer\\, because both the First Order and Resistance were ran by the stupidest people ever\\, without any military logistical thinking\\, and no critical thinking skills.  It's like watching the Wile E. Coyote fighting against Wile E. Coyote\\, and you're the Roadrunner watching from the sidelines.  Horrible movie with great visuals.  Sharknado is a much more enjoyable and entertaining movie.","true":true}
