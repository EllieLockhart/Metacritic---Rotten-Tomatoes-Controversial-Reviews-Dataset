Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a shit-show. Complete propaganda\\, worst than the prequels. And one scene in particular was just... revolting - someone screamed \\\"What The F*ck?\\\" during it. The story is as half-assed as a fanfiction. Half of the movie was completely useless except for saying \\\"oh look at this one character\\, she has a huge sad story oh no she was a slave\\\" but she is an unlikable character so nobody really cared. They should have never made a new trilogy.","true":true}
