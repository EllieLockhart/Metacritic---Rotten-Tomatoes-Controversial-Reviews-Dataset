Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" this afternoon. I have mixed emotions. It wasn't my favorite\\, nor was it the worst IMO. Adam Driver was superb as were Mark Hamill (albeit short scenes)\\, Daisy Ridley\\, John Boyega\\, Carrie Fisher\\, and Oscar Isaac. Benicio del Toro\\, however\\, ...not so much! The same could be said about Laura Dern. Her character was totally unneeded and added very little. Her acting was also too blah! Del Toro reminds me of a Latino Samuel L. Jackson--one character in every movie. Blah x 2! My other complaints include the \\\"m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\\\" romance involving Rey\\, Finn\\, and Rose. It was too contrived and unnecessary. Likewise\\, there was a giant question mark that involved how Rey suddenly appears in the gunnery inside the Millennial Falcon shooting up the bad guys??? My last gripe deals with the length of the film. IT WAS TOO LONG! My buttocks and back were aching by film's end. Had the romance scenes been left on the editor's floor\\, it might have made the length better. So\\, out of a 10\\, I'd give it an 8. I liked Rogue One better.","true":true}
