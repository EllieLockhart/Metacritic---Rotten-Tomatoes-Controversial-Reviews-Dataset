Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed the franchise in every possible way!! They really screwed it up!!I was not very happy with the direction of TFA but I thought it was still a decent movie. TLJ has too many things that don't work. The humour is way off and lame. The leia scene in space is absurd. But the thing that really ended for me is the decision to kill off Luke. For me Star Wars is finished. There is no vision. The story for the 3 movies should have been mapped out from the outset. Lots of people criticized George Lucas but at least his movies had scope\\, great visuals and a fantastic imagination. Star Wars is gone!!!","true":true}
