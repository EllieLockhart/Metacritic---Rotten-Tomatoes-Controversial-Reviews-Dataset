Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great visuals as expected but terrible mixed up story side plots not needed and 9year old comedy puns thrown at times felt like i was watching a disney movie not a lucas movie not the worst star wars but close to the bottom","true":true}
