Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie left so many questions unanswered. It focuses way too much on the side characters and doesn't develop Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo Ren\\, or Snoke's characters. They made it seem like Luke was going to have a big part in this movie and he never even leaves the island and then vanishes to die. And who was Snoke? Why did he have so much power and why was his head all bashed in? Guess we will never know. Such a waste of potential. This movie also focuses on being humorous. It was very reminiscent of a Marvel movie and not a Star Wars movie. So much was wrong and weird about this movie. Such a disappointment.","true":true}
