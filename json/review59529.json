I don't need to say anything else.\r\rDon't make a game about vengeance and violence if you're going to skip the part trauma part. In interviews that surfaced after the release of the game Neil mentioned removing some scenes that explored Ellie's PTSD because \\\"it didn't fit into the flow of the game\\\" and that's honestly idiotic. The game has 28h+\\, it's split in two halves and it has lots of flashbacks. There was enough time to do character development right. If you think showing trauma ruins the rhythm of your game then you shouldn't tell these kinds of stories @Neil.\r\rNot exploring Ellie's trauma and doubts better made this a very tone deaf game. So she's fine murdering dozens of people who have nothing to do with her quest for revenge and only struggles with the ones that do? This should've been explored way better. There were some entries in her journal that somewhat tapped into that\\, but not near enough. This is honestly something that should've been \\\"show not tell\\\".\r\rAnyways\\, even with all those problems it's still fun to play and that's honestly what I look for in games. I've played and enjoyed games that have worse stories.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
