Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor story line\\, random under developed characters made this movie hard to like. Only thing that saved it was the visual effects. The director needs to thank their effects team cause that's the only reason this got even 2 stars from me.","true":true}
