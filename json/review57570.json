Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars film I have ever seen in my entire life. It sucked so bad that it left a bad taste in my mouth . There are no twists at all and stay away from this film no wonder why Mark Hamil was pissed. There is an actual scene were Luke is masturbating a cow alien in front of rey and the alien cow nods its head at rey while getting masterbated I wish I was lying about this shit but no its a real scene. and reys parents were just drug addicts who left her on jukka becuase they wanted more drugs and rey is a nobody and I dont get how she is so powerful in the force without explation at all. And the finn and rose sub plot was a waste of time and finn was about to go all rougue one and save everyone but no rose prevents Finn from being a major bad ass and rose gives finn the most forced kiss ever. And for the ending it was chessy as fuck. I enjoy 1-7 and rougue one but this movie sucked like the rooomate and it was very dispointing very much so. Do not see this movie it sucks so bad. Snoke was such a wasted agonist seriously. And when there is supoosed to be intense moments there are jokes. When I finshed watching the movie I was like WTF did I just watch.","true":true}
