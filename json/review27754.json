Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People want to either hate or love it\\, but the truth is that the movie is on par\\, average\\, and acceptable. There is not a singular greatest criticism or a singular greatest praise: they tried a few new things\\, while definitely rehearsing old story. It will be tempting to polarize your opinion\\, but I think this is a good opportunity to accept a movie that just runs in the middle of expectations. It is by NO means worst than prequels\\, but it is also not the best Star Wars movie.","true":true}
