Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never even remotely entertained the idea I would ever leave a bad review for a Star Wars movie in my lifetime\\, but here I am and here it is.\\n  \\n I have only one fervent hope for this review that someone\\, anyone from Disney reads this and\\, optimistic fool that I am\\, realises that what they have done with this film is wrong\\, not just a point of view\\, not just another plebs opinion\\, but  outright\\, egregiously wrong. \\n\\n  If anyone reading thinks that I'm a bot or whatever technological scape goat all these bad customer reviews have been blamed on\\, then just stop reading because you're probably the kind of brainwashed\\, trend sucking\\, dilettante who swallowed this \\\"entertainment\\\" in the first place.\\n\\n  You may notice I used the word customer above\\, might sound strange\\, but that's what I was\\, Disney's customer\\, quite happy with my purchase of The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, never expecting when I paid my \u00a319.95 back in December what I was buying at that IMAX showing. My purchase consisted quite truthfully of one of the most dispiriting\\, nihilistic and frankly upsetting experiences I have ever had in the cinema.\\n\\n  I was on your side Disney\\, I was with you\\, I enjoyed the previous two films and was looking forward to this one\\, but you've lost me\\, you spent two and half hours going out of your way to tell me you don't want my enthusiasm for this property anymore and presumably\\, you definitely don't want my money either?\\n\\n   I don't like having strong political points of view thrust upon me\\, be they right or left wing\\, when simply trying to enjoy a piece of escapist entertainment\\, lets be adults here\\, this film was pushing a very obvious agenda and it was overkill and it's ruined the movie\\, end of. There's no arguing it didn't\\, there's no other point of view here\\, it destroyed it\\, it's inarguably pissed off the fan base and if numbers are to be believed it's not done much for the films takings. It's lecturing was obvious\\, unwelcome and amateurishly misjudged. The irony is\\, I personally agree with some of the \\\"issues\\\" that were alluded to\\, but when it's so lazily inserted into the piece as it was here\\, to the point that I felt like I was being spoken to like a special needs child\\, it just serves to get peoples backs up. I'm frankly astonished this would need explaining to anyone who's been in the entertaining people business as long as Disney. \\n\\n  I could type all night and not come remotely close to describing my utter dismay at the contemptuous treatment of the character Luke Skywalker. Dear God\\, where to even begin\\, three films\\, three BLOODY films\\, to train\\, to sacrifice\\, to risk all\\, to become a Jedi\\, to redeem the unredeemable\\, to topple an evil dictatorship\\, to restore peace and justice to an entire galaxy. Then when confronted with a possible repeat of his fathers flaws in his nephew\\, I\\, as a grown reasonably intelligent adult\\, am supposed to accept that individual\\, who suffered and matured through so much\\, would posit the plan\\, \\\"right\\, I'll sneak in when he's asleep and lop his head off and blame it on the Vikings\\\"!\\n\\n  I don't need to say anymore do I\\, because any living human being with any cognitive ability would read that and think\\, no\\, that just doesn't work\\, it just doesn't. But why would they do this\\, why would Luke be cast in this light\\, because his character as it always had been\\, is not considered a palatable character by the modern zeitgeist\\, just as Han was cast as the dead beat dad in the previous episode\\, Luke is viewed as too good\\, too perfect\\, too virtuous and therefore at odds with the\\, \\\"y'know\\, the original trilogy really isn't that good kids\\\" agenda that these films are clearly pursuing.  Yet the ultimate irony is that the character of Rey is all these things and more\\, such a CHRONIC Mary Sue is she\\, that with the\\, at best\\, marginal threat the new Empire seem to pose to her\\, she already has them hog tied and branded and has moved on to reasoning the meaning of life and explaining to God where he's slipped up in the past as well. \\n\\n  When you have no confidence or true conviction in your capacity to produce an entertainment of equal or superior quality to the ones that preceded it\\, you don't try to undermine what went before. You don't try to devalue what was achieved in the story in those previous entries\\, you don't bring back beloved actors in their most iconic roles just to dispatch them with such implied disdain that it actually makes me physically wince to contemplate it. \\n\\nUNLESS\\, unless\\, your intent is to purposely alienate admirers of the original films and if that is the case\\, then well done Lucasfilm\/ Disney\\, you have won\\, you made a perfect movie to  achieve those ends. No more support\\, no more money\\, no more interest shall I ever squander on your output\\, I swear\\, as my fingers type this\\, we are done. For every beloved memory of viewing the original trilogy\\, for every behind the scenes Christmas special\\, for every dodgy Atari 2600 game I played\\, for every warm memory of endless dramas played out with 3 3\/4 inch figures\\, for every cherished\\, golden\\, life affirming experience REAL Star Wars has ever bestowed upon my life\\,  I REJECT you and your PC lectures\\, your inappropriate humour\\, your character assassination\\, I shun you\\, I consign you to the wasteland of modern popular cinema\\, to wither and die in the neglect of younger\\, more fickle generations\\, you deserve them and they deserve you.\\n\\n  Goodbye Star Wars\\, go forth and multiply Disney.","true":true}
