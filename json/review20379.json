Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It would take too long to go over everything this movie did wrong\\, so I'm going to go over what it did right.  Almost nothing.  Perhaps little kids\\, people who think \\\"love unites everyone\\,\\\" and people focused on how \\\"unequal\\\" society is will like it\\, but anyone who desires a good star wars movie\\, or just a star wars movie\\, is going to be deeply disappointed.
