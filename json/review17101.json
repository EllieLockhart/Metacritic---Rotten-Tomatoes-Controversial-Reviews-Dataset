Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie\\, and I'm surprised that fans are rating it so low. It was well done\\, and it surprised me over and over. Great plot\\, great acting; it was exciting. Better than I expected (after seeing the reactions of other fans.)","true":true}
