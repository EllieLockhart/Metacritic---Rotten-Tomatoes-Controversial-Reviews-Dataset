Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much of this movie doesn't make sense\\, ranging characters' motivations to what people can actually do with the Force. It has a few really good shots of cinematography\\, and Adam Driver's acting was spot on. Most of the rest was problematic. There were 3-4 times I thought\\, \\\"That was cool\\\"\\, but there were a good two dozen times I thought\\, \\\"That was stupid\\\". It's too long\\, and there's too much talking without people saying anything. Sorry guys\\, the movie's just not good.\\n\\nHonestly\\, this one was right on the border for me between a 2\/5 and 3\/5. There was just too much that was downright stupid in it. There were three separate times during the movie when I took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes\\, shaking my head because the movie just made no sense.","true":true}
