Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't express how disappointed I am with this movie. It achieves or answers absolutely nothing. Nothing completely makes full sense. If the point was to start something completely new\\, why destroy our beloved original characters? Those new characters with the exception of Poe are pointless and useless. Phasma the better looking one goes to waste again! Besides a couple action scenes I couldn't find anything else enjoyable or interesting about this movie. I must say I'm a hardcore fan and had high hopes and expectations for this movie. Once again extremely disappointed. Maybe the generations will find this entertaining\\, not me.","true":true}
