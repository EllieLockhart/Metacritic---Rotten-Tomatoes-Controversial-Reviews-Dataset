Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some fans didn't like like this film because it took risks and brought this new trilogy into uncharted waters for a Star Wars film. When TFA came out\\, there were cries of \\\"it's just a carbon copy of ANH; we want something new and fresh!\\\" Now\\, this one comes along and delivers that on and people are complaining that \\\"it didn't honor the OT! Muh nostalgia!!!\\\"","true":true}
