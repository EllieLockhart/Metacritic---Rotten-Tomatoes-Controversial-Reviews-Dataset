Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great visual movie\\, but plot made no sense.  Luke skywalkers legacy is destroyed in this movie.  For true fans\\, its a slap in the face.  For new fans who watched the force awakens its a slap in the face.  Nothing from the first movie is answered\\, and there are too many gotcha moments that make it seem like the director is deliberately alienating fans\\, and what jj abrams did in tfa.  I have no problem moving on to new characters\\, and breaking ties with the original trilogies\\, but that cant happen as the middle story in a new trilogy based on the originals.  At the end of episode 9\\, and then the new trilogy is the place for that.  Very disppointing overall.  I will not watch or support any further star wars movies\\, like Luke said in ROTJ\\, my movies are truly dead.","true":true}
