Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually rich with glimmers of hope cannot save what feels more like a tongue-in-cheek Marvel superhero flick\\, as opposed to a \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie. The film is too long\\, it tries way too hard and it ultimately betrays the very mythology he leans upon for levity and support. If this is the new direction Disney wants to take the \\\"Star Wars\\\" franchise\\, count me out. Maybe Luke's right: It's time for the Jedi to end.","true":true}
