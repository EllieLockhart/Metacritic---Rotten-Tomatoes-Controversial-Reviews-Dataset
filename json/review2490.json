Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Avid StarWars fan for almost (40) years. This movie confused me. Hardly any questions were answered    Like what is Snoke's story\\, what happened between Han and Leia\\, I don't believe that Rey's parents are no one. \\n\\nI don't want to ruin the movie if you haven't seen but I feel the plot was horrible. There is scene with Leia that I am pretty sure was either a Green Lantern or Mary Poppins reference. It made zero sense to me. \\n\\nThere are some really good parts to the movie so it is not all bad. I highly recommend waiting for video.  Bad Disney. Bad.","true":true}
