Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved 80 % and I haven't quit thinking about 100%. Not flawless but certainly an awesome Star Wars movie that delivers both on character development and action. Mark Hammil delivers a seminal performance.","true":true}
