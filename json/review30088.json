Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saddest addition to the series. I enjoyed the prequels and the original. Even if the prequels were a mess\\, it wouldn't have effected the Original trilogy. TLJ however completely destroys everything achieved in the previous movies and I honesty don't see how anything can be salvaged from this mess.\\nKeep politics out of movies.","true":true}
