Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Woefully lacking any ounce of Star Wars magic as if the director disliked the subject matter. Horribly disjointed lacking any real story or pace\\,scenes of absolute hilarity (Leia floating in space) and lots of unexplained holes in what story there was.If this is all disney can offer please give the franchise back to George Lucas.","true":true}
