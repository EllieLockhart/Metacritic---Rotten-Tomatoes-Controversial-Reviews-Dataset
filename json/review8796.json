Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For fans of the Star Wars series this movie will be a roller coaster ride. There are moments that will feel almost epic\\, scenes we have waited to see\\, great acting and some original idea. The problem start to come with several story elements themselves that are still seem to be taken from predecessors. The scenes that make this great are not enough to cover up what appears to be deliberate retelling of stories already made in this Saga that are canon. I have never been to a movie where it felt like it was a waste of my time or that there was such a discrepancy in characters from previous continuity.","true":true}
