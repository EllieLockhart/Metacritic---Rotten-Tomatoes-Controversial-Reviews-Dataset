Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were SO many things wrong with this film. As a major Star Wars fan\\, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I'm not going to get into everything because it would take hours\\, however\\, I will say that it was a heck of a lot worse than the phantom menace","true":true}
