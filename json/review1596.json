Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of Star Wars I was disappointed by the casual dismal of many aspects of the original trilogy and the treatment of the older characters. \\n\\nAlthough the effects were some of the best ever in a Star Wars movie these soon wear off to reveal a shallow story and illogical plot points. \\n\\nPretty bad.","true":true}
