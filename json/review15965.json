Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to leave a negative review for this piece of crap.  Why does Luke Skywalker want to kill children? If Yoda's force ghost can call down lightening why didn't he do that to palpating in Return of the Jedi?  Who is Snoke and why is he dead?  Boy\\, those guys sure stuck to the casino people riding those coyotes around.  Chewbacca's bird hampsters are so cute.  Yikes.  I might be done with the galaxy far far away.","true":true}
