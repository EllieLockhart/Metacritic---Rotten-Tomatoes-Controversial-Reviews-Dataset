Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many problems with this movie. So. Many. Problems. In fact\\, I can't even go into them. Just don't see this movie. Disney\\, DO NOT let Rian Johnson anywhere near this franchise again!","true":true}
