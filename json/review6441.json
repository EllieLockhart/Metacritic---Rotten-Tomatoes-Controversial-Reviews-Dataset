Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney took a huge dump on the Star Wars franchise. Was very excited to see it. Was hugely disappointed. Don't waste your hard earned money. If you have to see it wait to rent it at home. Don't let your friends and family see you watching it in public. Disney wiped their lame stank all over this thing. It's corny\\, stupid and politically correct. Plus now they kill off Luke. I want my 2 1\/2 hours of my life back!!! Why not kill off Mickey Mouse Disney? That seems about fair. Updated my review to 1 Star since they are not counting 1\/2 Stars. Won't be seeing any more Disney Star Wars films in the future. Thanks to The Mouse.","true":true}
