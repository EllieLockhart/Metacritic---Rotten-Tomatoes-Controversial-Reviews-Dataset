Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay. I'm not going to go into critical detail here\\, but the plot was weak\\, Rose and Flynn went on a random goose chase and stumbled upon some random guy that could sorta work. There is honesty just so much to say and I don't feel like explaining it all. It did have some cool\\, original\\, and strong points\\, but it had more (so waaay too many) cheesy (like the porgs\\, which were cute and funny the first few times\\, but then I found myself rolling my eyes at Disney using them for cheap laughs by the end) strange (Leia's replacement officer\\, who just for some reason would speak of her plan to save the rebels) and just plain awful (like how Leia-in the cave- said there was no hope.... And then que Skywalker emerging through the mist at the most perfect and cheesy time). \\nLike I said\\, I could go on and on. It's worth an initial watch because it's star wars... But worth nothing more","true":true}
