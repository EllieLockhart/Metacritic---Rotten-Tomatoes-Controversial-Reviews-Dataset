Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not understand how people can rate this positively. I was so hyped for the new movie. Yet\\, it's the first time I login somewhere to write down a review. The plot was moving at a slow pace\\, so much opportunities with new villains completely ruined. So much potential for fight scenes or importants moments and all of them ruined. I am seriously baffled by how this movie came to theater. I waited 2 years for this movie after a very good Force Awakened. It was a copie of A New Hope but it still was extremely good. This one? It went down the wrong way by making villain(s) go streamline without any flavor. Some cringy scenes where humor wasn't needed (A lot of it was good though). The visuals were amazing\\, I have to give it that. To be frank\\, I've never been this dissapointed in a hyped movie such as this one.","true":true}
