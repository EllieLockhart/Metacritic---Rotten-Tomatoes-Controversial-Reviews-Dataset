Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal movie! Confused as to why people are comparing it to empire and calling it a \\\"rip off\\\" they're two completely different movies!  The camera work in this movie is down right beautiful! The acting is top notch from everyone. All story aspects are great ( although I do wish we saw less of that Finn side quest thing\\, or at least they could have made it a little more interesting.) Do not let anyone spoil this one for you. If you're a Star Wars fan go and see if\\, you'll be genuinely surprised in the direction this movie takes. Expect the unexpected! When the action hits\\, its some of the best we've seen in a Star Wars movie to date. I won't spoil any of it\\, but it really is glorious. This movie feels like a finale\\, and I'm excited to see how they are able to continue this into episode 9.","true":true}
