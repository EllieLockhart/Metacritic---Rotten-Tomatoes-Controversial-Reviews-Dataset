Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was probably something I would go see once at the theater and then never watch again. They tried way to hard to add comedic moments when the movie was to serious\\, some of the story line did not make sense and was very vague\\, and overall this movie just wasn't the greatest.","true":true}
