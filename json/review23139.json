Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED IT. Completely delivered. Been a fan since the first Star Wars A New Hope (IV) came out in 1977 and were followed by The Empire Strikes Back (V) and Return of the Jedi (VI). Episodes I\\, II\\, and III were a disappointment BUT let\u2019s not go there. This last installment is awesome. It weaves both past with new elements and characters truly honoring beloved characters while making it fresh and exciting and new. The worlds\\, scenes\\, fights\\, plot twists\\, dialogue and\\, best of all\\, the characters really made this one great. It made me laugh\\, it made me cry and made me want more!","true":true}
