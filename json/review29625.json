Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson should be relegated to an eternity of working sound crew on a dungeon porn movie set as punishment for making this god awful film.  I'm still trying to figure out how he managed to screw up this badly when he had 1) the bottomless pockets of Disney\\, 2) literal DECADES of Star Wars lore to draw from as inspiration (not copy\\, but draw from...see Rogue One as an example of how to be unique\\, amazing\\, and still true to SW at the same time)\\, and 3) the super solid base\/blank canvas J.J. Abrams left him in the form of TFA.  I could go on and on about how this movie clearly cared more about pushing a progressive social agenda than actually telling a good story\\, but I think all people really need to know in deciding whether to see this movie is that even Mark Hamill (that's f^$#ing Luke Skywalker himself) has publicly disparaged this movie.","true":true}
