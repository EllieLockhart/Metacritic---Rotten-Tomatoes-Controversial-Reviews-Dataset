Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never left a theater feeling this upset. Rian Johnson along with his puppeteers at Disney have successfully sold out the most beloved film franchise of all time for some cheap laughs and shallow\\, meaningless characters. From yet another painfully blatant mimicry of the cantina sequence from the original trilogy\\, to ridiculous and unsatisfying answers to mysterious plot points generated from The Force Awakens\\, this movie is nothing short of infuriating. Not only does The Last Jedi give us a collection of annoying and unnecessary characters\\, but it also manages to effectively ruin characters from the original trilogy we already know and love. Perhaps the most frustrating part of all is the movie's inability to have even a moment of seriousness without being broken up by a \\\"witty\\\" one-liner that ruins the entire scene. This might as well have been an avengers movie. From start to finish\\, this movie is overly ambitious\\, nonsensical\\, and irritating. I have no idea how we could have gone from the masterpiece that was Rogue One to this steaming hunk of cinematic garbage. I'm scared for what is to come after this sad attempt.\\n\\nCongratulations Rian Johnson\\, you ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
