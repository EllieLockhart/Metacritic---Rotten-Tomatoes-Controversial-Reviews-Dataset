Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie and everything about it. Felt bad for the actors that were in it\\, especially Mark Hamill and John Boyega. This is what happens when you get so cynical and deconstruct everything: there is nothing positive left to root for. \\n\\nThat said\\, I have so much invested in my decades of Star Wars fandom that I will see Rise of Skywalker anyway. Yes\\, it helps that Rian Johnson isn't involved.","true":true}
