Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi seemed okay as I was watching it\\, but as I left the theater and digested what I had just seen\\, the glaring plot holes and betrayals\/undoing of previous character progression and story arcs actually started to make me a little angry with it. Now I'm just disappointed at all it could have been but failed to be. Should have been way better. Not a movie I would care to see a second time. The original trilogy is something I will watch again and again and share with my kids some day. This one was just a one time viewing\\, throw away movie. I dare say that even Phantom Menace was better. As an audience member I'm insulted that Hollywood feels this kind of rubbish is good enough.","true":true}
