Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great movie actully\\, don\u2019t understand why everyone is hating on this one \u261d\ufe0f. It wasn\u2019t as good as like the revenge of the sith\\, but it had a good plot with some turns and some nice references to previous movies. I feel like this movie really ties together MOST of the questions asked about previous movies","true":true}
