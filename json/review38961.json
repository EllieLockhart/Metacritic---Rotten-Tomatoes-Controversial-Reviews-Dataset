Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They should have named it WWII WARS.\\n\\nRian Johnson\\, instead of using his time for watching the previous Star Wars movies and trying to get a glimpse of its world's inner structure\\, laws\\, lore and characters\\, passed hours or maybe days watching old WWII war documentaries. \\nIn that movies he saw some incredibly eye-catching scenes and he thought he could transpose them into a Space Opera movie.\\n\\nThat is an extremely and embrarassingly bad idea.\\n\\n1. Bombers are used to hit a ground target which\\, by definition\\, cannot move. On Earth\\, you could try bombing a slowly moving ship\\, like an aircraft carrier\\, but your bombers should be really fast. YOU DON'T BOMB A SPACESHIP which\\, at every moment\\, could (and should\\, unless its captain is a complete retard) jump into Hyperspace and evade your attack by simply moving away a few miles.\\nWhy did Moden Canady\\, captain of the Fulminatrix\\, not move the dreadnaught the exact moment he saw the bombers approaching is beyond incompetence. Leia Organa's decision to use bombers to target a spaceship is beyond incompetence. This entire movie is beyond incompetence.\\n\\n2. In WWII movies\\, the aircrafts that are hit become engulfed in flames and swerve because: a) their engines stop working\\, the speed decreases dramatically and aerodynamic lift ceases b) gravity attracts them to the ground. In space\\, a spaceship does not stop moving when the engine stops thrusting it. It continues with the same speed along the trajectory it had before the engines were stopped. It does not swerve because THERE IS NO GRAVITY IN SPACE. You can say what you want about other moments in previous Star Wars where physics is a bit different than that of our galaxy\\, but gravity in space NEVER HAPPENED in the previous 8 movies. If Rian Johnson simply took the time to watch them\\, he would have known.\\n\\n3. An officer of the Fulminatrix dreadnaught is seen using A PERISCOPE. I spotted it the third time I watched this abomination of a movie. A PERISCOPE!!! As said before\\, Rian Johnson is in love with WWII imagery and he felt compelled to insert a PERISCOPE on a spaceship. Too bad the use of this kind of device is ridiculous on a spaceship which is by no means immersed in a liquid that hides it from observers floating on the surface of that liquid. Why use such a device? Because it was so visually cool in all those WWII war documentaries!!! OK. We got it Rian\\, but here it is RIDICULOUS nonetheless. And demonstrates how stupid and arrogant you are.\\n\\n4. The use of a ground cannon\\, drawn on the surface of the Crate planet is ABSURDLY RIDICULOUS. The resistance base could (and should\\, unless all commanders of the First Order are idiots and\/or incompetents) be destroyed with a single shot from an orbiting spaceship. No need to give the enemy enough time to escape.\\n\\nRian Johnson is incompetent and arrogant. And a terribly bad writer.","true":true}
