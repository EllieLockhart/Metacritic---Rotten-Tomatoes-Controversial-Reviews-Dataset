Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How the FLYING fuck does this movie have a 91% Can we not admit that it's fucking terrible. That Luke is annoying and a quitter. That Finn didn't even need to be in the movie. The movie is BORING AF. Just like you can't call anyone crazy\\, you can't say a Star Wars movie sucks ass. I loved Episode 7 (AKA Episode 4 Remastered). But this was complete trash... Just admit it you fucks","true":true}
