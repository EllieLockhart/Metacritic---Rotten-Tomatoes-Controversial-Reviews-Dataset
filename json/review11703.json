Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can movie that failed to work within the star wars lore get 91% rating.\\nI didn't see Solo. \\nI'm a life long fan. \\nIt turned me off star wars. \\nTFA has hole and set up...as a fan I'll give a lot.\\nThis movie just made more plot holes until it was broken. \\nI have no idea how was made. \\nIt painful to think about.\\nThe only good point was it looked great. \\nNo story\\, no love from me","true":true}
