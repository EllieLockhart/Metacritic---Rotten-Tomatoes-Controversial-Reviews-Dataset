Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is decent on its own but as a part of the Star Wars trilogy it doesn't fit kylo is even more whiny in this way more than anakin in the prequels Luke became a coward who saw that his nephew had a bad dream and tried to kill him but when his father who was darth Vader who killed most of the Jedi and children he still finds the good within him.Rey is as boring as ever who doesn't understand what a Mary Sue and claims it's sexist for some reason and tries to argue that Rey isn't a Mary Sue but lists everything a Mary Sue is stupid sub plot about how CGI horse things lives matter with the worst character since jar jar binks rose she does nothing to the plot and feels like a fanfiction insert more than a actual character. The way the first order was going to beat the resistance was by waiting for them to run out of gas. The movie has some great moments but is over shadowed by the bad ones. I'm glad Rian is trying to take reviews as a way to improve and not claiming people are not smart enough or are just sexist or racist.Hopefully he improves for the trilogy he is directing.","true":true}
