Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good addition to the Star Wars story. However\\, it left several questions from the first move unanswered such as who Snoke really is\\, as well as who Ray\u2019s parents really are. Spoiler (the movie makes it seem to indicate that she is not related to any of the original characters at all. That her parents are nobodies weather this is true or just a way to confuse us and throw us off still remains unanswered.) There is a scene with Rey in it that makes absolutely no sense at all. Also what they have done to Luke\u2019s Character is both interesting and sad. As he seems to have changed A great deal from the Luke Skywalker we all know and love. The other thing that I find sad is that they seem to take delight in killing off all the original characters. However\\, the storyline is great and it is as action packed as to be expected from any Star Wars movie. Can\u2019t want to see the next installment. However\\, I am not looking forward to seeing who they kill off from the originals in the upcoming movie which I believe is to be released next year. ","true":true}
