Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead. I wish I hadn't held out and given it a chance cause I missed out on getting my refund. Whoever wrote this script should never work again. The people making the decisions for Star Wars do not understand the lore and universe. It's sad to see what has become of George Lucas' legacy. Worst of all was the treatment of Mark Hamill and his treasured character Luke Skywalker. What they did to Luke is unforgivable. I won't be watching anymore Star Wars films cause it is obvious dollars are the only way to get through to Hollywood. Shame\\, I have been a fan of Star Wars my whole life and now I could care less about it going forward.","true":true}
