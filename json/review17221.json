Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this movie\\, i saw it twice in 5 days. I loved the way the characters develop. I loved the acting. Visually it was stunning! It was made wich so much love for the original trilogy\\, you can see the director was a fan in his childhood. The only thing i really didn't like is the ending of Snoke\\, but I hope Kylo Ren will develop further in the dark side and become an even stronger bad guy! This movie takes the Star Wars saga in a new direction and clears the path for a new generation!","true":true}
