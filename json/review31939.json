Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoiler free* When it's good it's great. When it failters it does so pretty hard. Lots of twists and turns. An impressive visual treat to be sure\\, but some of the plot holes are glaring. Most of the funny parts are great\\, but some feel forced and cheesy at times. Still lots of unanswered questions and unusual decisions for characters. Overall a good edition to the Star Wars franchise. I'll be viewing it a second time tonight and we will see how it fairs for repeated viewing.","true":true}
