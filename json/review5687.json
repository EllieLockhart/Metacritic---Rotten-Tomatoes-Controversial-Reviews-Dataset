Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the movie have great special effects? Sure! Will I go watch it again\\, probably not. Now that anyone is capable of having the force\\, none of the characters mean anything to me. I\u2019ll just stick with episodes 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, and Rogue One.","true":true}
