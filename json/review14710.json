Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never see anthing like this movie before. TLj has some excellent scenes\\, but iT also has plenty of truly awful ones. There are some really great performances overshadowed by A sundry of terrible acting. Tlj offers plenty to like\\, however\\, there is far more to dislike. For me\\, the desecration of Luke Skywalker and the scene where Rose \\\"saves\\\" Finn are the two thermal detonators that obliterated this movie.","true":true}
