Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian is a great director but he really dropped the ball on this one. I was 11 when the first one came out so Star Wars has been part of my life for 40 years so I understand the formula. This movie however didn't follow any of the thematic elements that makes a SW movie and it felt really pretentious. I know Rian will probably make a great new trilogy but taking on the Skywalker saga was just too much for him.","true":true}
