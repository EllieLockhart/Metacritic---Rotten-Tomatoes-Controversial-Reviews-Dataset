Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"10-6-18\\, just learned that conservative people are not supposed to like this movie... I'm a conservative\\, I loved the movie\\, I think its great that female leads are the stars and i have a Fin action figure on my desk at the police department where I work. I stand by my original review which follows this update. This movie was awesome\\, get over it. Loved it! I think the direction the characters are going is logical and interesting. I thought the movie was amazing and I highly recommend it. I also welcomed the fact that chances with the story were taken and they paid off. Thank you Disney and Johnson for having a set and pushing forward. Thank you for not conforming to the idealized fan theories and actually bringing a new direction and some real surprises to the Galaxy\\, far far away.","true":true}
