Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me wrong\\, The Last Jedi is an enjoyable film. The problem is\\, the film feels and is in many ways a stand alone film\\, and I came to see the second instalment of a trilogy. I'm not a fan of Star Wars\\, but I enjoyed episodes V1\\, V\\, VI and VII and the episode format of the original trilogy with its three act feeling.  It flowed\\, even from VI to VII.  I am a fan of a good story.\\nAs it turns out\\, this film tries so hard to depart from the first (OK 7th) film that the force awakens becomes irrelevant. In fact\\, Episode VIII would be more enjoyable if I had not seen Episode VII.  There are so many plot holes that are so glaringly obvious that Disney has demonstrated ignorance of basic storytelling. The audience is treated largely with contempt by assuming that a fun film with great visuals can overcome character development and the plot-holes.\\nThe biggest plot-hole is Rey. Her mysterious abilities with the force are never explained.  Her lineage is dismissed as frivolous\\, and with effectively no training from Luke instantly becomes a Jedi.  Now Darth Vader needed years of training despite being the \\\"chosen one\\\" who is exceptionally (above all before him) strong in the force. Luke Needed instruction from Ben and Yoda in the basics at least.  Reys story is a letdown.\\nSnoke shows himself to be more powerful in the force than Vader or Palpatine (none of them threw their opponents around like rag dolls)\\, and then is thrown into the pit like Bobba Fett\\, as if he held little relevance.  His existence\\, the first order...none of it is explained now he is gone\\, I doubt it ever will. It appears that because we\\, the audience\\, wanted an answer\\, that Disney decided we didn't deserve one.\\nPoe in episode VII was witty\\, brave\\, loyal\\, empathetic\\, and a character we thought would replace Han Solo as a fan favourite.  Alas in episode VIII we saw a different character; reckless\\, self centred\\, lacking empathy (to the point of being almost sociopathic)\\, and worse of all\\, witless. \\nI could go on...the seeming irrelevance of Han Solo's death (a quick mention but nothing heartfelt)\\, of Dart Vader\\, and who was that Kenobi fellow again?  Why Disney decided to deliberately remove the flow and deviate as much as possible from what was setup in episode VII is beyond my understanding.  Yet they still did what we all expected and killed off another beloved character (Yes Disney...we expected it).","true":true}
