Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks for killing my Star Wars addiction. Beautifully filmed but no soul no substance. Just a bitch with plastic surgery and implants...which some people like but you toss out that Shi! Once you finish which is exactly what they should do Rian. What garbage.. go see it and you can comment here too. Fricken BS","true":true}
