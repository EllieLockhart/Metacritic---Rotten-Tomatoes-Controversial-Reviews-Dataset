Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is truly unfortunate that JJ & TROS's Box Office will take the heat for how terrible this movie was. Yeah it made \\\"big unexpected changes\\\" and was an overall good-looking film. But can we get a movie that does both of those things without ruining the trilogy\/possibly the entire saga?","true":true}
