Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"F#CKING MIND BLOWING.  I JUST GOT OUT OF THE OPENING SHOWING AND WOW IT HAS MESSED ME UP.  i HAVE TO SEE IT AGAIN TO LET EVERYTHING SET IN.  SO MUCH TO PROCESS. THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHERS STAR WARS.   YOU WILL CHEER\\, YOU WILL CRY\\, YOU WILL LAUGH AND YOU MIGHT EVEN NEED A DRINK AFTER WOOD!!! AMAZING SCRIPT\\, EFFECTS AND ACTING.  MARK HAMILL HIS BEST LUKE SKYWALKER TO DATE.  CARRIE FISHER IS GREAT (RIP).  DAISY R & ADAM D ARE PERFECT.  CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT AGAIN!!!!!\\n\\nI have now seen it for a 2nd time and it is even better the 2nd time around. watching it a 2nd time things made more sense and I was able to take in the script better with the performances.   If you did not like this movie or still letting it set in from a first showing.  GO SEE IT AGAIN AND JUST SET BACK AND ENJOY.  IT IS MUCH MUCH BETTER THE 2ND TIME AROUND!!!!!!","true":true}
