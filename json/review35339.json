Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of tme will almost surely type the complete works of Shakespeare.    Give said monkey 10 minutes and you've got yourself \\\"The last Jedi\\\".\\nThis film is so bad you can smell it.It stinks!\\nAs for people who are giving this film 5 stars\\,all I can say to you is that you must be every salespersons wet dream.","true":true}
