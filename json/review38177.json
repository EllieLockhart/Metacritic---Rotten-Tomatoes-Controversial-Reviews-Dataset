Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The trailer gave me goosebumps\\, I purchased the tickets 2 months ago. The film had loads of potential\\, but it came up short. sure\\, it was a good looking film\\, but is that hard nowadays? 3 hours\\, not a single moment moved me emotionally\\, and finn's \\\"Im not gunna run this time\\\" moment? really? Little to no character development\\, no struggle\\, no entertaining fight scene. I hate when a movie's sole purpose is to set up a sequel\\, and that's exactly what happened here. Rian Johnson\\, Disney and Co will laugh all the way to the bank while they take our collective 2 billion dollars\\, and right when I get over it\\, they will drop a teaser trailer for a star wars story. \\n\\nSpoiler summary- She moves small rocks\\, wastes 3 hours of your time\\, then moves big rocks. End scene.","true":true}
