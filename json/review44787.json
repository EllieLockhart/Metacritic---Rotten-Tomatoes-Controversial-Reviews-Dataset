Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tried way to much in one movie in my opinion. Also I thought i t just kept making up new stuff with out ever showing that could happen in the world. Overall pretty mediocre movie :(","true":true}
