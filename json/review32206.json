Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: A New Hope was the first movie I ever saw...I was three years old at the time. Star Wars: The Last Jedi has given me a New Hope in this franchise. I liked Force Awakens but it seemed to mirror a New Hope a lot and worried me that \\\"fresh\\\" ideas for the story would be hard to come by\\, but now I look forward to what is to come and I have hope in Rian Johnson that he will make fresh and welcome additions past this episode. Go see this movie and ignore the people giving it low scores. One of the best SW movies ever.","true":true}
