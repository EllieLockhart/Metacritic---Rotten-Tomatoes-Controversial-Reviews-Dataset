Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very interesting SW film in that there are some great things about it\\, and some terrible things about it.   Great:  Kylo Ren becomes a fully formed character-easily the most interesting character in the new trilogy.   Great:  The pacing.  It doesn't drag like the prequels.   Great: Production quality and soundtrack.  Par for a SW film.  Good: Mostly likable characters.  Even Rose isn't so bad\\, once you take her youth into account.   Terrible: Woke moralizing\\, delivered subtly as well as over your head with a bat.   This movie is definitely a product of its time.   The weird treatment of Poe Dameron leaves a bad taste.  Terrible:  Screwed up Luke Skywalker.  In fact\\, Rian Johnson is a bad at generating sympathy for his heroes as he is as good at developing Kylo Ren.   Terrible: \\n everything about TJ\\, an overly cynical and slimy character who doesn't fit into the Star Wars universe.  Overall\\, I think it's better than The Force Awakens and all the prequels\\, but I realize that it's not everyone's cup of tea.  ","true":true}
