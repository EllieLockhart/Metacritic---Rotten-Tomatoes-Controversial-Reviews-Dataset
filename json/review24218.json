Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. It was fine. Didn't mind they used force time\\, astral projection\\, could survive in space. But didn't care for the story\\, which they've already done in one or more other STAR WARS movies. And now the main bad guy alive (Driver) is as psychotic and easily distracted as Trump!","true":true}
