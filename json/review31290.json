Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some brilliant scenes over shadowed by the constant misuse of humor throughout the whole move. Plot lines from the previous movies were dropped. No respect the the source material. Plot involving the ship chase lacks any sense. Many plot-holes. Over all damages the story the series has built.","true":true}
