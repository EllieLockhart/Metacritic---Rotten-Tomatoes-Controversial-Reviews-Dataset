Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waste of 2.5 hours... Most boring and uneventful movie I have seen in a while. \\nIt's beyond me how this movie could possibly be \\\"certified fresh\\\"? What an absolute joke.","true":true}
