Right after the end of the game I sat in my room and I stared at my monitor for nearly an hour because the game left me empty. The story is completely different form the first game; there's no real enemy here (we're just used to see the story from Joel and Ellie's eyes)\\, just a bunch of people trying to get their own justice. The ending is like a punch in the face\\, it's so wrong and right at the same time. My final score is 8-8\\,5\/10\\, a very good game unfairly criticized but also not a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
