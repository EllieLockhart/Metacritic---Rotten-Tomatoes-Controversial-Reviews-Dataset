Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn\u2019t really like this movie when I first left the theater but I watched some reviews on YouTube explaining the ending and some key points. I instantly enjoyed it after some of it was explained. Was it the best Star Wars movie ever? No. Was it exciting\\, fun\\, and worth seeing??? Yes!!! It went against all the traditional Star Wars movies and made a new path for the Force to live on forever!!!! ","true":true}
