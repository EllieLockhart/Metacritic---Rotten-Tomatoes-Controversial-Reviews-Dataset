This game is a technical and\\, yes\\, storywise\\, a masterpiece. I didn't personally like some of the elements in the game. But that doesn't make it *objectively* bad. It's like this - mango may be my favorite ice cream flavor. So it doesn't mean all other ice cream flavors are bad. I can still enjoy very much many other ice cream flavors if the one I want isn't available.\r\rThis is a LONG game.

Let all your preconceptions and prejudices go and just let the creators tell the story they wanted to tell.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
