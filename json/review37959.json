Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The shiniest golden turd I've ever seen. The movie is like a fancy mansion trashed by teenagers while mom and dad are away. There's a great movie buried under piles of leftist\\, SJW propaganda. It feels like it was written by a 12 year old girl making fan-fiction about Star Wars\\, which she only knows by what she reads about online.  The rebellion leadership are stupid\\, the acting is stupid\\, the villans are stupid\\, the heros act stupid\\, everything that matters deeper than the pacing and visuals are made so badly that it could only come out of groupthink headed by a womans studies PHD. \\n\\nThe physics in the universe break their own lore\\, the villains are racially monotone and ugly\\, the heros are all brave and self-sacrificing. Everything is fake and a lie and it sucks. This is not star wars. This is something far\\, far worse. Do not support this crap.  Do not see this movie. Do not buy any more Star Wars anything until they fix this problem or else SJWs will come to ruin your movies and games too. Kill it here\\, kill it now.","true":true}
