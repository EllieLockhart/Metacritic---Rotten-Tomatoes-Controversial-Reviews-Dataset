Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing!  Rian Johnson used only 2 hours to completely ruin a sci-fi milestone that was build by generations of people over 4 decades.  Just amazing!\\n\\nThere is enough said about all the loopholes\\, and how it is lacking continuation from the previous story lines.  I didn't really have any problem with the directing and filming.  But like everyone else said\\, the story is just garbage.  Other than the story\\, characters are supposed to be the most intriguing part of a movie\\, and this movie delivered an \\\"F\\\" on it.  None of the characters delivered any depth for people to relate.  Mary \\\"Rey\\\" Sue is merely the problem.  Kylo Ren acts like a teenage kid and does things that often makes no sense.  Villains are one of the most important pieces and \\\"The last Jedi\\\" fails miserably IMO.  Cpt. Phasma?  She got like 2 minutes of screen time and no longer makes any difference.  Everyone had a very high hope for Snoke\\, and......okay\\, I don't even want to discuss that because it's a waste of my time.  Anyway\\, one thing is certain - I will not paid for another Disney Star Wars movie again.","true":true}
