Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film since the last Disney Star Wars film.  Old stories\\, plot points\\, and script foundations from the first film were completely disregarded.  Diversity took priority over merit of any kind.  Merit of acting.  Merit of writing.  Merit of story telling.  Even merit of minority characters.  Finn is still the embodiment of disappointment.  Why even make a black character if you're going to always treat him like garbage?  All newly added characters were horrible.  Just a really\\, really bad movie all around.","true":true}
