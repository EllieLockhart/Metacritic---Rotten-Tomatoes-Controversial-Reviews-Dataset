Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everybody knows that the dice are loaded\\, Everybody knows the good guys lost... Ohh Leonard.  This pretentious millennial edition version of Star Wars riddled with social agenda themes\\, bad cringe-worthy jokes and utter disregard for George Lucas' creation can only be loved by those void of cinematic history.   We go to the movies for escapism\\, a distraction from realties\\, political agendas and divisiveness.   If Rian Johnson & Disney wanted to inspire dreams\\, then they failed miserably with this hack of a storyline.    Similar to how the Oscars are loosing viewership\\, so is Hollywood in general.  A shadow of its former \\\"dream factory\\\" status.  Full of political agendas and correctness.   \\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away....\\\" they \\\"phone calls\\\" and \\\"fuel issues\\\".   If you enjoy rolling your eyes every 5 mins\\, go see this twat of a movie.    Way to go Disney\\, you've ruined my childhood dreams.","true":true}
