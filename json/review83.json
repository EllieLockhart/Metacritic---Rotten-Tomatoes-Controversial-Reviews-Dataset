That said there is only really two locations and after Yakuza 5 I was expecting a larger and more diverse game.\r\rAlso to note is that the story is well directed and its ties in a lot of loose ends if you have played all the other Yakuza games so its a must play for any fan of the series.\r\rOn the combat side of things Majima is a lot more fun of the two characters and his levelling system is richer and more point to actually levelling him up and his fighting style is fun to use. Kiryu's level tree is a bit pointless at times as some of the fighting styles other than his default are boring and clunky and there is no incentive to level up them up.\r\rThe is the only bad point I have about this game and now the franchise\\, the combat is getting stale they need to start making the AI smarter and having a more skilled approach to combat\\, somewhere between a tactical fighter like Bloodborne\/dark souls with more rpg elements and what it is now would be the best thing ever for this series. There are no real consequences to fighting poorly or well\\, you just loose more health and have to use more consumables. As it stands you can almost just mash the hits buttons and pretty much win every fight without thinking. But if you like the other Yakuza games like I do its just something you live with\\, but it would be nice if they fixed this.\r\rOverall not the best Yakuza game (I think 5 was) but still a very fun game. I threw about 40 hours in to it to complete the main story\\, most side quests and the larger mini games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
