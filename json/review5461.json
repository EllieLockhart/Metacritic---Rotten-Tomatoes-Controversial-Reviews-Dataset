Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the title and money Disney has dumped into Lucas Arts\\, this is unfortunately not a Star Wars movie. It shows no love or value of any past movies\\, stepping on everything we once held close. It seems they forgot Star Wars is a shared universe\\, and there were two trilogies leading up to this movie. Characters feel out of place\\, gaining no real emotional attachment with the audience. The amount of twists will leave you motion sick. Half way through nothing will surprise you because nothing is what it seems\\, and their attampt a subverting our expectations feels like they blindfolded themselves and threw darts on a wall with a million plots.","true":true}
