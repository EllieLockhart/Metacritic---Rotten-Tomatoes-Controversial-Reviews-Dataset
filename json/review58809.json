The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let me start by saying that it's heartbreaking to see that the majority of gamers can't even try to handle a story like this.. You don't have to be a SJW to appreciate the work put into something like this piece of gaming history. Well\\, I'd like to congratulate ones among us who do a ppreciate a plot that is smarter and deeper than the newest instalment of halo's call of duty dota\\, after 7 years of waiting we have received something that only happens once in a console generation.\r\rJust a nota bene\\, I've played the game twice now on Hard and Hard+ and think that it's the level it was meant to be played at. Anything below almost feels like a non-challenge.\r\rEverything in this game can be considered an industry best - level design\\, mechanics\\, sound design\\, character development\\, lighting\\, script writing\\, animations...everything. If you have any understanding in how modern games are made\\, you will appreciate the effort the people at Naughty Dog have put into this title. The way the game unfolds\\, the way levels are structured\\, the way the lighting is used and the camera moves.. The way the sound and the music set the mood and tell the story..\r\rCompared to the first game\\, part 2 has a way smarter AI that keeps you on your toes when playing at decent difficulty levels. The mechanics\\, while still being almost the same\\, have been finessed and broadened. It's fun to go and replay the encounters by trying different approaches and tactics.\r\rBut the main reason why I decided to write this review is the whole review bombing situation which I wholeheartedly despise. This game will be a financial and cultural success\\, no doubt about it. But what makes me super confused is the fact that majority of gamers can't handle a death of a protagonist\\, sexual preferences of a few characters and the fact that FEMALES CAN GROW MUSCLE. It's 2020 and it's time to grow up and accept it. Throughout the whole game I had thoughts and emotions rushing through my head trying to answer questions. Questions of unnecessary violence\\, love\\, compassion\\, forgiveness. I wasn't simply smashing buttons and killing one NPC after another and progressing from level to level. I was persistently reflecting on what was happening on the screen. This is why I sincerely love this game.\r\rBut I guess If you can't handle this\\, please consider sticking to something simpler. Play a session of Warzone with your mates\\, let off steam. Maybe one day you'll grow up and be able to fully appreciate this game. Maybe.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
