Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ made a movie that didnt have a leg to stand on and he doesnt get a pass just because its the first film in a trilogy. He made a kids movie and now we have to live with JJs stupid name dropping crap. JJ has no idea how to end any story. How can we expect him to do the last film in the trilogy?  Rian johnsons star wars fixed everything wrong with force awakens to the point where you can just bypass force awakens. The characters were so much more likable and believable. He actually let the characters make mistakes and fail and that kept it so fresh and unpredictable. i could go on and on about how its so much better than force awakens.","true":true}
