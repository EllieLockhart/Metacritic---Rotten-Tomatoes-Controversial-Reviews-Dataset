Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are things I like about the movie: Score & Visuals.\\n\\nThere are too many disappointing things (described perfectly by other comments) to list.\\n\\nI do want to address the matter of faux-sexism and faux-racism. Sexism and RAcism are real issues in the world that I and other women like me have to deal with. insisting negative feedback about this movie is as a result of those real world issues is extremely insulting and frustrating.\\n\\nYou want to have a good movie? write good material. i want to see men and women i can relate to and can buy into when i watch a movie. This is not what TLJ delivered. Instead we got half-baked plots and under-developed characters. I also felt there was an extreme screw you to people who read the books\\, comics\\, and other canon material. There was a clear path layed out by the material we were given that was spat on by TLJ.\\n\\nIt seems twists\\, turns. unpredictable plot (holes) and political messaging all were more important than a good and coherent story arc.\\n\\nMy hope is that we will see Episode 9 find a way to bring it all together in a satisfactory way.","true":true}
