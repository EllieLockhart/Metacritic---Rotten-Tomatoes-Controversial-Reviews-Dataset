Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie on a poor story.  Not thrilled with direction they took\\, but the 8th Star Wars film was amazing to watch.  Storyline drops score.  Force Awaken better IMHO","true":true}
