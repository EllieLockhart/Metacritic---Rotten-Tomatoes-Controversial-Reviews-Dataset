Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why the ratings are so low. It was very entertaining\\, with a good mix of action\\, humor\\, and drama. Even though it was long\\, I couldn't find a scene or story arc that was an obvious cut. I would see it again and am pumped for episode IX!","true":true}
