Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved that this movie had a story all it's own. I was at first upset over Luke's attitude\\, but I think it all comes together in a very beautiful and Star Wars like way in the end. Love the new heroes\\, especially the soul-searching Rey. And I love that there is a back and forth towards the light and the dark for almost all the main characters.","true":true}
