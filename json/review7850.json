Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent storytelling\\, scale\\, character development and arcs. Just when you think you know where Rian Johnson is taking you he decides not to. If Force Awakens is Batman Begins\\, The Last Jedi is definitely The Dark Knight pushing the boundaries of what we think a Star Wars film can do.","true":true}
