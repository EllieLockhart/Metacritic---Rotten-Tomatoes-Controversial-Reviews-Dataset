Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest fear I had when I saw TFA is that they were just going to re-do the original trilogy with a new coat of paint. I think that would have still been fine\\, and it would have made for some fun movies\\, but nothing terribly memorable.\\n\\nTLJ is really a massive plot-twist to that whole idea\\, and I personally feel that it pays off. Maybe the big thing about this movie is that it's theme is \\\"failure\\\"\\, which means that\\, yes\\, you're going to see the good guys fail\\, a lot. This can be emotionally draining\\, way more than Empire ever was\\, and I imagine that will put a lot of people off and make them feel that many parts of the movie were ultimately pointless.\\n\\nAll in all\\, I loved it and want to watch it again soon\\, and now I'm really excited for the final chapter of this trilogy.","true":true}
