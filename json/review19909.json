Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was easily one of the worst of the Star Wars movies...Leia acting like Harry Potter\\, zooming through space...really?  Luke has gone from one of the most iconic and strongest heroes to a whiny pouting hermit. Chewie was...not even in the movie...he didn't even do anything of note. I have seen the original movies easily over 60 times...this one I am not going to see it again.","true":true}
