Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has its moments\\, but overall\\, it drags and relies heavily on repetitive\\, trance-like\\, interstellar walkie-talkie moments between force-sensitive characters to move the plot along. In an era of big-budget\\, hour-long television episodes\\, The Last Jedi contributes too little to the Star Wars mythos to warrant a full-fledged film\\, and it just might leave fans wondering how much steam this franchise has left. It\u2019s more of the same old rebels fighting the same old fight\\, wondering how they\u2019ll survive\\, but vowing that the war is just beginning. Wasn\u2019t Anakin supposed to bring balance to the force? Disney seems more than willing to forget this\\, if it means filling the shelves with stuffed alien penguins just in time for the holidays.","true":true}
