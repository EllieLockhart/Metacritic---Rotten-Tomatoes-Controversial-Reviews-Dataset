Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrific film! A LOT going on and balanced much more like an episode of game of thrones than a typical Star Wars in that so many of our characters or seperated working on a slew of things. One of the Stars Wars too with more laughs but just to balance all the heavy moments. Some of the best action (and saber scenes) of any in the franchise. Lots of great new things like force powers and some great returns that we haven't seen in a while.\\n\\nThat being said\\, I'm coming out with more questions than I had going in\\, but it's a great rival to the last 2nd of the trilogy\\, Empire.","true":true}
