Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible. So fresh\\, so original\\, and so unexpected. It constantly pushes the boundaries of what a Star Wars movie can say\\, can be\\, and subverts what most people expect from it. This is probably why some people are whining about it\\, because its so new and different! Don\u2019t listen to the haters\\, they also complained about The Force Awakens for being \u201ctoo similar\u201d to earlier films\\, so they just want something to complain about. Go see it! It\u2019ll blow your mind!","true":true}
