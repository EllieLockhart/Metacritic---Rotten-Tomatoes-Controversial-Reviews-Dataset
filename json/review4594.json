Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Colossal disappointment. Sketchy CGI\\, unnecessary scenes\\, zero character development for critical players\\, and a story I just didn\u2019t like. Bad resolution\\, weird twists\\, unnecessary characters\\, and does not leave me excited for the next episode. ","true":true}
