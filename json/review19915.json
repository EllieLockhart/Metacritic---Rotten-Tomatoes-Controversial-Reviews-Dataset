Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was enjoyably awful even more comically bad then all the awful parts of the prequels combined and not making this up had most of the theater laughing during the \\\"serious\\\" parts cause they were so incredibly stupid awkward and amusingly awful that I nor could any person in the entire theater take it seriously for a second it was so awful and disturbing I could't even be mad that they managed to destroy everything that made star wars an incredible and memorable adventure along with all its fascinating characters. It had great CGI.... but it was as good of a movie as the justice league and if u wanna see another poorly written money grab support this trash and buy a ticket. Again i enjoyed the film but for all the wrong reasons and as a star wars fan it is my obligation to make sure that the film industry does not get away with giving us such a low quality film from one of the most interesting memorable franchises and an unlimited budget. You fucked up Disney u really did this movie is on mediclorians.","true":true}
