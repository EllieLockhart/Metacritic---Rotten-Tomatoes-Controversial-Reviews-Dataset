Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The circle is now complete. The prequels gave us a great story\\, with embarrassing casting and uninspired acting. Now Disney offers us beautiful visuals and great acting\\, but a nonsensical and internally inconsistent plot that  sacrifices the validity of the universe it honots for the sake of accommodating lazy writing\\, and selling new toys to kids. How is it possible for a script with this many plot holes to make it off the drawing board?","true":true}
