Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a great way to move the story on. I loved The Force Awakens\\, but can't help think that a lot of that had to do with it basically being a re-work of the original. The Last Jedi doesn't have the nostalgia of The Force Awakens\\, but puts an interesting spin on how things could (and will) move on.","true":true}
