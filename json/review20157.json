Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn\u2019t your typical Star Wars film\\, but I liked it as a sequel to The Force Awakens. It was a departure from the originals\\, but as life changes\\, other stories do as well. I liked it. It had some minor weak moments\\, but the adventure made up for it. I liked the story line with the new characters. ","true":true}
