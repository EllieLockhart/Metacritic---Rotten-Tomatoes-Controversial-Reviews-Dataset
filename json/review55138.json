{"101487":146942,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so hyped for this movie.\\nI was so ready for it to be completely different from anything I had seen in a Star Wars film before.\\n\\nWhat I was not prepared for was a 2 and half hour long dumpster fire.\\nI liked the way that many of the characters were handled\\, except for Poe.\\nHe got more resistance members killed than any first order member.\\nHe really should have been unceremoniously tossed out an airlock .\\nThere was also the problem with bombs simply falling in space  as if effected by gravity rather than having them getting launched.\\nThe biggest grievance I have with the film though was the over all plot\\, pacing\\, set up\\, and follow through. There was just too much random crap tossed into the script to allow any of the plot points to get the necessary time devoted to them to fully flesh anything out. Each sub-plot in the movie is introduced\\, given the minimum amount of exposition needed to make it seem even mildly important\\, then wrapped up in less than 10 minutes.\\nWhat this leads to is a movie with at best a disjointed story that starts off looking and feeling like Star Wars\\, then attempts to add in elements from The Great Escape\\, a few Bond films\\, some Indiana Jones\\, a little bit of The Italian Job\\, along with that part in Speed where they point out that if they slow down they'll die\\, but if they don't slow down they'll run out of gas.\\nAlso\\, lots of major characters get introduced just to fill up the body count.\\nLike their whole reason for being there is just to get enough screen time to make you like them so they can be dumped as soon as it most conveniently would impact the real main characters.\\n\\nOverall\\, worst Star Wars yet\\, and just not a good movie in general.\\nIf there's another tv series like Mystery Science Theater 3000 twenty years from now\\, The Last Jedi will be one of the first movies they roast for how bad it is.","true":true}
