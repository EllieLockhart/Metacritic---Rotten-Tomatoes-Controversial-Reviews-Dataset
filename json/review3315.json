Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before walking into the cinema like most star wars fans I had expectations and granted this movie definitely is not perfect\\, however for me I found tlj to be refreshing and I'm even more excited now to see what they do for ix. I hated how they handled Finn's character which to me kinda felt like they didn't know what to do with him that they just decided to come up with some bs from no where\\, visually I liked the casino stuff but it felt forced. The throne room however... omg so good and this part makes up for Canto Bight.","true":true}
