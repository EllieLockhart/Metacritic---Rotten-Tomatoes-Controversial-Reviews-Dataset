Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll need to go watch it again\\, but after reflecting on it\\, I was ultimately disappointed in some of the directions the main story and characters stories went. It was about a half hour too long and there could have seemingly been two endings. They made story\/character choices that while yes were surprising and different\\, but felt rushed to stand out from the rest of the pack. Did they know there was another movie after this? So much potential ultimately wasted. ","true":true}
