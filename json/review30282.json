Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Say what you will about TFA\\, but that movie succeeded undoubtedly in setting up interesting plot-lines for the two other installments of the sequel trilogy to explore - when reviewing TLJ\\, I think it productive only to review it as the middle film of a trilogy\\, and I believe in this\\, it fails to perform. It was disappointing\\, badly-paced\\, dealt extremely poorly with established character\\, exhibited unfair bias\\, and failed to make me excited for the 'thrilling' conclusion of a three-film saga.","true":true}
