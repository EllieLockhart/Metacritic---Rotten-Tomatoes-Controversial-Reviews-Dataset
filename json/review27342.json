Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Opens with a \\\"Your momma\\\" joke and only goes downhill from there. \\n\\nSeems to be doing it's absolute best to destroy the legacy and salt the earth of everything that came before it *including* The Force Awakens. Longtime hero characters are revealed to be cowards or killed offscreen. All gravitas and feelings of weight are stripped away. \\n\\nEvery question raised by the preceding film is answered with a shrug as we're told it's not important. I've watched 8 of these movies for the story and the excitement. Not to be told: None of that other stuff matters\\, just forget about it and eat your popcorn.","true":true}
