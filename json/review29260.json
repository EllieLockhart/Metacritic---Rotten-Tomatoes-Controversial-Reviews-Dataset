Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Revisionism at its finest.  The movies blows up any legacy the original movies left us with and totally crapped on anything the Force Awakens set up.  As a stand alone movie it is not good.  As a Star Wars movie it is utter tripe.\\nSide note:\\nThe new people do nothing more than bring women and people of color to the movie.  I cannot for the life of me figure out what rose and the purple haired lady had to offer other than to man hate and have the token minority.  Worst characters in any movie in 2017.","true":true}
