Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this movie\\, I say that The Last Jedi is a MILE better than The Force Awakens. Unlike\\, Episode VII\\, which was basically the plot of A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi is a fresh take on a Star Wars episode. Rian Johnson was able to use bits of humor and action to make this Episode one of the best since The Empire Strikes Back. The action and visuals were amazing\\, and there were so many plot twists (no-spoilers!) that I was on the edge of my seat seconds after the Opening Crawl finished! 5\/5 stars :)","true":true}
