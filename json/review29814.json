Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rihanna Johnson\\, the transsexual who had sex reassignment surgery during her high school years and grew a beard with the help of hormons\\, still looks and behaves like the woman he is. His name is Rian Johnson now\\, but his round face\\, low stature\\, bitchy behaviour and hatred for men betray her. She has been selected by feminazi Kathleen Kennedy because she needed a female director for Star Wars.","true":true}
