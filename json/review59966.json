Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok\\, I'll explain why this game is awful (in my opinion). First problem is characters. No character development\\, no understandable motivation. It doesnt matter if Joel killed or not. It matters how he was killed. Just rush-in storyline\\, without any expectations. And it is not that Joel that we know from part 1. Same thing i can say bout Ellie. She just became bipolar girl with no logic in her moves. Dina - was deleted too early. Jessie - I dunno waht to say.. Just killed... Without any character explanation. Ebby - idk\\, maybe some people liked to play as her\\, but for me it was 10 hours of misery. I just aint wanna to play as that character even if Druckman shows us story bout her humanity\\, like saving zebras or dogs. Ebbie team is also awful\\, cmn\\, 8-month pregnant girl\\, best doctor in the camp\\, just went killing zombies and other guys.\r\rSummary:\rGraphic - 9\/10\rDetails - 9\/10\rGameplay - 4\/10\rStory - 1\/10\rCharacters - 1\/10\rMorality - 1\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
