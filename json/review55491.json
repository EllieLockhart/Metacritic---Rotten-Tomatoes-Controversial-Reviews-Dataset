Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My 2 star rating comes from the Star Wars fan in me\\, plain and simple.  You get 2 stars for being a Star Wars movie.  But that's all you get.\\n\\nMuch of the action was well done.  There are several important scenes that move this new trilogy in the direction it needs to go.  I don't even take issue with some of the controversial events.  Everyone else already has anyway.  You don't need to hear my opinion on it.\\n\\nBut\\, if you take all the action and all the important scenes and strung them together\\, you'd end up with about an hour and a half of movie.  Instead we got two and a half hours of it.  An entire hour of screen time\\, about 40% of the total length\\, is a complete mess.\\n\\nThe plot holes simply cannot be overlooked.  While the action sequences are pretty good\\, the reasons that they occur are not.  There are no reasons for any of it.  This falls squarely on the shoulders of Rian Johnson.  Clearly he had a story to tell\\, but was not a talented enough director or screenwriter to do it.\\n\\nWhat praise The Last Jedi has gotten\\, so far\\, commend it for being \\\"risky\\\" and \\\"ambitious\\\".  But actually\\, it is neither one of those things\\, unless you count hiring a director with exactly two mediocre\/ok movies under his belt as the risk\\, and the fact that clearly he thought he was up to it as the ambition.\\n\\nThe first movie of this new trilogy\\, The Force Awakens\\, asks several key questions and seems to want to set up several key events.  Johnson then treats that with total scorn\\, as if he's determined to make his own movie his own way and wants nothing to do with what some other director & screenwriter set up.  But as the guy at the helm of a sequel\\, the middle movie of a trilogy\\, that was arguably his entire job.  Imagine if he had directed his episodes of Breaking Bad the same way - with no regard for what had already been established\\, and total contempt for the directors\/writers that would have to clean up his mess.  He would have been fired.\\n\\nForget for a minute that The Last Jedi is a Star Wars movie.  Just think of it as an action movie.  Action movies are not exactly high art\\, but you do need a few basic elements to make them work.  The characters need a meaningful story arc\\, a reason why they've ended up in the middle of the shooting.  The action sequences\\, especially extended action sequences\\, need to be set up in some kind of plausible way.  The plot needs to be coherent enough to tie the first two things together.  The Last Jedi fails in every respect.  This makes it not only a bad Star Wars movie\\, but a just plain bad movie.","true":true}
