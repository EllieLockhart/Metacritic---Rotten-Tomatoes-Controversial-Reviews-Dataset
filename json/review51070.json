Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely disgraceful. Luke is now a grumpy old hermit? The first order are more of a joke then a threat? Phasma wasted again? Snoke wasted with absolutely nothing about him explained? No explanation for Rey's freakish force abilities? And suddenly force ghosts can affect the physical realm? And using the force can kill you? What have you done disney & RJ?","true":true}
