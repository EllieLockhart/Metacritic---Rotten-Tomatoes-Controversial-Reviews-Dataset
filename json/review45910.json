Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"VFX were great\\, sound was great\\, practicle effects were great.\\nFloating force Leia was aweful.\\nThe amount of comedy ruined the tone.\\nThe entire casino\/hacker subplot was terrible.\\nSnoke meant nothing.\\nRei's parents were a red herring.\\nLuke doesn't act like Luke.\\nplot holes plot holes plot holes.\\nLuke dies for noi reason\\, snoke dies for no reason\\, Rei is the most powerful force weilder for no reason\\, Phasma dies for no reason.\\nThere was just so much wrong with this movie. The only things I enjoyed were the vfx\\, sound\\, and effects.","true":true}
