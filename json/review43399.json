Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an excellent installment to the Star Wars saga. It refocused the direction that Abrams had set out in TFA. Fanboys are going to tell you that the film doesn't meet up to expectations\\, but I believe it meets every goal it sets out to make. See it for yourself\\, focus on the paths and development of the new characters\\, and marvel at Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ten.","true":true}
