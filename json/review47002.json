Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing movie!  Some of the fight scenes are fun\\, but upon reflection you quickly realize this movie single-handedly destroys so much of the legacy that made Star Wars great. This is the worst insult imaginable to the star wars saga.\\nWay too many plot holes and inconsistencies!\\nCool special effects\\, but too many plot twists that don't make any sense.","true":true}
