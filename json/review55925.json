Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson effectively sabotaged the Star Wars franchise through incoherently political corporate storytelling. This is essentially the Star Wars trilogy if the dark side wanted to trash the series. You could spend over 3 hours discussing just how completely disgraceful this movie is. I'm surprised that all the actors felt comfortable creating it because it's cluttered with endless contradictions and blatantly obvious social propaganda. \\n\\nNow people are acting like poor viewer ratings are \\\"fake news\\\"? Give me a break. Like critics dont ever get paid to give good reviews? This movie will go down as worse than any of the Star Wars films\\, and I would give this movie negative stars if I could. Everyday that passes I think it's worse than the day before. I can't stress enough h\\n\\nNo incentive to watch the next film. I'll pass.","true":true}
