Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":".This is a great film. You don't end up understanding it straight away and a lot of fans don't have an open-mind to the new concepts it has. It's Star Wars and I love it - yeah it's not perfect to what you imagined but its not YOUR screenplay.","true":true}
