Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is Star Wars worth saving anymore? If it is\\, here's some possibilities. 1.Petition Disney to relent the films\\, sell it or franchise it out to other production companies. 2. Persuade the big companies to buy it off Disney. Apple would be a good choice. 3. Make your own Star Wars movie If you can afford it or start a kickstarter campaign. \\nIf the film is good enough but Disney tries to terminate the production of it\\, sell the film to them.\\n\\nThe main problem with the last two films was they were rushed. I've a feeling they made quickly because Disney were worried at least one of the three older cast members would pass away and they had to justify getting they're money back quickly after spending 3 Billion. So Last Jedi has to follow up TFA because it has to\\, it's a trilogy\\, it's already following a film that was made in haste. So without even seeing Last Jedi i can tell that it's already fallen flat. I won't see it. i'm not their audience. What's dividing the fans is Disney doesn't want to scare anyone so the films will be as safe as possible and have plenty of political correctness sellotaped on to it.","true":true}
