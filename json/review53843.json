Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here is why The Last Jedi is awesome! (NO SPOILERS).\\nIgnore the audience reviews and go see this movie. But remember this old advice from Yoda and Obi Wan:\\n\\\"You must unlearn what you have learned.\\\" \\\"The truth is often what we make of it; you heard what you wanted to hear\\, believed what you wanted to believe.\\\" \\\"Much to learn you still have.\\\"\\n \\\"But how am I to know the good side from the bad?\\\" Luke's question could be applied to this movie-how are we to know if it is good? Yoda's answer is instructive: \\\"You will know\\, when you are calm\\, at peace\\, passive.\\\"  \\\"But beware of the dark side. Anger\\, fear\\, aggression\\, the dark side of the force are they.\\\"\\nThe amount of anger directed at this film by many who consider themselves die hard Star Wars fans is disturbing. Calm down people! And listen carefully to what is being taught to us about the force. You must keep an open mind\\, pay attention\\, and be humble. Pride is the downfall of the Jedi. If you allow it\\, pride will also blind you to the awesomeness of this movie\\, and to the lessons we need to learn from it. Then we can also appreciate the amazing action\\, the campy Star Wars humor\\, the beautiful visual spectacle\\, and the flawed yet wonderful characters.\\nLuke warns us in the trailer\\, \\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\" That's an understatement\\, and many are mad about it. But you needn't be. You will see the failures the characters experience are not plot holes-but essential to the journey of these characters\\, and to our journey through this saga. You will see that the characters who are nobody and whose moments seem undeserved are in fact the profound point of it all. This is a rebellion for all people from the heroic legends of old to the lowliest rebel scum. The force is greater than any Jedi or family blood line. It flows through every living thing. Accept that\\, and you will love this movie!","true":true}
