Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abysmal plot\\, abysmal character development. Awful comedy in places where it should be serious instead. Worst Star Wars movie since Phantom Menace. Milk? Obscene and uneccessary\\, I mean\\, we get that he's living off the land\\, thanks. Complete waste of a potentially good character with Snoke. Total letdown with Rey's origin\\, and could have kept the facts the same yet make the story better. Did we really need to repeat the hoth battle scene for act 2 again? Is there no originality? I mean Big Death Star in Act 1\\, Hoth again in Act 2.  Come on.  Too many plot points that really go nowhere\\, Rey's training a joke. Special effects\\, sound effects\\, fight scenes\\, those were great and the only reason to go see it. Everything else was awful.  Oh and the ending\\, old bastard just overexerts himself.  Ruined.","true":true}
