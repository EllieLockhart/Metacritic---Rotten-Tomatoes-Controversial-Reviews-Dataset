Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a solid movie. Regardless\\, of how busy it is\\, I still left the theatre satisfied. People are upset because their personal fan theory proved wrong\\, and some people just like to complain. Especially\\, if it's the trendy thing to do.","true":true}
