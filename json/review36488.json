Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie begins at light speed and doesn't let go through the entire film. As a long time fan\\, I rank this one up there with Empire Strikes Back. The action is intense\\, the storyline is exciting and original\\, the characters are well fleshed out\\, and the special effects are perhaps the best of any movie I've ever seen. \\n\\nI wholeheartedly recommend it. The child in me was inspired and awed throughout.","true":true}
