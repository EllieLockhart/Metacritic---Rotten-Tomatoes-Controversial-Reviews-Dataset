Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie well enough on the first viewing\\, aside from the writer's take on Luke Skywalker.  However\\, I found very little to delight in while rewatching The Last Jedi.  What is Star Wars for\\, if not to bring joy through cinematic storytelling?  The visuals\\, music\\, and casting we're all fantastic\\, but the story could be improved on.","true":true}
