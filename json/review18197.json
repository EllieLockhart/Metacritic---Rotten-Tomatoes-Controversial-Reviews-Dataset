Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was pretty good and entertaining. I like the idea of letting the past die. Who cares. Sorry your space samurai movie didn't go they way you wanted\\, lol.","true":true}
