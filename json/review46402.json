Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was probably the worst Star Wars movie ever made. \\nThe best part was seeing Yoda again and that scene was still not great.\\nNothing made sense in this movie. This new star wars series is loosing the essence of star wars it doesn't feel like a star wars movie. Even in the the beginning of the movie\\, When does a x1 even come close to out maneuvering a tai fighter with such ease.  \\nWhy not just send invincible Poe against the entire imperial fleet over and over again.... \\nnothing makes sense in this new star wars universe.","true":true}
