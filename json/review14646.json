Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have literally grown up with this franchise as I am 44.  I expected to see many changes with the new characters over the years.  I suffered through the prequels\\, but knew the set up and the story were relevant to the creation of vader and the subsequent story of Ep. 4\\,5\\, and 6.  The force awakens did carry the story after a long absence. it holds water and sets us up for what could be a great next chapter in this universe.  however\\, it bombed on so many levels that I will probably not go see the third installment of this trilogy.  I have seen every other movie in this franchise multiple times in the theater and on vcr\/dvd\/blu ray.  Not this time.  I was concerned when lucas gave up the reins and got his pay out.  I figured it was just butterflies.  unfortunately\\, it turned out to be Montezuma's revenge.  good bye star wars.....","true":true}
