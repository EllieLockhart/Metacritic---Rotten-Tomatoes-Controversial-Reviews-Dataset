Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, I went into this movie with low expectations\\, and walked out blown away. All the people who gave this film a 0 or .5 score need to stop hyping these big budget movies up in their heads\\, and watch them for what they are. ENTERTAINING FILMS. I mean they don\u2019t have the cinematography of a Nolan movie\\, or the humor of a Tarantino movie. They are just made to please the general audience. With that being said\\, watch them for what they are\\, and stop listening to what the fans are saying.","true":true}
