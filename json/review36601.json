{"101487":176577,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a beautiful garbage fire. Just like the post-modern era of art\\, they trample on the glories of the past with wanton destruction reminiscent of a bad Michael Bay film with the added pungent smell of the pessimistic outlook of a blue haired social justice non-binary other-kin. This series abandoned the soul of series in favor of the modern anti-trump antifa sympathizing Weinstein-loving man-hating bigotry of Hollywood and [SPOILER ALERT: STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET.] condensed that fine liqueur of hatred into a single action that Luke Skywalker took in a flashback that undoes the legendary status that Luke Skywalker holds on media as a whole. Luke would never have raised a lightsaber on one of his own students\\, let alone the son of Han Solo. To suggest that the same person who found good in his Father\\, a man modeled after Hitler himself\\, would even consider killing a defenseless child to prevent an evil future... is not only unrealistic\\, but also a decision that could have only been made by a writer who does not understand the character in any aspect and actively hates fans of the original series. The movie has lots of other problems\\, but this one is the biggest. If we're speaking about problems in a more general sense\\, the biggest overall problem with every one of the characters is that they build up certain characters in the trailers that only get about five minutes of screen time before they are killed off. For example\\, Snoke is built up to be a significant character\\, however\\, he is killed off unceremoniously before we know anything about him whatsoever. Same thing goes for Captain Phasma and many other characters that were promised in the trailers. The main characters also suffer from a lack of personality\\, and unlike previous Star Wars films\\, any sign of personality from the characters is punished almost immediately\\, especially with male characters. Poe tried to genuinely help this random purple haired general who came out of nowhere and took over the Rebels and she refused to communicate with him\\, and this resulted in the deaths and capture of several rebels where if she had just acted like a decent person and told him the plan\\, several escape ships would have been saved. There was a completely pointless arc in the movie where Finn and random asain chick Rey replacement named Rose (who literally is a character formed to appease the social justice fascists) destroy a casino. They did this looking for a code breaker who would eventually betray them. This entire scene did not need to be in the movie\\, and was essentially the giant corporation known as Disney criticizing capitalism in a way that was extremely preachy and cringey... The actress who played Rose seems like a random chick they found in a line to see the Force Awakens who was just excited to be in a Star Wars film... so much so that she almost breaks the fourth and I half expected her to look at the screen and say \\\"Oh my god\\, I'm in Star Wars\\, I'm so happy\\, Hi mom.\\\" Rian only put her in the film to pat himself on the back for being a good ally. This movie is bad. Very bad. Don't see it. Just go rewatch the original trilogy and pretend this movie doesn't exist. Forget about new Star Wars films and go read the books that are now not cannon. They are much better than this trash writing. Also go play Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2\\, those games deserve to be made into a movie\\, not this crap.","true":true}
