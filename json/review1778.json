Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan this movie brought no justice. And I feel betrayed. The average movie goer will enjoy it as it it well acted and the well directed. But the story direction was all so wrong. That is all.","true":true}
