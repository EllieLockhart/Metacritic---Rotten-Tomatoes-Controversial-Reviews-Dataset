Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the best Star Wars films. My husband and I absolutely loved it - from the story\\, to the lighting and cinematography\\, everything. I know a lot of folks are upset about the treatment of certain characters\\, but I think the direction the story is going is not only working\\, but necessary. The Jedi were flawed\\, but were so powerful and pompous they could not see their own mistakes. Mistakes that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Mistakes Luke repeated because he did not know better\\, creating Kylo Ren. It is time for a new generation to choose their own path\\, without the doctrine of the Jedi. Make new mistakes\\, absolutely\\, but learn from them without the pressure of the Jedi to be perfect. It is something I have wanted to see treated in every previous film\\, and The Last Jedi finally does that - and does it well.","true":true}
