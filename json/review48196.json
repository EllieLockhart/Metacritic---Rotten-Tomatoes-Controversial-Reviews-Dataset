Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst it seems not everyone is finding The Last Jedi is living up to 30+ years of built up expectation around this film\\, I got lucky and sat down in the cinema without expectation and found this movie was a very fun\\, enjoyable and rewarding ride :-)","true":true}
