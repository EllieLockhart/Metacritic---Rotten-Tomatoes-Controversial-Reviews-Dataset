Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every approach to tying up loose ends from episode 7 was done poorly. The subplots are far from entertaining and the film was not at all satisfying. If you had any fan theories of your own about Rey\\, Snoke\\, the knights of ren\\, etc. just be prepared - Disney took a huge dump on them.","true":true}
