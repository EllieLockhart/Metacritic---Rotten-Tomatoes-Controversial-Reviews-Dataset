Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I have never left a review before but feel a need to in order to save the Star Wars series I love. If u want a movie that has gigantic plot holes\\, Leia flying like Mary Poppins through space\\, and boring characters\\, you have come to the right place. Half of the movie could have been deleted if Poe was just told Leai's and that pink hair ladie's plan. Btw she didn't have to sacrifice her life. Ur telling me they didn't have auto pilot on that ship? I digress. Also the prolonged terrible casino scene would have never had to have happened if Poe was told the plan. Who is Snoke? What is his purpose? Nobody knows. Bored the whole time and felt like my childhood had been ruined. Ruined Luke's character. It's hurts me to say this\\, but I don't think I will be seeing the third movie. Nothing made me want to see what happens next in this trilogy after seeing this movie.","true":true}
