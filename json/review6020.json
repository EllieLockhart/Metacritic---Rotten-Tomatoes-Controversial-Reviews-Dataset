Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointment might be the best word to describe The Last Jedi. It has not of the heart or fun of The Force Awakens\\, or the original trilogy and Rogue One for that matter. \\n\\nThe story is thin\\, the trip to the casino planet is a little to prequel like for my taste and and the use of Luke Skywalker (without spoilers) is dumb and wasted\\, especially after such a build up to his appearance in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe best part of the movie is the opening sequence and there is a fight scene later that works very well\\, but the rest of the movie is just kind of blah.","true":true}
