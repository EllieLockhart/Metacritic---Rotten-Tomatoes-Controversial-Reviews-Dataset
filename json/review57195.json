Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars movie I've seen. Even TPM is better\\, and even much better in some respects. I actually considered leaving the theatre at some point. Something I don't think I've ever considered doing before. The absolute worst part of the movie is the obvious political commentary. Star Wars is not supposed to be about contemporary politics. It's supposed to be about fun and the retelling of the classic stories that Lucas laid as the foundation for the first movie back in 77. It almost seems like the purpose of this movie was to destroy Star Wars as a pop culture phenomenon\\, and I'm tempted to say they succeeded\\, as the next Star Wars movie has to be pretty special for me to consider paying for watching it. Too bad. For me\\, for the time being at least\\, the Star Wars journey has ended.","true":true}
