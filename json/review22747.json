Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally my least liked film I\u00e2(TM)ve ever watched. Ruin Johnson took a giant dump on SW and the fandom. I\u00e2(TM)m not some \u00e2hater\u00e2? I love all SW movies that have come out\\, except this pile of shit. The only people who liked this are the ones that have no clue what Star Wars is (clearly many \u00e2critics\u00e2?) and some misguided fans. I really hope Ruin comes out with that SW trilogy just so the fandom can show him how disliked he was as a director.\\n\\nThis man literally hired friends and people with no business being on the set of such a big movie just to agree with his singular vision. Lucas had Kurtz and Ruin has his crappy interperatation of SW like it\u00e2(TM)s a Star Trek film crossed with Guardians of the Galaxy humor (he couldn\u00e2(TM)t even get the damn humor right because he\u00e2(TM)s sloppy). If the film was independent of the SW franchise\\, it\u00e2(TM)d be ok\\, but it\u00e2(TM)s not and makes for an amazingly horrible story. Plan and simple.","true":true}
