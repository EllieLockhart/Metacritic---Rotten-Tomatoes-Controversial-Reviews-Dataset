Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the jokes were pretty funny but it couldn't make up for the relentless sjw hammering. Laura Dern? UGHh!! I am so sick of the preachy sjw\/feminist bs. When are movies going to start being fun and stop being programming? Every single movie preview was pushing trans humanism. Their agenda is so clear and SO BORING!!! No wonder Hollyweird is failing and being taken over by the Chinese!!","true":true}
