Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m very satisfied with this film - it\u2019s confidence in building a new storyline mixed in with great Disney humor. Nothing over-the-top\\, in my opinion. A must see. ","true":true}
