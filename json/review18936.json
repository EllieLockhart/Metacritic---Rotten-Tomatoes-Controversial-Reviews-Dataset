Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a very well made run of the mill sci fi flick\\, but such a poor star wars film. up there with Phantom menace and attack of the clones\\, and at least they had heart. This film is very soulless\\, characters you can't relate to or care about\\, social agendas being shoved down your throat.","true":true}
