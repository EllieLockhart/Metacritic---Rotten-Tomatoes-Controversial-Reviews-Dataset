{"101487":132926,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were hoping\\, as I was\\, that Rian Johnson\\, was going to save the new Star Wars series... you were wrong.\\n\\nI'm not entirely sure if the critics were watching the same movie as i was because when I left the cinema\\, I felt lost and confused about what it was that i had just watched\\, it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.\\nSure it had stormtroopers\\, lightsabers\\, and Jedi but..\\n\\nOverall Story was ok\\, at best\\, sure i liked the idea of a slow chase but at the same time it felt like a bottle episode of a tv show.\\n\\nThe Sub story of Finn and the new girl\\, (who at this moment escapes my memory and basically couldn't care less about\\, so not going to waste my time with googling her identity) i think in the Bluray and digital download they should George Lucas that bit and edit it out entirely\\, if i wanted a side story about an animal loving\\, depressed hippy\\, I'd... oh wait i wouldn't ever want that in a Sci-Fi cause I don't want to hear about it now! It was pointless which yes we all know that happens in life\\, but we don't need that demoralising crap in our movie\\, especially this movie franchise when it's been so full of Hope.\\n\\nI'd give it 5 stars because of the fantastic fight against those guards\\, oh and Luke showing up\\, and fighting but then you have every part of your childhood ripped from inside you when you find out *SPOILERS* Luke isn't there.\\n\\nAnd don't get me started on Luke\\, my trail of thought was Luke went away to his island\\, to see what he could Learn about Snoke and\\, was doing some form of secret Jedi training stuff\\, talking to Yoda\\, Ben and his Dad\\, maybe even Qui Gon\\, so he could come back and kick Snokes butt. or Train Rey to do it\\, but no Luke turned into a grumpy old man. a Dick even. Mark Hamill himself\\, said it best \\\"I fundamentally disagree with the direction he took Luke\\\". and maybe Rian Johnson should have listened to the bloke\\, who you know\\, IS Luke Skywalker.. \\n\\nMy Edits would be:\\n\\n1. Get rid of the Finn and new girl story\\n2. Give Rey some character development\\, and actually give her a weakness\/faults (all heroes have them) instead of making her a god\\, or one of those kids thats perfect at everything and can do anything instantly\\, no one likes a show off. or a boring character.\\n3. Get rid of Captain Holdo and replace with Admiral Ackbar\\, (You could say Poe's sudden Coup\\, was an act out of fear\\, and panic but it wasn't portayed that way so edit that whole mutiny out)\\n4. Leia floating in space\\, just do something about that\\, a force protection shield\\, just a as long as it's not her floating and then doing her best Superman\/woman impression.\\n5. Luke should have stored away on the falcon and actually faced Ren and been THAT powerful. plus still you know be around.\\n6. Ren and Rey could have teamed up\\, destroyed the bad guys\\, only for (in episode 9) Ren to double cross Rey\\, and use the Knights of Ren to hunt down the resistance\\, massive fight at the end of 9 between Luke\\, Rey\\, Ren and Knights. And since that Daisy Ridley doesn't want to play Rey after 9 they could have the Knights and Ren Win. wait another 10 years. new Trilogy.  \\n\\nFinal word:\\nI think that the problem is\\, it's not that Rain Johnson is a bad director it's that some directors just shouldn't write and direct these movies\\, in particular.","true":true}
