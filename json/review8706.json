Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flies above Force Awakens but it has its flaws. The middle is a little slow. This is a great film in the Star Wars saga but it\u2019s no Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since Empire\\, but it doesn\u2019t beat it. It has me very excited and intrigued to see how it all plays out in episode IX","true":true}
