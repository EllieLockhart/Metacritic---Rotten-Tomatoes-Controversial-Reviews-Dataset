Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually-stunning\\, emotionally-gripping\\, and full of extensive mythological properties. Through great character interactions\\, the film's triumph comes from Luke Skywalker\\, who after broken by his past\\, has spiritually grown to view The Force as a form of guidance and stability rather power or entitlement. \\nWhile the film's subplots add nothing more than mindless distraction and tend to drag the film on\\, The Last Jedi is still entertaining\\, thoughtful\\, and challenging enough to continue and evolve Star Wars for a new generation.","true":true}
