Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed. I think I actually liked Revenge of the Sith better than this one. So many things wrong\\, I don't even know where to start. I loved The Force Awakens\\, was so looking forward to this.","true":true}
