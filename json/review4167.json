Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"butchered lukes character. Made a hero\\, that already faced down his father a dark lord\\, and turn him\\, along with facing the emperor into a whiny coward. Way too many unexplained characters that were built up and hyped up. More plot holes than pot holes in Wisconsin\\, and it felt like Rosie Od wrote the comedic script. It also was surprisingly political\\, but if you didn't catch that then i won't get into it. So let down by this movie","true":true}
