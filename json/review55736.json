Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Original Fan\\\" over here. Loved the original\\, even enjoyed some of TFA. Was looking forward to some characters being developed\\, such as Finn. His part in the movie feels pointless\\, and same with his new friend Rose. Since these new movies lack any romance\\, looks like they were able to slap in a hot and heavy smooch between the two!\\nHorrible character development.\\nOld heroes ruined. Leia's float scene was so cheesy and lame.\\nIn the force awakens\\, I liked how Abrams made the force a spiritual thing again\\, not just acrobats. But this movie took the spiritual aspect to a whole new horrible level. The way Rey and Kyle communicate didn't feel right. That ain't STAR WARS. Glad the audience agrees with me. These \\\"critics\\\" are too careful not to give feminists a hard time. \\nThe series has turned a bad ass rebellion into a cowardly group that runs away and fights \\\"smarter\\\". That's what happens when you let women take the reigns.\\nAs a women myself\\, I could care less about movies pushing social justice and feminism. I just want to see macho badasses go at it like they used to when movies were good. \\nAs I watched the movie\\, I could feel the feminist and social justice agenda. Made me enjoy it less. \\nJust make the characters have good development so I don't notice the \\\"agenda\\\" next time.","true":true}
