{"101487":136594,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm honestly baffled by people that are like \\\"this movie panders too much to women!!! this scars my male self!!\\\" OR the people who assume everyone who disliked this film is some hypocritical white fanboy. The Last Jedi was poorly written and disappointing for many reasons\\, and not one of them was because the movie was trying to empower me as a woman\\, haha. All of the most enjoyable and likable characters were shafted\\, whether they were from the original series or The Force Awakens\\, including Finn\\, Poe\\, and of course Rose\\, whom I had looked forward to a lot. Rey deserves more interesting material and far better company than her arc with Kylo. Characters make decisions that make no sense. Things that make no sense just happen. There is a strong lack of continuity with characterization\\, story-telling\\, and even cinematography. The battles were all disheartening but did not build toward any meaningful message about overcoming failure or holding on to hope. I was just meh about or REALLY disliked all the twists in the movie\\, whether it was the unnecessary romance that screwed up two characters who would have been amazing if they individually had strong roles\\, the gross attraction involving our hero and poor misunderstood mass murderer Kylo\\, the fact that the admiral lady could not\\, for some mystical reason\\, tell Poe the truth and wasted absolutely everyone's time and efforts\\, and that random kid at the end who I unfortunately am not interested in at all. And that's not even touching on Luke. I truly do not understand how you could be invested in anything that has happened within this universe and enjoy this script. I do not understand what this movie was attempting to be - Mark Hamill calls Star Wars escapism\\, so why was this just a depressing reflection of how the Disney corporation operates? Cheap attempts at acting progressive without a strong script to make anything matter or be emotionally impactful. I never leave reviews like this\\, but I am just so stunned by how bad this film is\\, not even just in comparison to my expectations and personal hopes for characters I like\\, but as a piece of writing\\, as a story that was put in front of kids' faces.","true":true}
