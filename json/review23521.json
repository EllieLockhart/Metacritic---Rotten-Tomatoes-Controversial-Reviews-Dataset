Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this film! A lot of depth to it. I've seen it three times and keep making new connections\/realizations with each viewing. A lot of nerds\/know-it-all\/fixed mindset people crying about this movie... not for those without some experience with life\/human character. It's not black and white\\, lots of grey in there...","true":true}
