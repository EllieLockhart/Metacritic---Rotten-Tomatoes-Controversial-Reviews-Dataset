Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If episode 7 was a love letter to past movies then episode 8 throws the old rules out the exhaust port. This is a beautifully directed\\, written\\, and acted movie. Nothing will be as you expect; Luke wasn't kidding when he said \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think.\\\" This movie is bound to be divisive\\, but it moves the series in exciting new directions.\\n\\nGo in as blind as you can and enjoy one of the best movies of 2017!","true":true}
