Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All is already said\\, It's a bad movie\\, and much worse for being a Star Wars movie. It also destroys itelf\\, it has zero logic\\, all the movie is about a chase\\, how The Empire can't reach the rebels\\, but there's vessels coming in and out\\, no fucking sense.\\n\\nDumb bombers\\, grumpy Skywalker\\, no sense if you follow the script of the 7th film(why snkoke wanted to meet Rei? Where's the training for Kylo? He only insults him)....\\n\\nJust horrible.","true":true}
