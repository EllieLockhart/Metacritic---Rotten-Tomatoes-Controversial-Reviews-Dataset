Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what people were expecting to see from a Rian Johnson Star Wars movie. Instead of being a remake of Empire\\, as TFW was of SW this is something else entirely. Energetic\\, surprising\\, scary\\, jolting\\, hilarious\\, terrifying and downright fun. I loved every second of it.","true":true}
