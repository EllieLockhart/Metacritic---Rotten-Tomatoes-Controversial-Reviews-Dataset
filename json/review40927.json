Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroys every plot line from number 7. Episode 7 was a lazy movie in itself but it at least had some things that made you interested in where the story could go. This movie made a point to not answer any of those questions and end anything that would have made me interested in seeing episode 9.","true":true}
