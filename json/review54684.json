Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand the negative reaction on here\\, this entry in to the franchise was the most refreshing since Revenge of the Sith. Many running plot lines with unexpected twists. Some good lessons that you typically don't get out of Star Wars. A more subdued and less optimistic movie with awesome combat scenes. There is some off parts\\, but considering where we left off in TFA I'm really pleased. It is unconventional\\, conflicted\\, and darker than I was expecting.","true":true}
