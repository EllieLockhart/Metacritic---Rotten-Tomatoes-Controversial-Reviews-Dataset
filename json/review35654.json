Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an entertaining action flick that is vastly better than The Force Awakens.  While there were a number of interesting plot twists\\, lack of character development was what made this movie good instead of great.  Plenty of interesting room for plot growth remains.","true":true}
