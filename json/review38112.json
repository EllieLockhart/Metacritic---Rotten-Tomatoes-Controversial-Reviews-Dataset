Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was garbage and also wasted 30 minutes on a plot line that didn't have any relevance. Portrayals of some characters and some of the starwars universe were way off and makes me wish this movie was never made.","true":true}
