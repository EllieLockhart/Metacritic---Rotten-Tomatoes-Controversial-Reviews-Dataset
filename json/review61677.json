Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I was waiting for this game since the last one ended I thought that if the first game was this great the sequel would be better\\, but I was disappointed with this game so much that I don't think they can fix the series anymore\\, first of all the way they tricked us into thinking that jole would be a huge part of the game and then they just kill him in the first hour or two and not just that the way they killed him is so bad and humiliating \\, jole would never drop his guard like that in the first game jole was smart he knew how to survive and that is why he was the best character in the game.Secondly you had the audacity to make us play as his killer abby for half the game!!!The story was written so bad that I got so bored in the first 10 hours of the game and the characters were not relatable and boring\\,And the ending is the worst ending I ever saw.The only good thing in this game is the gameplay because it's similar to the original.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
