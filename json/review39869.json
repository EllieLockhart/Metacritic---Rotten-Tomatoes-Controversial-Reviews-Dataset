Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very\\, very stupid movie\\, and incredibly disrespectful to the original series. It's as if a very intelligent movie director was tasked with making the worst movie he could. It's not just bad\\, it's bad in millions of little ways\\, along with most of the big ones.","true":true}
