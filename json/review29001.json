Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed this movie. As a dad who took his son it was a perfect afternoon. Witty\\, good drama and fab action. It's never going to win Oscars for its script but it does everything that a star wars film is meant to do.\\nCan only say to ignore the trolls thst seem out to stop people enjoying this film. See it and judge for yourselves.","true":true}
