Graphics were incredible and that's where it gets most of it's score from me. Story lagged on for to long and at times was just down right boring. The way they tried to make you feel sympathy for Abby fell flat.there literally was no sympathy I could give. The voice acting at times was just bad. I blame the story more then the voice actingWas disappointed with the story to this game. Graphics were incredible and that's where it gets most of it's score from me. Story lagged on for to long and at times was just down right boring. The way they tried to make you feel sympathy for Abby fell flat.there literally was no sympathy I could give. The voice acting at times was just bad. I blame the story more then the voice acting though. The conversation in the beginning between Abby and Owen was cringe worthy.Killing of one of the main characters is fine it's been done before.  The way it was done almost seemed like it was done to spite fans. Unlike the first game non of the characters stood out. This seemed like a bad Godzilla movie where you go to see the monster fights but end up getting 2 hours of the characters and a half hour of the monsters. What happened to all the infected? Did they just step aside so everyone can get over their it's complicated?Not Naughty Dog's best showing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
