{"101487":178368,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a lot to love about the latest installment of the Star Wars franchise\\, and just a few cringe-worthy choices. Some spoilers ahead. \\n\\nWriting. Okay\\, there's quite a bit of controversy about the humour in this movie. Described as \\\"slapstick\\\" and \\\"inappropriate\\\" - these criticisms are only half-true. The comedic elements are more pronounced than in Episodes 4-6\\, but retain the same appreciation of kitsch and humility that the original series engendered. I understand why some fans might feel it is disrespectful to bring such breaks in the tension\\, but I it gives more room for the actors - Mark Hamill in particular - to fill out their characters. This shift to heavier-handed comedy comes right out of Disney's playbook (see: every animated Disney movie since\\, what\\, Aladdin?) and that alone may turn some viewers off. \\n\\nThe new characters are likeable enough\\, but their lines tend to be a bit wooden\\, as if drawn from a template. Poor Finn is given very little to work with and delivers the most cringe-worthy line of the film in his scene with Phasma. \\n\\nPlot. Pacing is where The Last Jedi makes up for the plodding\\, confused Rogue One\\, and improves upon The Force Awakens. The better part of three hours flies by as deftly as Dameron's X-Wing (RIP). This places it in stark contrast to the single-minded cattle-run of Rogue One or the uneven hobble of The Force Awakens. \\n\\nThe film draws heavily on The Empire Strikes Back.  In both\\, the ragtag team of good guys is divided into multiple\\, distinct story-lines; the hero is relegated to the far reaches of the galaxy to hone their Jedi skills; a charistmatic\\, chaotic-neutral character from a glamorous planet offers help and betrayal; there is a kiss\\, a genealogical \\\"reveal\\\"\\, force-powered telepathy... you get the idea. \\nUltimately\\, the plot is effective as a bridge episode in a trilogy\\, but the ending felt a more \\\"after-school special\\\" to me than \\\"cliff-hanger\\\". \\n\\nCharacters. Here\\, the writers leapt to introduce new characters before we really learned to love the older ones and that's a shame. While they did an excellent job developing Kylo Ren's and\\, arguably\\, Rey's characters\\, their emphasis left little room for the rest of the cast. Finn\\, as mentioned\\, was given some truly terrible lines of dialogue and a clumsy pseudo-romance with new character Rose Tico. Poe Dameron wasn't given any more depth or backstory\\, just a clownish rendering of a hot-headed stereotype. Phasma\\, bless her steely heart\\, was robbed of virtually any meaningful characterization. Even Snoke was a two-dimensional cut-out of Emperor Palpatine\\, though Andy Serkis brought a decent effort to \\\"act in\\\" some compelling humanity. The other new characters\\, Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and DJ (Benicio del Toro\\, in the worst naming of the film) presented fertile ground for character development\\, but were simply not given the attention to do so.  In this sense\\, character development was all about the Kylo\/Rey show\\, a gamble that didn't really pay off. \\n\\nProduction. The cinematography was very good\\, and at times had a lyric quality that stands out in the franchise. That said... Please. Stop. With. The. CG. Characters. I really hoped we'd escaped the uncanny valley. We haven't. I was worried that the porgs would play a bigger role a la Jar Jar Binks. Gratefully\\, they didn't. Still doesn't forgive the CG Snoke\\, the vulptices (ice foxes)\\, or fathiers (tauntaun-meets avatar horses). Sound design was good\\, though not quite as good as in The Force awakens. Editing was effective\\, and I rarely felt like entire plot lines had been butchered for the final product. Costume and character design feel like they were done with merchandise and cos-play first\\, narrative second. \\nConclusion. Go see this film. It's funny\\, it's tender\\, it brings new perspective to the Star Wars universe. There are some very good moments from almost all the actors\\, and beautiful visuals. In this case\\, the ambition of the film lets me overlook the failings.","true":true}
