Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was a great movie and it hads its flaws. it is  a straight up love letter to the old cannon and legends. however i found when i went with friends who do not know as much about SW as me they got lost. Especially in scenes where it took knowledge for granted and you were made except it. Even with my knowledge it still suprised me! i love this movie and it is a wonder full creation.","true":true}
