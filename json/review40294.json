Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is number 8 in the Star Wars saga. While I enjoyed this movie I couldn't help feel that the Star Wars saga has become formulaic and repetitious.  This movie \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" seems to have similarities to \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\,\\\" the third movie which was number 6 if you follow the Star Wars chronology.  Even George Lucas and Mark Hamill have noted that this last series Disney has changed the trajectory of the story and are not following what Lucas had originally intended.  Nonetheless it does have good characters and surprises.","true":true}
