Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Typical all visuals and no logic disney trash.  Every opportunity for the characters to connect with the audience is stifled by disney wedging another political agenda in.  The space battles needed a subject matter expert to make sense.  The high critic score for this movie makes me doubt the validity of rotten tomato scores.","true":true}
