Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been at every movie premier since The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi battle's it out with Episode 1 & 2 for second worst ever. The Force Awakens was great but this current episode\/chapter crashes and burns. It is like they found Lawerence Kasdan's evil twin to right this movie!! Jedi history is forgotten and Intergalactic force skyping is in full effect. All the male character's are presented as childish\\, incompetent\\, ignorant or evil !?! There is more attention give to campy funny scenes than actual  plot development. From out of no where Jedi Masters are obsolete and training is no longer needed and all Force skills come preloaded!?! Disney creates a Star Wars feminism movie with a dash of politics with the only thing missing was a bumbling Ray Romano. If the roles were reversed between male and females\\, outrage would ensue throughout the media. Example: A male General affectionately touching a unconscious female subordinate saying she's a keeper\\, lol! it would go Nuclear Viral! If you have a fond childhood memory's of Star Wars this one will put a dent in it for sure. Disney\/Commercialism\/Politics finally kills the Last Jedi. \\\"Han shot first!\\\"","true":true}
