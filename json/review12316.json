Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so glad I didn't listen to to the viewers on this site.  I loved this movie and almost didn't see it due to some viewers bad reviews.  IMO this is a great movie.  Its fun and definitely Star Wars.  It seems the cool new thing is being negative.  Don't be a sheep\\, see it for yourself\\, its truly is very good.","true":true}
