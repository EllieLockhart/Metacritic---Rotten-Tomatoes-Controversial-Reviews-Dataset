Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a bastardization of everything you grew up with. Luke's character is unexplained\\, Rey has no motivations\\, Finn and Rose are useless\\, and Poe's character arc is completely contradicted. Not even to mention the vast amount of questions set up by the previous movie that  go unanswered in this one. If you were wondering the answers to these questions you will only get middle fingers. The only good things are that Mark and Carrie are still great and the fx are visually stunning. But in the end I cannot recommend this film.","true":true}
