Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good: visuals\\, landscapes and effects are incredible. Bad: everything else. Too many characters to develop anyone character at all. The seemingly critical pair of characters to the story from TFA\\, at least in terms of plot relevancy\\, Snoke and Luke\\, both turn out to be worthless afterthoughts\\,. Rey and Kylo Ren's interactions play like something from a twilight movie. Nothing is explained: First Order can track through light speed\\, just because. They then have to follow the resistance at slow speed and wait for their gas to run out\\, just because. Snoke is Darth Sidious level powerful\\, just because. Who trained him? Where does he come from?

Why is this getting great reviews? Just because.","true":true}
