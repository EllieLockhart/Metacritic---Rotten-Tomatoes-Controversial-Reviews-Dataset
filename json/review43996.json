Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thrilling\\, with great focus on character instead of action scene after action scene. A subtler film\\, off the typical star wars track but with risks that ultimately make it more interesting. Amazing performances from all cast members. Star Wars fanboys are never happy though.","true":true}
