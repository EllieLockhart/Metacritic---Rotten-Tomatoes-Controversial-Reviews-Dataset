Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The pacing was terrible\\, there were too many plots happening at once\\, and the fight coreography was god aweful when compared to even the prequels.\\n\\nThe few good things I could say about it are cancelled out by the unfaithfulness and unnaturalness of the writers to the characters.","true":true}
