Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had low expectations after seeing a lot of the user reviews. But I honestly loved it. Maybe people thought that this was a betrayal of Luke's character\\, but he was always a conflicted person. Sometimes you have to just sit back and enjoy the show.","true":true}
