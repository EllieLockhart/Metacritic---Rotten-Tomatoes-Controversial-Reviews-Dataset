Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reviews must have been paid off. This was a terrible addition to the starwars franchise. I was both offended and baffled by their inability to make a single scene cohesive with the rest of the story.","true":true}
