Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was great. Excellent story\\, sound\\, and sight. I came in not wanting anything and came out loving almost everything. Minor things bothered me here and there\\, but no film is perfect. The Last Jedi gets a well deserved 4 1\/2 stars.","true":true}
