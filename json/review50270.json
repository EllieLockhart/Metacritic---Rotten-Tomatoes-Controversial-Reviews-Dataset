Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Average graphics of 20 years ago\\, blundering plots with no since of purpose except confusion.\\nThe acting was child like. The actors appeared as confused as the script.","true":true}
