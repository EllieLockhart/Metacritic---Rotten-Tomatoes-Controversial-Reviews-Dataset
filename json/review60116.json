Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Revenge is a great motivator\\, but is it worth it. This is a main theme throughout this game. The first half of it\\, was amazing. Visually stunning\\, fluid gameplay\\, visceral\\, and surreal. I was 100% engrossed through the first half. The second half.... How does that meme go? \\\" you had us in the first half\\\" lol. Honestly though\\, this hurts writing this. I loved the first game. All through the 1st half of this game\\, I was completely engrossed. Such disappointments in \\,story decisions and executions. Abby is a terrible character. We're we supposed to\\,feel\\,something for\\,her? All\\,I felt was let down. I get what they were going for...and it didn't work. For you it might. I would recommend it. If you are new to the series. Try it out. If you are\\, or were invested in the first one. Be warned. Disappointing man. Damn\u2026 Expand","true":true}
