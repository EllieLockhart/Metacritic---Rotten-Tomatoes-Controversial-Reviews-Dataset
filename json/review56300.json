Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WAR: The Last Jedi is not just a bad Star Wars film\\, it is a bad film PERIOD. Nonsensical Plot\\, Forgettable Characters\\, Untalented \\\"Actors\\\"\\, Garbage Story\\, Plot-Holes Everywhere\\, Anticlimactic Ending\\, Cringey Dialogue\\, and the WORST Mary-Sue Main Character I've ever seen. An abortion of a Star Wars movie. DO NOT waste your money on this movie. Disney has clearly bought and paid for the positive reviews from \\\"critics\\\"\\, because the OBVIOUS divide between viewers and critics is laughable. STAR WARS is now a GARBAGE franchise. Good Job Disney\\, you pandering A-Holes.","true":true}
