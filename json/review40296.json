Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is OK star wars\\, not better than EP7 I think\\, but fun! There is a moment where I was like ... what happened to that character we just met like 5 min ago and where is he now? And of course\\, really surprised how it ended in terms of who is left alive.","true":true}
