Loved the first game. One of my favorites of all time. I really tried to give a damn about Abby (whom you spend a good third or fourth of the game controlling). I tried to feel SOMETHING and I just didn\u2019t. And if I didn\u2019t have a prior connection to Ellie from the first game I wouldn\u2019t have cared about her at all in this one either. So many of the characters are just...nothing. Generically sad characters. The longer this game has sat with more it disappoints and annoys me. I am very much judging this by comparing it to the feelings the first game put me through. Longing\\, sadness\\, relief\\, love and hope. I\u2019m kinda a sucker for that stuff when it\u2019s done right. I really just didn\u2019t care about anything in this sequel. It\u2019s way too long and constantly interrupting itself. If beautiful visuals and some solid zombie horror sections are enough for you to forgive a oppressingly uninteresting cast of characters and a story that comes full circle and becomes completely pointless\\, I recommend this game. (Spoilers: it\u2019s not worth it). Really a shame.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
