Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson will forever be know as \\\"The Man that killed Star Wars\\\"\\nEnough of the butthurt fanboy diatribe from those of you that somehow liked this giant tird of a movie.\\n\\nI love Disney for the most part but they sure blew this one.  Sure it's making big bucks but it will come in at half a BILLION less worldwide than TFA.  And this was a movie that had Luke Skywalker back in a full role and also saw Carrie Fishers final performance.  The overall damage will be seen for years to come and will be catastrophic to their Star Wars brand.\\n\\nRian and crew crapped on all that is and was Star Wars.  We are all for a new direction for SW once the Skywalker saga is complete.  Well Rian and Disney\\, you shit the bed on this one.  The Skywalker saga is now ruined forever as is the magic that was Star Wars...R.I.P.","true":true}
