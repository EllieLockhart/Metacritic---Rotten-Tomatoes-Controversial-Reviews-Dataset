Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was kind of good and it was kind of bad. Left me flat. Seems to me you could have changed the characters names\\, called lightsabers laser swords like Luke did and had a standalone space movie with bad guys and good guys. This just didn't resonate. Worth 3 stars but that is about it.","true":true}
