Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi pushes the Star Wars series to a place it's never been. Unlike the Force Awakens\\, which played it safe to bring people back into the series\\, The Last Jedi takes risks that the series needed. Everyone who did not like this movie simply wants to see the old movies re-hashed over and over. The art\\, emotion\\, and power of this movie are second to none","true":true}
