Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Obviously this wasn't a perfect movie\\, specifically around the scene at the casino\\, but overall\\, this was a great movie. People need to understand that to make a great franchise that should last\\, you can't stick to one single theme over and over. I'm glad that they took risks and went off the typical star wars theme because if they did continue to follow that same star wars theme\\, the franchise would be slowly digging its grave.","true":true}
