Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero world building. In fact this was the opposite of word building\\, and the opposite of what Marvel has done. I don't care about the deaths\\, but transient characters you have no chance to learn or care about is a recipe for disaster in every movie. I have no idea how the critics rated this so highly.","true":true}
