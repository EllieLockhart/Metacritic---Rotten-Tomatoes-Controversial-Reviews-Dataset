Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong boring chase\\, wimpy Luke.  Many plot elements do not make sense in this trilogy.   Leia is a great general and leader but the first order has decimated the new republic under a leader that Kylo dispatched with the flick of a finger.  \\n\\nNext time\\, I wait for the DVD.","true":true}
