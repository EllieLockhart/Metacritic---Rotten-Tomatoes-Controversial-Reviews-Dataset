Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly can't see why there is so much hate on this one. The Last Jedi is easily the best Star Wars movie ever not including the New Hope. Maybe my expectations were low because of the Force Awakens but I don't know. The Praetorian guard scene on the Supremacy is easily one of the most intense scenes ever. The climax was also greatly executed. Also who couldn't love PORGS!!!!????\\n-8.5\/10","true":true}
