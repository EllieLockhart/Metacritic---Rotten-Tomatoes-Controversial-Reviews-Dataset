Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want my money back.\\nIt was bad. Dull and seemed that my favorite characters scope was reduced to not second character importance\\, but third.\\n\\nAlso\\, way too many plot holes or ridiculous statements (Snooke). A frustrating story to watch. It's sad to see our beloved universe turned so much for profit.","true":true}
