Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson didn't do his homework! \\n\\nNo lightsaber fight for the first time ever. \\n\\nRian Johnson has destroyed Luke Skywalker's character as he is now full of fear. Logically this should mean he's turning to the dark side but apparently not. \\n\\nMedicholrian spirits can now affect the physical world with immense power! Yet they don't help out with any of the fighting despite the light side being so outnumbered..? \\n\\nLeia does something only one properly trained in the force can do. \\n\\nRey is doing things that take years of Jedi school yet she doesn't even really get trained in the movie! \\n\\nBad guys killed off before even putting up a fight\\, BORING. \\n\\nAnd some acts of \\\"the force\\\" which have never been in the Star Wars universe and do not fit!","true":true}
