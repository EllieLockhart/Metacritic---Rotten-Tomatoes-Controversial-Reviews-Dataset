{"101487":106534,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At the core of the film\\, there's probably a good movie. But even the films shining moments are akin to attempting to stop arterial bleeding with a band-aid. This film may be the worst of the series and it's a shame because at times you can see the films potential shine through only to have it completely ruined moments after.\\n\\nHere's my honest attempt at reviewing a film I so desperately wanted to like and see do well but instead viewing it left me with an empty hollow feeling as I watched one of my favorite childhood franchises resurrected from the dead by an evil voodoo witch doctor named Disney who makes the decaying corpse of a franchise dance around to the pleasure of a group of children who are throwing money at the entire scene and applauding while taking to twitter on the phones and lauding the amount of \\\"diversity\\\" and \\\"hilaryous scenes\\\" in the film.\\n\\nTo begin\\, this movie is all over the place and that's because you're trying to follow not two or even three but FOUR SEPARATE PLOT STRANDS. They do converge at the end but this is terribly drawn out and fatiguing while also splitting your attention and interest all over the place. It seems that just as if it's about to get interesting with one strand you are following it cuts to another\\, and then another\\, and then back again. It makes it a pain\\, and although the story isn't necessarily confusing it's hard to care about the scale of it all.\\n\\nThen comes the comic relief (this is a big issue and as such will be devoting 2 paragraphs to this)\\, and before you crucify me\\, yes I do understand that comic relief has always been a part of Star Wars\\, but [excluding the prequels\\, although I daresay even they handled comic relief better] the other films didn't hit you over the head with it every 5 minutes. This was a bit of an issue in Episode 7\\, but if you thought the volume of jokes and cheesiness of them in that film was bad then hold onto your butts for Episode 8. Look I get it\\, Star Wars has always been a big hit with younger audiences\\, but what Disney and this new director seem to not understand is that it was a hit with ALL AUDIENCES\\, the jokes were clever\\, realistic\\, and were not cartoonishly stupid [excluding prequels as I mentioned before]. Do you think in the original trilogy Lucas was afraid of what specifically kids were gonna think when he saw this movie or wether they'd laugh or not\\, or how many toys they could make from all the funny little characters he could shove in? The answer is No. We see this downward spiral beginning with Jar Jar in Episode 1\\, and this is the culmination of that.\\n\\nIt's fine to have a bit of comic relief now and then\\, but it should be measured and the quality and practicality of the comedy should be taken into it's use. This film is not measured in it's use of comic relief\\, it starts with it right at the beginning and it's nonstop. Yes there are serious scenes in the film\\, but its paced horribly. It would be like watching the scene in a New Hope where Obi-Wan is showing Luke his father's light saber and 30 seconds later in that same scene a Jawa runs in and tries to steal R2-D2 or some stupid crap like that. If this film had 50% less of this unnecessary comic relief it would serve the much more serious tone this movie TRIED to take. There is one scene with BB-8 in particular that really jumps the shark and took me out of it for a moment due to it's sheer stupidity. In the end\\, it seems like this overzealous amount of comic relief probably boiled down to some people in a board room trying to see how many toys they could make from all the funny animals and scenes they put in this movie.\\n\\nCharacters\\, Characters\\, Characters\\, a big problem is the characters. Some I literally do not care about one bit in this film\\, and the characters that I did think were interesting or worthy of further development were killed or they have very limited screen time. [Slight spoilers ahead]. For anyone looking for any answers about Snoke you will not find them in this film. If anyone was looking forward to Benicio Del Toro being in the movie\\, he literally is in the film for like 10 minutes\\, although he probably will be in Episode 9. The film also tries to add in a new major character who seems more like a diversity hire (in an already diverse enough movie) than a character they originally planned on having in the script. Some may try to draw comparisons to Lando with his introduction in Episode 5 but that would be a disservice to Lando because he was actually interesting because he further established a main character's backstory (Han's) while also having Charisma. This new character on the other hand I couldn't care less about\\, and her only tie to the story is that her sister dies at the beginning (who is also a character who is not established nor has any real reason for you to be invested in her). Another new character is also introduced and she is summarily killed off\\, and again she screams of a diversity hire while also being completely pointless and I felt no emotional reaction when she died (besides slight happiness). Speaking of Diversity Hires\\, you're in for a treat if you think they were gonna expand on Captain Phasma at all. Yoda also makes an appearance (as a force ghost of course)\\, and if there wasn't so many other crappy characters it may not have been as bad\\, but ultimately it feels like a cheap nostalgia cash-in. The main characters hold up (besides the aforementioned new one)\\, but Damn if there isn't a lot of them now. I will say Adam Driver actually did a good job in this film and stands out in comparison to the rest. The writing at times is just atrocious as well\\, but this ties into some of my other points.\\n\\nI mentioned diversity hires in the last section\\, and this leads me to my next point. This film is dripping with political messaging\\, and while you could say this is just me being paranoid as a right-winger\\, the media is eating this up\\, and other sources affiliated with the film seem to acknowledge this. Just like Harry Potter\\, and the Hunger Games\\, and Doctor Who\\, it seems now that even Star Wars is not safe from being used as a \\\"rallying cry\\\" for \\\"diversity\\\" and bringing down the left's worst enemy \\\"mean old Donald Drumpf and the rayciss white peepol\\\". The way they talked about the power of \\\"Hope\\\" and \\\"the resistance\\\" was unabashedly stroking the ego of all the childlike liberals who see themselves as the hero in [insert franchise name here\\, including Star Wars now I guess]\\, fighting mean old Drumpf. There's also a part where they try to make an argument about arms dealing and animal cruelty\\, which I get are bad things but I don't really go to see Star Wars to get preached at.\\n\\nSo those are my main gripes\\, and it's truly sad these listed grievances really destroy any potential the film had. Some of the plot points are really good\\, and there are some really great scenes (that still cant shake off the unnecessary comedy). My two favorite characters had to be Snoke and Kylo Ren\\, with Luke coming in at 3rd. There obviously was a decent framework at one point\\, but by the time the people in boardrooms looking at charts and holding meetings on \\\"the value of diversity and inclusivity\\\" had added their input it was all but lost. This movie was mediocre at best\\, and I would suggest watching this on DVD rental and not in the theater\\, as this might be something you can deal with watching better in the comfort of your own home and where you have the power to pause the movie\\, get up\\, and walk out.","true":true}
