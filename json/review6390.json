Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney ruined Star Wars. I tried to watch the originals when I got home to get the bad taste out of my mouth. I had to turn off the movie. Once I saw Luke\\, I saw the whiney sissy Disney created.","true":true}
