Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What Rian Johnson did with the character of Luke Skywalker was a travesty.  First he destroyed Luke through character assassination\\, then needlessly killed him off after bi-locating across the galaxy.  He presents Luke as a bitter old man\\, not the beacon of hope we have known in the past.  This was a huge disappointment for me so much so that I do not plan on seeing episode 9.  Nor do I plan on watching any more movies associated with Rian Johnson.","true":true}
