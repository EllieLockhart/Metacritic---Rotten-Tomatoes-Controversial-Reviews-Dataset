Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a great film. Many negative audience reviews coming from people who want to feel smart\\, spoiled and feel they somehow deserve more from a part 8. This film had me at the edge of my seat and many scene and character decisions were not predictable. Laura Dern (Jurassic Park) gave quite the emotional roller coaster ride\\, we didn't know what she was up to. Kelly Marie Tran (XOXO) has some intense and even cheesy lines but was a great addition to a cast lead by Daisy Ridley (The Murder On The Orient Express\\, Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Great to see Mark Hamill (Original Star Wars Trilogy) as always with a beautiful performance and farewell to the gorgeous Carrie Fisher (Original Star Wars Trilogy). I can't wait to see this again. Five stars. ?? ????????","true":true}
