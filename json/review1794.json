Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars movie\\,  this was just bad.  You really could take out 3\/4 of the movie and it would make no difference. It seems the director wanted to make cheap jokes and ignore making A  coherent movie.  Forget about the past star wars characters they have been reduced to whiny losers. The New Characters\\,  well everyone of them Is a Whiny loser too. I mean you build up Snoke\\,  Kylo Ren\\, Hux\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, And even Rey and Introduce Rose\\, guess what...they are ALL losers. These were not Anti-Hero\\, they all just suck. This has been compared to the Empire strikes back\\, and i can see some similarities.  But\\, there are so many character and the director had me rooting for them ALL to die\\, except the two who did.  Snoke seemed like the true bad guy\\, not Kylo-Ren\\, and Luke 's redemption was weak at best.\\nHow bad is this movie?  It ranks right there with episode 1 and 2\\, the director even gave us a race and kids that can't act.","true":true}
