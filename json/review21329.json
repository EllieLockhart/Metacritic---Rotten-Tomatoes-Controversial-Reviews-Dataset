Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to the European premiere dammit! At the Albert Hall! I talked to Daisy Ridley and that woman from Jurassic Park but fark me if I wasn't feeling superior the whole damn time. \\\"You idiots! You wasted Millions of dollars\\, thousands of people's time and a boat load of expensive catering for this?\\\" During the film\\, I found myself wandering the corridors of the Albert Hall\\, muttering \\\"It's the death of Star Wars\\\" under my breath as the treble filtered sounds of this absolute steaming pile wafted through to me via each balcony I passed. The worst thing it was was unfunny where they'd tried to be. Seriously? Comedy? In a Star Wars film? Did you not know about JAR JAR FARKIN' BINKS?! It's like all these people\\, so called captains of their industry are just children\\, walking around with monkeys playing cymbals in their brains as they try to pass off being grown ups to other moronic children with lots of money. I DO S*&%S WITH MORE ARTISTRY THAN THIS. Twats.","true":true}
