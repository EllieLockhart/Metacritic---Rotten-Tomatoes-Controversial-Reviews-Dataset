Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was just okay. Too many subplots that were completely pointless and boring (I'm looking at you casino scene). There were also scenes that were borderline weird (creepy milk\/boob scene). The battle at the end was cool\\, visually nice\\, but then just ended with Rey.....vanishing?! Where'd she go? How'd she get back to the shop with Chewbacca?!? I feel like it was good enough for someone who's just a mediocre Star Wars fan.","true":true}
