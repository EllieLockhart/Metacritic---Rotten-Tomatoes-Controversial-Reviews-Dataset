Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie and I hate Rian Johnson for ruining Star Wars. Star Wars is about Good vs. Evil. Rian Johnson blurred those lines and needlessly destroyed every amazing storyline set forth by JJ. If I ever have the opportunity\\, I would punch Rian right in the nose.","true":true}
