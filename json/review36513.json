Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie did not deserve 5 starts but I wanted to offset the whiny babies who hated the movie because it didn't live up to the movie they had in their head.\\n\\nThe movie had its issues but nothing more than any other movie.  I thought it was a great continuation with one movie left to play out.","true":true}
