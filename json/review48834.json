Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst one yet. Can't watch this movie a second time. Tried but I turned it off. Every other Star Wars movie I've watched 1000's times. Including force awakens and Rogue. But this movie sucks","true":true}
