Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is destroying everything about the Star Wars in 152 minutes. All the legendary characters\\, Force\\, Jedi\\, Dark Side etc. everything else is destroyed. There is no word to say\\, cause there's nothing in your hands when you get out of the theater. Director Rian Johnson takes Star Wars and throws it in a big hole.","true":true}
