Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This did not have the spirit of a Space Epic not a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. Minor spoilers: No cool new aliens (everyone who matters is a human or a droid or dies)\\, no \u201cSpace\u201d (bombs \u201cdrop\u201d even without gravity; If you run out of fuel in space you slow down; every ship has the same speed except the Millennium Falcon... )\\, the big bad villain was just \u201cthere;\u201d it wasn\u2019t really a war (when you see the numbers remaining\\, it\u2019s like a skirmish \/ OJ Simpson car chase). If you like seeing people \u201cwake up\u201d then this movie is for you\\, as just about everyone gets knocked out and wakes up before a pivotal moment: Drama! Sigh. I guess Star Wars really is over.","true":true}
