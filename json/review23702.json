Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke gets handed lightsaber throws it over his shoulder as if a joke \\,not on ground in disgust \\,he doesn't walk away from Rey handing it to him as if not interested\\, but over his shoulder\\, this moment could have been so many things but to make it a joke was just wrong so so very wrong. \\nRey is not a Skywalker or Solo? After all the things from the other movie hinting she was you make her random\\, so much for feeling a connection to a character. Snoke not explained\\, so big so powerful and poof just killed. I didn't think Yoda could ever truly be bad but somehow they made his scene just weird. Bad jokes through entire movie. Luke \\,dear dear Luke \\,deserved so much better. Whole family walked out of theater going what did we just watch. Next Star Wars movie will be the first one I don't see in a theater will not waste time or money.","true":true}
