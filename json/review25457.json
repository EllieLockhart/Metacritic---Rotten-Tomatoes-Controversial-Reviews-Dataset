Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No point to Rey\\, No Point to Snoke\\, no Point to luke. Horrible story telling and ignores all previous films. It was a Star Wars film because I had Lazer swords and blasters and a thing called the force but that\u2019s it","true":true}
