Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the movie was over I looked over to my 9 year old son and asked him how he liked it...and he looked at me and said that sucked. This was a very bad movie how they treated Luke was just wrong....","true":true}
