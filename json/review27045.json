Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the better Star Wars films to date. Definitely in my top 5. It went in directions that were completely unexpected and left me eagerly anticipating where it would go from here. To be fair\\, I find myself wanting to see this again because there was so much to take in\\, I feel I missed things\\, but hopefully nothing too important.","true":true}
