Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was barely watchable\\, let alone something that furthered the story line of any character other than Kylo Ren.  Hollywood wonders why moviegoer turnout has been on a steady decline the last few years and this movie is a perfect example why.   Confusing\\,  pointless plot\\, just an utter waste of time.","true":true}
