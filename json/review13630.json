Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If expanding the Star Wars Universe was the goal\\, then The Last Jedi succeeded with aplomb.  I was disappointed in what I thought was going to happen\\, and confused in other spots\\, but that's a good\\, not a bad thing.  A very fun movie that is going to tick off a lot of fanboys and their \\\"only male Jedi's have latitude to do that new Force type stuff!\\\" attitudes.","true":true}
