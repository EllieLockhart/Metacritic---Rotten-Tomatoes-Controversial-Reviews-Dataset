Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just disappointing... bad humor\\, Luke doesn't have a true lightsaber duel\\, not enough touchstones. comments about fan outrage being because the writer\/Disney didn't give \\\"fan service\\\" to fandom a cop out... It was just a bad movie. Time to admit it. Disney needs to get a real writer.","true":true}
