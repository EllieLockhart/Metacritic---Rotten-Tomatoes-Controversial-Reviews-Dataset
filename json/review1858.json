Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As has been said many times\\, this was a big middle finger to those who love Star Wars and those who have been involved in creating and building everything we love about it. No idea how J.J. Abrams is going to fix this mess\\, since there's nothing left to fix and we can not forget seeing this abomination. #JJAbrams #ouronlyhope","true":true}
