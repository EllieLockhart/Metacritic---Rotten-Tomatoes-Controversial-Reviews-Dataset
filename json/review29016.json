Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really feels like poorly written fan fiction. It's almost as if Rian Johnson watched like 5 episodes of battlestar galactica and suddenly said I got this. Luke not being luke at all is only part of it. Slow motion chase\\, casino nonsense\\, space ghost leia\\, how it ruins leia by making her out to be a horrible leader who gets everyone killed except a handful of people on the falcon.","true":true}
