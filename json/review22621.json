Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lifelong SW's fan\\, original came out on my 13th bday\\, was in *love* with Luke Skywalker...TLJ brought him from almost too-good-to-be-true\\, teen heartthrob hero to a *true* legend who experienced the entire range of very identifiable human emotion. Loved the farmboy from Tatooine even more after he force-projected across the galaxy to say good-bye to his sister and *try* to salvage her broken son. Dont understand how anyone could see his last stand as anything less than totally badassed. Opinions from a very vocal group notwithstanding\\, TLJ gave me the fan experience (40 years later) that I had as that gobsmacked 13 year old watching Star Wars (it will never be \\\"A New Hope\\\" to me) in the summer of '77.","true":true}
