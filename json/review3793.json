Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beyond terrible - had to keep myself from going to sleep by repeatedly telling myself that eventually the movie would be good\\, then the credits came up. Thanks Disney for wasting my time with this garbage - who in the world green-lighted this script\/finish product. Plenty of people need to be fired and replaced with real storytellers\/film makers.","true":true}
