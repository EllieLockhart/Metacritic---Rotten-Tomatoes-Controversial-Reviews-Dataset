Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"watched it together with my gf which is not a SW fan and therefore gave an unbiased opinion. She found it very boring\\, to the point she started looking at her phone after one hour. My opinion as a SW fan is even worse... it's a petty such a good cast of actors were given such a terrible script. Apart from being boring\\, the plot is stupid to say the least even for a 5-y old approaching the series for the first time. If Disney is so sure that killing all of the old characters gives the series a fresh start\\, why don't they apply the same thinking to their original characters and chop Mickey Mouse's head off? :)","true":true}
