Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe these audience reviews. I am a lifelong fanatic and absolutely loved it\\, as did everyone else in the theater! God\\, you make one move against the man who made those horrendous prequels and look out--it's terrible! You guys are nuts.","true":true}
