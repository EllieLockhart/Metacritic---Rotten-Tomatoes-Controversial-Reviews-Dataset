Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've really struggled with how I feel about this film. Here is a review that absolutely best captures the fact that while I enjoyed the movie I was disappointed on a lot of levels\\, by how disjointed it was with everything that came before. It was a good film just not a great Star Wars movie.\\nhttps:\/\/screenrant.com\/star-wars-8-last-jedi-disappointing\/2\/","true":true}
