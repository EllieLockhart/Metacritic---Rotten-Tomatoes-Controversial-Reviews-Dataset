Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seeing Luke brought so low was very\\, very difficult.  But the high of actually SEEING Luke\\, helped (somewhat)\\, to balance that out.  That said\\, he's the only one I want to see.  Everything else Rian (who spells Ryan this way?  A TWAT) wrote was absolute garbage.  It is clear that Rian's alter-ego is a purple-haired\\, vegan feminist-- she took over during the entire re-writing of the Star Wars Universe.  Star Wars is a trilogy.  There are exactly three films.  Episodes IV\\, V\\, and VI.  Enjoy those :)  from the 70s and 80s.  Star Wars in 2017 is a political piece of propaganda and dead.","true":true}
