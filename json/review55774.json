Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People giving a fresh review are suffering from the same delusion that happened for the Phantom Menace. TPM had a much better lightsaber fight just to start. In this movie there is a 20-30 min portion that is pointless overall. New characters are introduced that I literally felt nothing for. There is one space battle with basically one xwing. The rebellions storyline is so weak and full of massive plot holes that \\\"How it should have ended\\\" will have a field day. This movie just fell completely flat. TFA was better for me in every way. This movie is currently 40% by fan rating for a damn good reason.","true":true}
