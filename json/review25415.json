Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Non spoiler review. One word\\, Satisfying. How can one be original in the Star Wars universe? This movie achieves originality while deftly utilizing classic SW tropes. Is it humorous? Yes most definitely. Does it try too hard like Jar Jar in Ep 1.? No. Does it have flaws? Of course\\, but none that are movie breaking. My only non-spoilery gripe is that there is a B story during the second act that is inconsistent in pacing. But that might be and editorial miscalculation\\, after all this movie has been in the can for several months. Overall\\, I think this is going to be a polarizing film for some fans\\, but I enjoyed it.","true":true}
