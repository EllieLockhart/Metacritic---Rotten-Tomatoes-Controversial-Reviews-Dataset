{"40636":"Im gonna write this review based on the story with no spoilers. And just to make clear I had no problem with the genders and sexual preferences from the characters in this game as I believe a lot of people are saying that this is the reason they didn't like the game which is complete rubbish. The problem with the story it takes away what you loved about the 1st game and forces you to player as a character you despise so as a player you become dis interested in the 2nd half of the game. The gameplay elements were fun but the story made me rush to completion as I simply became disengaged. There are character choices that are really out of character and I really believe they have killed this franchise. The marketing for the game was very misleading and the developers have the arrogance to think they can emotionally manipulate you with such negativity and then sympathise. I know there were elements like that in the 1st game but it never felt hostile. They cant fix what they have done and the writers at naughty dog seriously need to be reviewed as this story is very amateur. If Bruce Straley  was apart of this project we may have got a better story. I really wish this game wasn't made. What a waste. The character Abby can go f herself and so can naughty dog with there **** crunch culture. But well done on delivering your torture porn game if that was your goal\u2026 Expand","TLOU2":"true","2020-08-05":null,"10":null,"The Last of Us 2 represents how games should be made.
