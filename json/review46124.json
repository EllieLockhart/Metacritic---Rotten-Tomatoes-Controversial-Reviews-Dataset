Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals and audio top notch. But the problems make this almost unwatchable: Plot holes and logical problems everywhere; bad treatment of Luke Skywalker; boring and bland new characters; Rey has god mode; contrived plot and conveniences that break the rules of the world just to have certain cool looking scenes. This one even breaks the lore retroactively for the films before; the humor does not work for me; even the most serious situation is treated like a joke. Feels more like Spaceballs than Star Wars. This one broke Star Wars for me. Not going to see another one or buy the merch. I really wanted to like this but instead it feels like a slap in the face of the fans. The only way to salvage this would be to have Finn wake up in the medbay next episode and declare it a bad dream. I wish them good luck in fixing this mess.","true":true}
