Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will say the same thing about this movie (and the Force Awakens) as I would about the prequels... they would have been better sans the original trilogy.  You cannot capture lightning in a bottle twice.  I would give this more stars\\, but it is always being compared to the originals\\, and found lacking.\\nLuke was kinda whiney\\, but he was in the originals too\\, and he never actually WON a light saber duel - he kinda whined his way to victory in Episode 6.\\nThere were TONS of plot holes and continuity problems - but again\\, same in the originals.  Useless add on characters?  Check.  Same in originals.\\nThe whole movie kind of felt heavy and extraneous\\, like they were trying really hard to make the retread thicker - kind of how the AT-ATs were the same but BIGGER HEAVIER DARKER.  There were some attempts at humor - but seriously?  'Your mama' jokes?  Oddly I think this movie fails for the OPPOSITE reason Phantom Menace did - PM was TOO light and goofy and I think fans of the originals felt they weren't being serious ENOUGH. \\nSome of the ex-machina stuff was just way too over the top - I was rooting for Leia to bite it in the space battle - it would have been consistent with the theme of killing off the old cast to make way for the new\\, and appropriate given Fischer's situation - but no - she Forces her way back to the ship for whatever purpose\\, because she didn't really add any more to the story.  Finn should have been sucked into the cannon - I KNEW he wouldn't but was trying to guess how they were going to save him - and then Rose blah blah whatever. Lame.\\nThe PC stuff was painful to watch as they checked all the boxes\\, but at least it wasn't hamfisted and there were only a couple of stupid speeches.\\nThe visuals were excellent of course\\, and it wasn't a total loss of a movie\\, but 7-9 would be far better as a standalone trilogy.","true":true}
