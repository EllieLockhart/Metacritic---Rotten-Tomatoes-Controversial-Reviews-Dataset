Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a lot wrong with this movie. The plot holes\\, story lines that go nowhere\\, and death of what could have been interesting avenues to pursue story wise. If this movie was not star wars related\\, people would have critiqued it harder\\, but it's kind of like where everyone is trying to not be that person that tells when something popular is actually bad so that everyone goes in pretend mode. Even in the theater there was a scene that was kind of cringe worthy but one guy started clapping and cheering so everyone joins in after the awkward silence.","true":true}
