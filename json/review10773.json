Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the best Star Wars movie to date. Biased original trilogy fans disagree but they either don't want anything new in the films because it ruins the 'magic' or they don't want it to be the same as the other films. From start to finish it flows and answers a few questions but not too many. It leaves us with even more questions for Episode IX and pays homage to original trilogy fans with a few scenes. Action and a pinch of comedy to keep it lighthearted was amazing. Am definitely going to watch it again.","true":true}
