Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has decided to no longer stay true to our characters' histories and characters. They want to shatter their personalities and from the shards\\, build a character that fits their personal wants and views. It's a shame George Lucas had to sell it to such a crooked company. They care not for the fan base other than to tease them along for what could be then go in the opposite direction.  This movie does indeed inspire hope however\\, that maybe JJ will correct and right the damage that has been done. Some people waited 40 years to see what Luke had culminated to and how well he developed as a being and \\\"legends\\\" gave them that. Disney gave the worst tease last year for his character and for redemption in this film they've wronged not only Luke but the fan base themselves. Truly pitiful","true":true}
