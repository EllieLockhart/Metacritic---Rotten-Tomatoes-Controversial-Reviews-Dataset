Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a complete bust!\\n\\nSPOILER TO FOLLOW: \\n\\nthey spend the entire movie running from the first order\\, the princess can now survive in cold dark space\\, Jedis' can now project himself on a planet light years away\\, and what's with the giant ships that the first order \\\"magically\\\" just happened to have stashed away somewhere? And then there's the whole part about Poe having to escape the first order\\, fly to a random planet\\, find a random guy in a random casino to try to get away from the first order... and all the while the rebellion is just trying not to run out of fuel? That's it? Seriously? Worst of the series so far.","true":true}
