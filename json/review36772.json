Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie seemed like a repeat of 5 and a little of 6. Ben Solo is like a young anakin. You learned nothing about  the Sith Lord and ben's master. Leia being able to so fluently use the force despite not being trained in it. Every character was a comic relief character and it dragged in a lot of places throughout the movie. I would have given this movie 0 stars if I could have.","true":true}
