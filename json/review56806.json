Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people who made this movie seem to have no understanding of what made Star Wars so great... This movie is s mediocre sci fi action film (great visuals though) and a terrible star wars film. \\n\\n* SPOILERS *\\nIt seems Luke Skywalker\\, the man who risked his life to try and find good in his mass murderer father\\, who cut of his hand in the last battle is now willing to kill\\, his own nephew his student\\, just because he feels evil inside. \\nAnd why is there evil inside Kylo\\, with Anakin there was an explanation... He was drawn to the dark side while trying to save his wife's life. \\nHere? No explanation. \\nI can go on and on ranting\\, about the major holes in the story\\, about complete break of Star Wars universe rules. \\nBut even as an action film this movie fails to deliver any reason or sense to the situations described. \\nDropping gravity bombs in space?\\nA complete irrelevant side story for Finn and Rose?\\nLuke the strongest warrior in the galaxy\\, sacrifices himself to save a group of 10 rebels\\, instead of going to fight his student who he obviously can defeat?\\nIf Disney wanted to launch something new\\, they could have just set the stories centuries later and left the old characters alone.","true":true}
