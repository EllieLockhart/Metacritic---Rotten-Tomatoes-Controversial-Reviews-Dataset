Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible instalment for Star Wars fans!\\nBad character development\\, including throw away characters (i.e. Holdo\\, Snoke\\, Tallie\\, dj)\\nTerrible end for Admiral Ackbar.\\nRose was a terrible character with no gravitas.\\nRey has no clear character drive\\, it teased her flirting with the dark side whilst with luke\\, but has no further repercussions.\\nvery disappointing that they killed luke off (yes I know he can return as a force ghost)\\, but given that carrie fisher had passed away prior to the films release it would have made some sense to have kept luke alive\\, possibly had rey staying with Kylo Ren in an attempt to soften him...\\n\\nThere was so much potential for this film\\, but they just seem to have taken too much of a chance and ruined this for many of the older fans.\\nwhat is sadder is their lack of caring for this and a complete disregard for any constructive criticism!","true":true}
