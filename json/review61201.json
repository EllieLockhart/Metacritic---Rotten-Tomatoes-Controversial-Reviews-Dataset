Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'll be honest\\, I wasn't expecting much. Many people loved the first one\\, and all too often\\, a sequel just shows that fans and developers aren't on the same page. That's okay. The gameplay loop is great\\, the graphics are great and the level design is fantastic. The AI is simply good\\, the story is serviceable\\, and some of the characterizations of some of the people provide an empathetic connection.\r\rHowever\\, this game makes me sick. The overly gratuitous sex scene is one thing that I may not have appreciated\\, but then\\, at times\\, relentless over the top goreplay is too much. Now that I've gone all the way through\\, I will simply say that this was a torture porn and gore show. The story\\, while not bad\\, does nothing to deserve the torture and outright evil things you do as Abby.\r\rI like the first game\\, wouldn't call myself a fan\\, but it was fine enough. This game tried to play the \\\"art\\\" game\\, but it's really just a case of somebody getting off on what should be an AO rating.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
