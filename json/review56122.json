Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Speaking as someone who enjoyed the prequels as a child and adores the original trilogy *Han Shot First*\\, I thoroughly enjoyed the recent renditions of the Force Awakens and Rogue One and hotly anticipated this latest film. However\\, having said that\\, I was extremely disappointed with The Last Jedi. Plagued by poor cinematography\\, dialogue\\, acting\\, character development\\, writing\\, and not to mention an understanding of basic physics\\, to put it quite simply this film was hot garbage. I could not watch this film without cringing regularly and my arm grew tired of face palming after one of my past favorite characters was forced to belt out some poorly written\\, humorless\\, and awkward dialogue. The only redeeming part was Yoda showing up. Then there are the political implications to this film that I had an issue with\\, with its anti-war innuendos being forced down audiences throats \\\"Its all a machine man\\, don't join it\\\". I'm not going to even get into the surreal childlike understanding of military law- just so you know\\, mutinies are usually punished with Life in prison\/executions\\, not \\\"Oh shucks that flyboy is at it again\\\". I thought Disney was onto something after the gritty realism that was offered in Rogue One; clearly that is not the case. That anybody honestly enjoyed this film baffles me\\, I felt like I was taking crazy pills after walking out of the midnight release. That this film has a 93% on RT tells me that Top Critics are either incredibly detached from Audiences\\, or paid off by Disney. In short\\,  I hated this film. It was a cash grab that left me wanting my money back. 10\/10 do not recommend. Please strike this film from the record.","true":true}
