Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely *loved* it this time; the first time was great\\, the second time was even better. Without all the shock and awe\\, I was able to sit back and just enjoy it. I've always felt Star Wars just becomes all the more enjoyable when you're familiar with it\\, probably since many of us spent so many years watching the OT we can hardly remember seeing them for the first time\\, they were just always there in our lives. I thought maybe it was a tad too funny the first time (not that the humour was bad\\, just perhaps too much of it)\\, the second time however all the humour felt very much part of the movie and classic Star Wars.","true":true}
