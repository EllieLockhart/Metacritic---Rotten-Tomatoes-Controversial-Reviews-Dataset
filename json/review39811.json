Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a piece of trash\\, that somehow got greenlit\\, and filmed. It seems as if nobody even bothered to read the script\\, or just didn't care. Pretty visuals mean nothing if your story breaks established lore\\, isn't funny\\, forces humor\\, deletes lightsabers to 'save' a hero\\, and destroys a major infuential character\\, not only in the movies\\, but also in rea life.","true":true}
