Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This did not feel like star wars at all. Between the way it was shot and the way it was written. Full of plenty predictable and cliche moments that leave you wondering if Riam Johnson was trying to end his career on the worst most expensive disaster to date. The fact Justice league has a higher audience score says a lot. Being a die hard fan of both star wars and dc I can't believe I would choose the bigger disappointment over Star Wars. Everything with character deaths to how characters exited the series was just so melodramatic and poorly executed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI can't believe how much Disney is ruining movies just to cash in quick. Fuck you riam and screw you disney","true":true}
