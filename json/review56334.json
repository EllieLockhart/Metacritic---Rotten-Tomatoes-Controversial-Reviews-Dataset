Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SWTLJ was a spectacular movie that kept audiences on the edge o their seats awaiting every climactic moment and every action scene. Some may be disappointed because they think this movie is too \u201cgoofy\u201d or \u201cthey are trying too hard to be funny\u201d\\, but I thought the humor was well executed and so did the full theater of people who got to experience this movie with me. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: Some people are just giving the movie a bad rating because Rey and Kylo Ren supposedly are not brother and sister\\, but supreme leader Snoke put thoughts in their heads to draw them to each other\\, so when Kylo Ren told Rey that her parents were just nobodies\\, that is most likely Snokes words put into their heads. That\u2019s just my opinion on what I think happened though. Overall it was a good movie and kept me interested the whole way through and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to put the Star Wars franchise into a 21st century appeal\\, while still keeping what made the originals great.
