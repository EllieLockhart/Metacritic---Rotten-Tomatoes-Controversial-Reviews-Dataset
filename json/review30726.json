Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Skywalkers portrayal in this installment was shameful.  Even Hamill said he felt as if the character shouldn't have even been called Luke.  Considered the most powerful Jedi in Star Wars Canon was turned into a joke.  The Yoda cameo was moronic. The ship on ship main plot was ridiculous and the side stories quite silly and nonsensical.  Sorry\\, this was trash.","true":true}
