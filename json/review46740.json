Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Welcome to the strangest of all Star Wars movies: a film that ends where it begins; a film that teases bold change but only delivers a cosmetic touch-up here and there; a film of ravishing but empty style; a film written by a fan too respecting in the end to go beyond the bedroom of his thoughts; a film of bluffs and winks and slight of hand that makes you yearn for the story that was hiding there\\, somewhere.","true":true}
