Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is problematic and fairly hollow. Once the glamour and sheer entertainment factor wears off\\, we're left with an underwhelming\\, strange\\, and often disjointed mess. For me\\, ultimately\\, there are just too many overwhelming flaws to ignore. In my opinion\\, characterization is flat and rushed\\, questions are answered cheaply and haphazardly\\, little is done in terms of scope and imagination\\, and it feels completely different (perhaps even defiantly cut off) from the rest of the films in the franchise. For me\\, I can't let the disappointments and mistakes of this movie go. A bad movie shouldn't get a pass simply because its belongs to such an established series.","true":true}
