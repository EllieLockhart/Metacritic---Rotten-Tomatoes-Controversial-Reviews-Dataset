Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Prepare yourself for a hyperspace kamikaze barrage of fan boy logic expos\\, but The Last Jedi realizes it is only a vessel for a story that transcends a franchise of action figures.
