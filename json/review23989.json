Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many people have posted reviews on this... so I won't waste my breath here. I had low expectations going in\\, and left very disappointed. Frankly\\, it's a hot mess as a movie\\, and I'm speaking not as a huge fan of Star Wars. It's visually beautiful\\, but the plot is like Swiss cheese. I fell asleep a couple of times. Leia's \\\"Space Mary Poppins\\\" moment was cringe-inducing.","true":true}
