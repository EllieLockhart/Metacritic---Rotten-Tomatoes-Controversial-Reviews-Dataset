Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At least the shitty Lucas movies were coherent and not a complete mess.\\nRose was enough to ruin the entire movie and was a complete waste of time and space in this movie.\\nHalf of the movie should have bin thrown in the in the trash and the people who wrote this pice of sh..it should be fired.\\nHalf of the movie was a complete waste of time\\, the hole Casino part was so bad I was about to turn of the TV. \\n\\nThe end ruins the whole Star Wars universe\\, so why didn't they fly through the DeathStar in hyper space? Or build missiles with hyper space capability? \\n\\nMy verdict: wouldn't even download for free\\nNot even worth the space on my HDD\\, a complete waste of zeros and ones. ","true":true}
