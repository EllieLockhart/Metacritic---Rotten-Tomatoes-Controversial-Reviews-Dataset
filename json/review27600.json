Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over disneyfied\\, terrible plot\\, no character development what so ever\\, characters are removed after so many questions are left unanswered\\, and it's filled with joke after joke giving it a not so Star Wars to it but more of a guardians of the galaxy 3 feel. So much injustice done to the character of Luke Skywalker and the legacy of Star Wars. This movie gives me no hope for the ninth installment.","true":true}
