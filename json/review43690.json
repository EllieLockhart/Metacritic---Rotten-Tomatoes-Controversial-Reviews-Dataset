Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was terrible - I have been a major Star Wars fan all my life - the issue is not about the changes or the new characters - it's just a horrible story with shitty plot lines that don't make sense. Also a lack of answers for multiple characters (snoake and Rey for example) was extremely frustrating - they made us ask the questions in the force awakens - they introduced the characters gave us mystery behind them then gave the most pathetic cop out - or even better don't even answer the question and kill off the character. It is very worrying that Disney is hiring the same director to do more movies. The issue with the movie is not about not following the stars wars mythology or that \\\"its not what fan boys want\\\" it is literally just a poorly done movie. I will not be seeing any of the movies that Rian Johnson directs as to be blunt he is incompetent.","true":true}
