Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll never stop thinking that JJ. Abram should have directed this movie. WTF did Ryan Johnson do?! Why did he try to \\\"let the past die\\\" if at the end\\, everything occurred as every other Star Wars movie. I think it would have been great if Rey turned to the dark side side with Kylo Ren\\, that would have been mind-blowing\\, but it didn't happen\\, Rey went to the light because you know\\, she is a Jedi and that's what Jedi do. It's so stupid trying to do something but don't do it completely.\\nWhy the f**k didn't we see who Snoke was\\, I feel like Ryan didn't watch The Force Awakens\\, he went and did what he wanted without caring about anything that happened before.\\nI think this movie beats some of the precuels just because it has some good special effects and a great cast\\, those are the things that save it from being a total disaster.\\nWhy the hell would you put the FUEL as an important problem of the story\\, WHY?!\\nI hate this movie so much\\, I hate it because it could have been waaaaay better if someone else directed it (ehem... JJ... ehem)","true":true}
