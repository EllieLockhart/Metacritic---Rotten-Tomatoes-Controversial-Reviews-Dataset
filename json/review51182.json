Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it. Did not expect the direction that Johnson would take it\\, but I appreciated his fresh new take on the franchise. All of the actors are at the top of their game here\\, and the writing is phenomenal. What a fantastic send-off for Carrie Fisher. I'm ecstatic to see where Star Wars takes us next.","true":true}
