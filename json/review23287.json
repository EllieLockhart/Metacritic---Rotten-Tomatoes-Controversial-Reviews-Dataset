Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Maybe not quite as good as the original trilogy\\, but close. Leagues better than the prequels\\, but that\u2019s not difficult. Just as good as The Force Awakens. Ryan Johnson does an amazing job of turning a formulaic arc into an unpredictable resolution. That\u2019s something George Lucas was never able to accomplish\\, or never cared to. This seems to have angered fans who want Star Wars to keep following basic hero formulas that they can relate to. However\\, for someone who is tired of the old groove Hollywood seems to be stuck in with hero worshiping blood lines and making heroes unrealistically pure\\, it\u2019s a fresh and thrilling infusion of new energy.
