Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am saddened by the direction the franchise has gone. It now has more in common with Transformers than it does with the original Star Wars. Too many plot holes and inconsistencies\\, they haven't answered any of the questions that The Force Awakens left us with. I really do not understand high praises and scores. The last Jedi seems to be targeting younger audience. For original Star Wars fans this film is not. I really hope that viewers will be able to get past all the visual effects\\, forced jokes and cheap twists to give it rating that it deserves so that Disney would rethink their strategy for the episode IX.","true":true}
