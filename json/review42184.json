Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie set up and shot down more characters than it knew what to do with. It gave almost nothing to the overall storyline except some minor\\, predictable details\\, and made very interesting and entertaining characters from Force Awakens essentially useless. Po is made to be a reckless fool\\, Finn a useless piece of storyline until the end\\, and Rey her own damsel in distress\\, able to do nothing but bemoan her unknown parents and find force powers ex machina. Speaking of ex machina\\, BB-8 was the real hero of half the story. \\nThe dialogue contained far too much vernacular and in ten years will sound like someone saying \\\"groovy.\\\" The constant little one-liners and attempted jokes took away far too much from the seriousness of the story (something well-balanced in the Force Awakens) and felt forced after the first three. Oh\\, and the constant merchandising reminded me that Disney had its grubby little claws all over this one\\, much more than Force Awakens.\\n\\nIf you like the force being used as Facetime\\, little explanation for important plot holes\\, and having characters shoved into and out of your face\\, you'll like this movie. If you disliked the awful dialogue\\, pointless plot events\\, and constant character creation of the prequels\\, this movie will make you leave saying \\\"at least we finally saw a decent lightsaber scene after the first hour and a half.\\\"\\n\\nWorst Star Wars movie since the first two prequels\\, the only movies it tops. Guess we gotta wait until 2019.","true":true}
