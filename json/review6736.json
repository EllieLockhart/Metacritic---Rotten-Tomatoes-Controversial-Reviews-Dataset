Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to all the negativity from these \\\"hard-core\\\" fans that are just too nostalgic with the old that can't cope with moving forward. Rian Johnson makes a risky turn in this movie breaking with what was expected for this movie. The answers to the questions that TFA created are not the ones that we were theorizing about\\, however they still deliver and move the plot forward. Enough with the old and predictable. Episode IX should be a masterpiece as this one is.","true":true}
