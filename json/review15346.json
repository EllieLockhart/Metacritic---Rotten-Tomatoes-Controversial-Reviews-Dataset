Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll put aside all the obvious points well-discussed here. Even if you agree with the \\\"artistic\\\" choices\\, the third-act was way too long\\, had too many false endings\\, and there are too many characters\\, all competing for screen time to do heroic things\\, to care greatly about any of them.\\n\\nStar Wars now suffers from the same weaknesses that plague so many of the comic book movies now thrown at us from all directions. For the professional movie critics to ignore this in Jedi is a little bit hypocritical.","true":true}
