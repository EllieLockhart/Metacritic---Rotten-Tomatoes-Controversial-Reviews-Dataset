Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first movie I've ever seen in a theatre where I pulled my phone out of my pocket mid-way through to check the time.  It's not only a bad star Wars movie\\, pooping on all established lore and character development\\, but it's a terrible movie in general.  Plot holes are everywhere\\, there is no character or plot development\\, and over an hour of the movie is completely pointless and goes nowhere.  Nothing in this movie makes any sense\\, nor does its high ratings from \\\"critics\\,\\\" who clearly need to re-evaluate their career choices.","true":true}
