Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is good overall\\, lots of great moments and wonderful visuals.  I do feel The Force Awakens was a better movie\\, this movie was an enjoyable movie with many satisfying moments.","true":true}
