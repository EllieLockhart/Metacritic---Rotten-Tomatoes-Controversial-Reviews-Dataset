Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing character evolutions and arcs render the plot borderline silly and purposeless during significant sequences of the film. Misplaced humor - due to timing\\, tone\\, and even technological antiquity (leave a message lame comment from Poe to Hux) felt insincere and forced as opposed to the quick sarcastic\\, albeit cheesy spat that made the originals appealing and sincere.  More importantly\\, Star Wars has ALWAYS focused on the hero's journey - the failures\\, the successes\\, the flaws\\, the strengths\\, the fear\\, the confidence\\, the love\\, and the love - all of the complex mental\\, emotional\\, and spiritual polarities that exist within the hero (and even villain\\, in some cases) that manifest in the form of physical tribulations and challenges that are overcome or failed.  This is precisely where TLJ fails. Rey; our primary hero\\, is the same basic character we saw in TFA\\, though she has some new abilities and the viewer has a slightly better glimpse of her potential as a Jedi but not as an actual being\\, as someone undergoing profound changes and upheavals to become great.  In order for that to happen\\, failure of the greatest order must be witnessed by the viewer to make the transformation believable.  Otherwise\\, we are simply watching the aftermath of a character's arrival to greatness.. The first two films failed to establish this necessary arc and thus far only Kylo Ren is the only character who has experienced any significant evolutionary conflict that propels the plot.  Finn has his original moment in TFA when he makes his most critical character choice\\, but since that moment\\, his character has been stifled by erratic\\, unnecessary plot devices  that revolves around  the silly notion that the entire Resistance Movement might actually come down to needing a gas station and Keanu Reeves in Speed to keep the primary spaceship from stopping\\, ever - as if it couldn't be surrounded.  All of this is happening as Finn's potential as a transformative character vanish in a series of sub-plot lines that actually don't advance the main plot in a cohesive manner.  Like Rey\\, it feels like Finn is the same character he was in TFA\\, which means the storytelling failed.  The same is true of every character is the movie\\, even Luke - despite what some reviewers are suggesting.  It's one thing to create a new string within the Star Wars Universe\\, but when that string unravels three of the top films in the franchise via the central protagonist\\, that's usually shortcut storytelling that ultimately wants to shift its focus to the future before a natural progression transpires with a new plot device to supplant the old device - or at least connect it.  The Luke plot line in TFA and TLJ doesn't mesh well with the mythos of Luke's character arc\\, and not does his dialogue in TLJ come close to mirroring anything remotely Luke-like. Luke's send off in TLJ is nothing more than a \\\"okay\\, it's time - we want to go in a new direction\\, even though we aren't quite sure where\\, just not here.\\\"  Luke really teaches Rey almost nothing.  She barely has an emotional reaction when he dies\\, the same is true for Leia. Eh\\, another bites the dust - like Han. If you enjoy action without purpose with some cool scenes\\, this is the right flick. If you enjoy storytelling with multiple  connected character arcs that tell several cohesive stories within the one palatable universal story of the Force and life and how it is all connected and where it goes and how it happens ... Re-watch the original Teilogy or Lost or Indiana Jones or something else because TLJ has all the glam but little substance","true":true}
