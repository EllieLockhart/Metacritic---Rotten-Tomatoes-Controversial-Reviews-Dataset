Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie has some pretty cool moments. Adam Driver steals the movie\\, but overall\\, just pointless. Luke is built up as a savior in TFA\\, but is absolutely worthless character in this movie. They spent the whole first movie trying to find him for this? What a disappointment!","true":true}
