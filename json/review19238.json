Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a coincidence most people who love this movie are liberals. It's also not a coincidence most critics who rate this a nearly flawless 9\/10 movie\\, despite it's numerous plot holes\\, flat jokes\\, and endless contradictions\\, are also mostly liberal.. Even more so\\, it's not a coincidence the media\\, most news sites\\, and the areas who's audiences they polled coming out theaters\\, are also majority liberal..\\n\\nAnyone that doesn't subscribe to liberal thinking\\, living outside of this bubble\\, sees this movie for what it is\\, 2 and a half hours of women in promoinent positions\\, bossing around the male characters for no reason other than to exploit the popularity of this franchise and use it as a platform to pander to people with these political leanings\\, sending a clear message that \\\"men are impulsive and wreckless\\\"\\, and \\\"it takes a woman to get things done\\\"..\\n\\nAnd not just once or twice.. this is a constant theme throughout the entire film\\, from Leia slapping Poe around\\, to Rei overpowering Luke\\, to Holdo becoming a Martyr\\, to Rose saving Fin\\, to Rei saving Kylo.. to the majority of leading characters on \\\"the side of good\\\" being women\\, to the majority of leading characters on \\\"the side of evil\\\" being men.. and on and on this goes..\\n\\nThis type of thing they do in movies today\\, where you're almost not allowed to decide for yourself how you feel about a character or story\\, they do it for you\\, rather bluntly\\, by repeatedly pounding the same messages over and over\\, insulting your intelligence. People don't like this.. they like mystery\\, they like being conflicted\\, they like being presented with a choice. This movie doesn't do that.\\n\\nIt's not a coincidence prominent people in the youtube community\\, both male and female\\, who review movies for a living dislike this movie. Many of them dumbfounded by the near perfect ratings given by critics\\, along with Mark Hammil himself\\, who in interviews has been giving generally confused and frustrated responses when asked about what he thought about the script\\, and the direction they took his character\\, saying things like \\\"this is not the Luke Skywalker I remember..\\\".\\n\\nA bit of advice\\, when a movie this popular\\, this old\\, with such a huge effect on our culture\\, spanning multiple generations\\, has the lead actor\\, the hero of the movie\\, publicly come out and dislike the script and the direction they took his character\\, something is wrong.. When the movie has a 53% audience rating on most review sites\\, and all people think to do is blame trolls? despite\\, politics aside\\, the films blatently obvious problems.. something is wrong..\\n\\nI could look past many flaws in a movie like this if it weren't for the constant bombardment of contradictions.. I mean take your pick.. The major blow at the end of TFA to the first order's even bigger deathstar base\\, yet TLJ acts as if this never happened\\, Leia scolding Poe for being wreckless\\, then 30 seconds later giving him permission to be wreckless again? Luke leaving behind a map to his location\\, only to tell us he doesn't want to be found? Snoke repeatedly telling Rei \\\"he won't betray me\\, he can't betray me.. OH! HE BETRAYED ME..\\\"\\, Luke coming out for a big 1 on 1 duel with Kylo\\, only to let us all down and show us Luke is just a weak old man not worthy of a heroes death.\\n\\nThis movie is a mess.. and absolutely does not deserve the 9\/10 rating people are giving it.?","true":true}
