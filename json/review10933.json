Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haters will hate. Movie is awesome. Personally\\, I'd love to see Luke lift that T-65 X-Wing from the ocean\\, go to Crait\\, and single handedly anihilate the First Orders forces...but he said he went to that island to die. Who am I to argue with Luke Skywalker?","true":true}
