Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disrespectful\\, outrageous and a disservice to the classic series. Unintelligent plots and characters that comes and goes without any possibility of attachment. Putting on Disney's terms\\, this movie is like the Lion King 2 of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
