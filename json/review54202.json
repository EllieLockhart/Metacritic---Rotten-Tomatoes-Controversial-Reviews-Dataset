Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this were a stand alone movie\\, my only criticism would be that they were pulling too many strings at one time.  The story was a bit choppy in the telling as a result.  However\\, this was movie 8 of a series\\, and as such\\, I thought it was very disappointing.  The director decided he would just reinvent some characters with little to no thought as to who they had been and what their motivations had been\\, previously.","true":true}
