Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow! Cannot believe they released this movie to the public. This was an awful star wars movie. It felt more like Guardians of the Galaxy 3 with all the terrible jokes and plot contrivances. Hate what they did to Luke. Did not match his character at all.  This was a very disappointing movie. I laughed out loud in the theater when Leia floated through space lol. Could not believe that.","true":true}
