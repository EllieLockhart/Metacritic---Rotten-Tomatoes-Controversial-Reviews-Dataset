Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A steamer for sure.\\n\\nThe \\\"professional critics\\\" have shown they are from Disneyland whilst those who pay for the privilege are from anywhere but. The critics could not have got their praise for this garbage more misplaced.\\n\\nPut simply there is no story worth the name. The attempted humour sucks. They have made Luke to be a problem not a solution. General Hux is more suited to hearing \\\"he's behind you\\\" as a pantomime villain rather than a character that can convey menace. Disney must have had an excess of plot holes to use up too before the years end plus a gross politically correct number of senior female rebels. Carrie Fisher STILL fails to produce acting worth even the poorest amateur dramatics - she was completely unable to advance her own character and the now infamous Mary Poppins in space moment will haunt her legacy.\\n\\nAny serious Star Wars fan should make it plain that Disney has ruined the Star Wars universe and ensure they do not pay to see any more of this garbage.","true":true}
