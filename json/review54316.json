Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I HATE this movie. I initially thought The Last Jedi was a cool title. I was excited\\, having seen the Force Awakens\\, to see where the story would go with the Skywalker saga. I was horrfied by the out of place comedy right at the beginning of the film. At this point I had a very bad feeling about the Last Jedi because a tone was set and it was not Star Wars. After enduring the time to sit through this awful movie\\, I left disgusted and angry. Disney allowed this garbage to release as canon\\, to be a part of the Star Wars legacy? NO! It is not my canon. This movie trashed the Star Wars legacy that George Lucas built. Not does this film defy the lore and rules already established in the Star Wars universe\\, they humiliated and destroyed Luke Skywalker. Nothing was answered from the Force Awakens and this was not a high thrill space opera. It was nihilistic trash with a Star Wars label slapped on it. It was a quick cash grab by Disney that went out of its way to spite Star Wars fans. I am done with Disney Star Wars\\, I HATE it. Let the next Episode of this disgusting sequel trilogy FAIL.","true":true}
