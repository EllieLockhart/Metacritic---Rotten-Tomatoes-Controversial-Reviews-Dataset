Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to leave this review. Where to begin? First\\, every great plot point set up by JJ Abrams' Force Awakens is utterly forgotten or comeletly mishandeled. Second\\, every CHARACTER in the movie is destroyed by Rian Johnson's desperate attempt to subvert our expectations. My interest in the new trilogy that TFA piqued is now decimated by this grotesque\\, bloated\\, nonsensical\\, misguided fan fiction. The smartest move for Disney would be to retcon this movie and start over. The worst Star Wars movie ever made.","true":true}
