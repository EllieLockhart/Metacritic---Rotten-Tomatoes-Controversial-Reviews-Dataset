Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"god this movie ruined Star Wars for me....looked like Star Wars(barley) but felt nothing like it\\, and dont get me started on that waste of time in the middle with finn and diversity hire Rose\\, and you know what else there isnt a single lightsaber daul in this movie!(the only star wars movie without one)its also the only Star wars movie set over the course of a few days\\, a week at the most\\, and thats all the training Rey gets yet shes already some master??!! I  mean come on! No charachter development whatsoever! Oh and lukes a cowered and he dies and snokes no one and he dies and  they didn't kill off leia(instead she played superman) so i guess in the next movie they'll just be like\\\"oh general leia? oh yea she died of a brain Arianism how tragic\\\".....and enough whith the corny badly timed marvel style comedy !","true":true}
