Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson delivers a visually stunning\\, genuinely shocking and emotionally entry in the Star Wars saga with The Last Jedi. Captivating performances by Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley and\\, specifically\\, Mark Hamill propel the film forward. In fact\\, Luke Skywalker's arc is the films most interesting plot line\\, making fans question a character they've come to love but still giving him a sense of purpose and redemption. While the film does lose momentum with its various side plots and overlong running time\\, the tight direction and writing keeps the film intact. For younger fans\\, the visually stunning action scenes compliment the films more intellectual themes. Overall\\, The Last Jedi delivers a near perfect entry into the Star Wars saga and a worthy sequel.","true":true}
