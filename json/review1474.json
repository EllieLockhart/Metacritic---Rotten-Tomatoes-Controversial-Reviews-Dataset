Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a film\\, specifically a film in 2017\\, it is strong. The directing was great\\, camera angles perfect\\, CG was spot-on. I think the acting is what it is. Doesn't seem that actors get cast for their acting abilities - more that they fit the look \/ quota the production company wants or needs. For the acting alone\\, I'm dropping a star. \\n\\nPlot holes exist in every sci-fi movie. I believe that's the \\\"fi\\\" part of sci-fi. You can always explain your way into or out of a plot hole in this genre. Also\\, we tend to analyze movies WAY too much these days and express our opinions on a single film based on our emotional reactions to other films or previous films in the series.\\n\\nWe need to stop rating films the way we do. It's toxic. A simple example is rating a movie on ticket sales \/ popularity. Kubo and the Two Strings is a perfect example of that.","true":true}
