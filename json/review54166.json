Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give this a zero or negative stars\\, I would. This movies threatens to destroy Star Wars. Its main flaw is that it disregards the legacy of all of the previous films\\, including The Force Awakens! The characters don't act like they have been shown to\\, the alleged main character is a Mary Sue\\, the movie is obviously infected by far-left propaganda (the so-called \\\"social justice\\\" nonsense)\\, and huge parts of the movie are pointless. All MaRey Sue does is steal some books\\, fight some action figures\\, and lift some rocks. Luke Skywalker is treated like trash\\, and Mark Hamill didn't approve of what he was forced to do. While it may have made over $1 billion\\, the same could be said of the Phantom Menace. I left the theater feeling empty inside\\, hardly able to believe that this dumpster fire of a film exists in continuity with the original three masterpieces. Any reviewer who gives this a \\\"fresh\\\" rating is doing so out of fear of being blacklisted by Disney\\, or because they share the same \\\"social justice\\\" sentiments as Rian Johnson\\, JJ Abrams\\, and Kathleen Kennedy. This isn't Star Wars\\, it's filth.","true":true}
