Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pre-movie: 93%? Awesome trailers? This is going to be incredible!\\nPost-movie: I'm trying to convince myself to like this movie\\, but I just can't. The more I think about it\\, the more I hate it. \\n\\nWhat I liked: Great fight scenes\\, and some incredible visuals. The last 1\/2 hour was easily the best part.\\nWhat I didn't like: There were so many unnecessary moments and new characters that there wasn't really any development for the original characters I cared most about. I left feeling like nothing significant happened in the film\\, and everything that I thought was going to be a big deal (Leia\\, Snoke\\, Rey's past) ended in a letdown.","true":true}
