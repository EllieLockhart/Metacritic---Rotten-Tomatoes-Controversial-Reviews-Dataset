Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I put half a star cause It's better than the previous movie.\\n\\nWhat could I say that hadn't been said\\, Rey continues to be a Mary Sue\\, a character I don't care at all of\\, Ridley has improved her performance tho. Kylo Ren continues to be a pathetic villain\\, also a little less tho cause is in this movie he doesn't get his ass kicked by a Janitor-trooper and a junkwoman. Luke character doesn't has anything to do with the Luke from the original trilogy apart from the name and a long etc that this movie don't deserve my time writing.\\nBy the way\\, I used to be a huge Star Wars fan\\, I remained that way even after the mess with the prequels\\, but I think I'm not anymore ... it's clearly the lady from Disney that I don't even know her name\\, and I really don't care knowing it\\, wants to tell another story I don't care about. Creating a story where the only heroes are women\\, like Mary Sue Rey\\, Rose (What a pathetic character that don't even let Finn character have a purpose)\\, The commander with violet hair (Where did she came from? What was the idea with her? Couldn't they just make Admiral Akbar be the hero?)\\, Leia flying like Mary Poppins when any other force user haven't ever do something similar (Not even the Emperor when Vader killed him by throwing him to that hole)\\,  and making her the only main character that survives from the original trilogy (Ironically being her dead in real life). Just name it Star Wars (bad) feminist edition.","true":true}
