Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars Movie and the beginning of the end of star wars the way we knew it. I never post reviews on movies but wanted to leave my mark on this film as I've been waiting years to finally see the end of the skywalker story unfold. I saw the film twice and feel completely as tho everything that made star wars special is now going to be sewed by the persons in control of the star wars universe. PS: that is not the fans. \\n\\nThe over all message is the balance\\, or is it? this movie is so out of balance its ridicules how many times they try to make the point evil operates in the MAN form and not just from Men\\, but particularly While men.","true":true}
