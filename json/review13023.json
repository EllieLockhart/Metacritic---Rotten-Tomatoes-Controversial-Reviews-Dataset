Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't get it. Why are people championing this movie? It falls short in every way. They've sprinkled marvel dust into the sacred formula. Have you seen the hobbit trilogy? Have you seen the 8 Pirates of the Caribbean films? this is just like that\\, full of cheesy one liners\\, forgettable characters and plot holes. I was very satisfied with The Force Awakens and I was so excied to see more but Disney Disneyfied the whole thing.","true":true}
