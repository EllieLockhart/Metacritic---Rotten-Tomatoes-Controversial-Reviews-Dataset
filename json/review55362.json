Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it after being super disappointed with the Force Awakens. This wasn't a perfect movie by any means\\, had some disappointing story lines and others cut short and was a bit bloated\\, but overall had a fantastic action\\, twists and satisfying fan service.\\nON A SIDE NOTE: There was one overhead shot of Chewy and the Millennium Falcon that calling it HORRIBLY AWFUL would give it a compliment. It appears the ship was 1\/10th scale\\, very bad they left that in the final cut.","true":true}
