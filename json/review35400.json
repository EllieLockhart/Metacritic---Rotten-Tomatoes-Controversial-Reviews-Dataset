Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi blew my mind. It was nothing I expected\\, but everything I could've ever wanted. I am simply stunned. Of course\\, like any movie\\, there were parts that faltered: moments that seemed like a bit of a reach\\, some characters\/motivations not fully explained\\, etc. It looked and felt nothing like a Star Wars film and it was this fact: the cinematography\\, the pacing\\, the bold risks\\, the incredible performances\\, that launches this film to the near top of the Star Wars franchise. The Last Jedi has been the only Star Wars film in a long time to actually expand the universe\\, our idea of the force\\, and push storytelling boundaries. I have never been more impressed.","true":true}
