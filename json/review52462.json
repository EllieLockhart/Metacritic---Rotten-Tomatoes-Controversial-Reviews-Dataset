Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great Star Wars movie\\, but a terrible movie to be in the trilogy. This review will contain mild spoilers. \\nAfter rewatching The Force Awakens\\, I can say with confidence that The Last Jedi is filled with plot holes. None of the questions from the previous film is fully answered\\, the whole casino-storyline feels forced\\, the characters keep making stupid decisions over and over again\\, and it just felt really off. The tone was all over the place. It was the most Avengers-eque Star Wars film - so yes\\, it had bursts of entertaining moments\\, but also had way too many jokes. And not the 'Star Wars' type of humor\\, but just manufactured quirky lines that are purposely designed to make you laugh. \\n\\nIt had potential\\, but was just all over the place. I just hope the next instalment can save this trilogy.","true":true}
