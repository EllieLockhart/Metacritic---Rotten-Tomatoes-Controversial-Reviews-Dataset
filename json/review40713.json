Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This looked like a Star Wars film but it sucked my head\\, heart and soul dry. I hated the SJW Agendas and pissed me off big time.  Visual effects\\, sound design and musical score was good. Most of the deleted scenes in the DVD should have been included in the movie. Ruin Reylo Johnson is an arrogant snobby self righteous novice filmmaker and bad writer. He didn't take risks and gave TFA the middle finger. It is a poorly made film with shallow characters which literally destroyed Legendary Luke Skywalker.  Oh and Leia as Space Jesus...????????????","true":true}
