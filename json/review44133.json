Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To begin with\\, I'm neither a bot nor a troll. This movie is terrible from start to finished. I'd put the best parts of it on par with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and that should not be in any way construed as a positive endorsement. The production value is lovely; sets\\, costuming\\, special effects\\, all A+ to B at worst. But the story\\, the dialogue\\, the acting\\, the reasons I like to imagine most  people take the time to sit through a movie\\, are a travesty. While some of it rises to mediocre at times\\, the vast majority of this bloated film lacks any ability to evoke emotional reactions other than boredom\\, disbelief\\, disappointment\\, and disgust. At this rate it'll take a couple more films for the franchise to rank alongside Michael Bay's Transformers in terms of entertainment value and quality. Save your money and time\\, this film's worth missing.","true":true}
