Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)\\\" features some of the best scenes in the series\\, and I think the first act is really solid. The only real complaints I have about the rest of the film involve the thread given to \\\"Finn\\\" and \\\"Rose.\\\" While it has good intentions\\, the writing isn't the strongest\\, leaving the actors to do the best they can with what to have to work with.","true":true}
