Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the hilarious floaty Leia zooming about the screen: few filmmakers have the courage to realise their dreams\\, but Johnson dreamed of making Mary Poppins and by God he did it.  Also worthy of note is the brave decision to have two characters head off on a pointless sub-plot that literally does nothing to advance the plot.\\n\\nIn other courageous decisions\\, who else would have had the hutzpah to make Luke a lazy coward who expires from a spot of light astral projecting?  And what about the massive mysteries that were laid out: why did the double-crossing hacker get paid in cash and a massive ship after he got caught along with the other two?  who knows?  Maybe he was the real last Jedi and said \\\"you want to give me cash instead of simply executing me\\\"?\\n\\nLazy\\, stupid and awfully plotted.  Nice fight scenes\\, though.","true":true}
