Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a pile of shit....i  was 5 when i saw a new hope and since then i have been a star wars fan...im now 46 and i cant believe what rian johnson has done....the force awakens was ok and it left alot of questions unanswered ready for episode 8......especially when luke appears at the end...i had a lump in my throat...took me back to when i was a kid..so i was excited to see the last jedi...but rian johnson did not follow anything the jj had set up for in the force awakens...he completely did his own thing and fucked the story up....no one wants to see luke drinking green tit milk from a space cow....ray is a mary sue...no proper training at all and she  can beat luke in stick fight...fuck off....leia is now mary fuckin poppins lol...canta bite...what a fucking waste of film time...snoke ..more powerful than the emperor and vader yet kylo ren can kill him like that...fuck off....Disney or should i say kathleen kennedy has taken the best franchise ever and flushed it down the toilet....no one wants politics in star wars its an escape from the real world...dont need to put your sjw agenda shit in it....you have killed off the best characters and no one gives a shit about the new ones...avoid this film at all costs...worst star wars film ever","true":true}
