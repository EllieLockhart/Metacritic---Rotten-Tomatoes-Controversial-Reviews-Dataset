Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were parts of the film that was fun and some really well done scenes\\, but the movie as a whole was not good. Just because a movie is 'fun' does not make it good. I believe that a lot of people are simply basing their good reviews on how fun the movie was. I or anyone else for that matter can have fun watching a Transformers movie\\, as long as we turn our brains off and just enjoy the ride- and critics hate those films. Star Wars is different\\, it has a long standing lore\\, it follows rules- and when you break those things and replace them with politics then you are missing the whole point.
