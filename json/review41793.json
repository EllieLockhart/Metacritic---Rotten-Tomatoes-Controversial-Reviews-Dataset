Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is really original. It is the story of a martial art teacher who fails at instilling good values into his apprentice's mind while making him more powerful than himself. He tries to stop him before he does something really bad. Then the master dies becoming a cloud of dust at sunset. Kung Fu Panda is really an original movie.","true":true}
