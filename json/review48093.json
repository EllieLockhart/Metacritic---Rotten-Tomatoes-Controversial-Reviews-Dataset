Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the last Jedi movie was better than the force awakens\\, and had better creative choices and storytelling\\, this movie makes it feel like the original star wars movies led no where and accomplished nothing.  It's ashame Disney feels it necessary to kill off all the original characters. \\nThe movies feel like they're just copying similar plotlines from original movies. An empire and a rebellion. We never get to see the Jedi order fully restored\\, they're always hanging on by one person.\\nAlso didn't like how they handled Luke Skywalker. We never really get to see him in a role as a Jedi master. They made him a hermit\\, gave him a very brief come back\\, then remove him from the story to reprise in the future as a ghost. Not a fitting role....\\nAlso felt too much like the empire strikes back","true":true}
