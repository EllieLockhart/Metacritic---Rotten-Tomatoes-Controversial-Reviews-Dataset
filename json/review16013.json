Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan and I was bored by this movie. Sure\\, it didn't meet my expectations but that's not why I didn't like it. From Rey hardly being trained by Luke\\, to the boring Canto Bight sequence\\, I feel like I wasted a vacation day and money on this film.","true":true}
