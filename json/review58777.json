Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I am appalled by how bad this game was. How did Naughty Dog manage to bring themselves to tear down one of the most impactful\\, well written and executed\\, memorable games ever made and then try to manipulate you into liking Joel\u2019s killer? This game sold itself on being a revenge plot but it\u2019s so half assed and watered down it absolutely falls flat. It drops it rather fast to then force you to play as the person you\u2019ve been wanting to kill for over 6 hours. This game is full of cliches\\, soap opera melodrama\\, contrived circumstances\\, terrible writing\\, and grating pacing. The flashbacks are used mostly terribly. It\u2019s so bad\\, there\u2019s even a flashback within a flashback within a dream. Not only does it destroy the pacing further it absolutely takes you out of the moment and makes the weak narrative it\u2019s trying to push even more complicated for no really good reason. I honestly can\u2019t blame the review bombers. While I\u2019d normally not condone it\\, in this case I do. It\u2019s absolutely shameless and just another indicator how SJW and woke agenda is destroying the entertainment industry\\, not caring how it destroys the legacy of a series. This needs to stop. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re going to make The Last Of Us Part III. I hope after this absolute misfire they get it right. I hope that it\u2019s not going to be a case of The Last Of Us being a case of lightning in a bottle.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
