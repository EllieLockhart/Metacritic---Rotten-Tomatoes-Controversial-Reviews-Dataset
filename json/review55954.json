Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's Marxist take on Star Wars is not appreciated. Johnson's theme of demystification isn't just an attack against Skywalker and the force\\, it is an attack against Chrisitanity. I love how Johnson invents a Jedi version of the bible just so he can burn it. It's pretty clear which side of the divide between good and evil Johnson stands on.","true":true}
