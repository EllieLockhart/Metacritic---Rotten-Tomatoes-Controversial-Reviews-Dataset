Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was and still is a huge mess. I highly recommend this movie to absolutely no one. It seems that Lucasfilm is trolling by adding 5 star reviews. Please don't fall for this. Rian and Kathleen have made a 1 ?? movie at best. - Give is a break already.","true":true}
