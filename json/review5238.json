Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decepcionante\\, aburrida e incre\u00c3\u00adblemente conveniente\\, su existencia es un desperdicio\\, Disney est\u00c3\u00a1 m\u00c3\u00a1s interesado en exprimir la franquicia y de paso propagar sus asquerosas agendas\\, que en planear una buena historia con personajes memorables","true":false}
