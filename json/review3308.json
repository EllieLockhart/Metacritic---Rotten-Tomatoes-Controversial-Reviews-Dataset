{"101487":108587,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before I begin my review\\, I would like to say congratulations to every Star Wars \\\"fan\\\" for completely missing the point of a brilliant movie. With that being said\\, here are the pros and cons of Star Wars the Last Jedi.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Smart Beginning and Ending Battles\\n-Acting is superb as always\\n-Visual effects are good (since it's a Star Wars movie.)\\n-Kylo Ren is actually a conflicted villain\\n-Passing of the torch\\n\\nCons\\n-Finn storyline was a bit weak\\, but at least it was tied into the end of the movie.\\n-Snoke isn't as interesting as Kylo Ren\\, but he isn't the main antagonist\\, in fact Emperor Palpatine didn't even really show up until The Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nScore: 4.5\/5\\n\\nConclusion: As a movie\\, this is very well-crafted and actually has some smart storytelling points. As a Star Wars Movie\\, it subverted my expectations of what a Star Wars movie could be with fresh ideas and characters. Quite frankly\\, the flaws in this movie are easy to get over unless you're one of those people who are dumb enough to hate this movie (which I'm not offended by) whilst simultaneously having one of the dumbest usernames in existence (bob% being one of those people with quite atrocious nicknames.)","true":true}
