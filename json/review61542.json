The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Gameplay and visuals are incredible (can't wait to see it on next gen consoles). Sometimes I paused and used the photo-mode to capture some of the jaw-dropping set pieces (classic Naughty Dog).\r\rThe stealth mechanics were some of the best in any game I've played\\, mainly because they were more realistic than other games that use similar mechanics (but still offers a significant advantage to the player). For example\\, you'll have dogs sniff you out if you get within a certain detection distance and enemies can spot you from pretty far away. If you're in the grass\\, it doesn't completely shroud you from detection if they get close enough and you're in their line of sight. The AI is also pretty clever in this game\\, making for some tense situations. If you're quick enough and have good aim\\, you can silently take out enemies and avoid combat at higher difficulties. The thrill of sneaking past some of the absolutely horrifying monsters in this game combined with the factions hunting you down really gets the blood pumping.\r\rI didn't have much of a challenge playing through the game. I played on hard mode my first play-through and had numerous occasions where I was fully stocked. There are some tough boss fights\\, but there are numerous autosave points to make fights easier. So if you like a challenge\\, you'd probably be fine starting out on survival difficulty honestly. Just make sure to explore and to move\/kill from the shadows as best you can.\r\rAs for the more controversial topics\\, I liked the characters. They're animations and conversations seemed realistic\\, the facial animations were stellar\\, and the developers fleshed out most of the characters just enough to understand their personas and motivations. Obviously\\, the structure they chose just made gamers rage against the machine\\, hence the mixed reviews. Out of all the things that make this a 10\/10 game\\, such as the gameplay\\, the visuals\\, character development\\, first openly lesbian couple in a game\\, references to the complexity of gender identity ( all of which wasn't in your face about it)\\, the little details in the combat\/easter eggs\/environment \\, hilarity in the light hearted moments\\, the flashbacks with Joel and Ellie\\, the clever level design and AI\\, sound design and ambience.... ALLLLL that\\, and you **** up the structure of the game? ND could have kept everything they had here\\, restructure the game\\, and you'd have a definite 10\/10\\, GOTY on your hands. Sadly\\, I have to painfully give this incredible game an 8\/10 for this one criterion.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
