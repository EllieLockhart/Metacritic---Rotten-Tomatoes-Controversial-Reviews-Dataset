Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can we just back up and do TLJ all over again? My brain was having trouble realising if I liked it or not. Only because I'm a Star Wars fanatic and had the highest hopes and expectations of this movie. Regular movie goers might enjoy\\, but hardcore fanboys and those that really follow the lore and would see the movie 5 or 6 times will only be paying to see this once. So much wasted potential. Disney is also in denial about it's failure. J.J. Abrams\\, you're our only HOPE!!","true":true}
