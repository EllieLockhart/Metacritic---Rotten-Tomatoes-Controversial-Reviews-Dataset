Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was as good as any Transformers movie sequel. Yes\\, the special effects are nice and the cinematography is done well\\, but the plot is just plain lazy. This film ruins what the past 7 films have established. Character have no progression and the film seems wasted as a result.","true":true}
