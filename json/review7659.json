Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything wrong in modern film directing. A director being given a product and delivering a result skewed to their own political viewpoints while disregarding the lore\\, character history\\, and audience. The movie has become so unbearable to watch that I do not even consider it a Star Wars movie any longer. It is an accident that must be hidden from future generations of fans.","true":true}
