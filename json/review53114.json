Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly solid 2 stars. The things I liked we're seeing familiar faces of past characters and new versions of Star Wars tech\\, vehicles\\, and weapons. \\nI went into the film with 2 main questions: 1) how will the cinematography compare\/contrast to the original trilogy's and 2) would it use the Joseph Campbell's \\\"Hero's Journey\\\" plot structure (which heavily influenced Lucas' screenwriting style\\, 'A New Hope' is a perfect example of this structure).\\nThe cinematography was beautiful\\, not much of a match with the original style\\, but aside from unmotivated dolly shots during mission briefing\\, all of the visuals were gorgeous.\\nThe story had so many plot holes. Characters get out of jail free\\, get what they want\/need without having to do the work\\, the 'mind connection' between the main characters made me wonder if the filmmakers were unable to get the actors in the same room to shoot that part and it was rewritten to have them in separate settings - made dialogue feel like monologue\\, lastly because many side characters are included yet have no purpose in furthering the plot. \\nAs a 20+ year devoted Star Wars fan\\, I have never been more disappointed after viewing a Feature length Star Wars film. Dramatic irony and foreshadowing\/payoff plot strategies are missing\\, therefore making the characters and situations they are in feel at a further distance\\, rather than feeling immersed in the story. It feels to me that Disney executives were striving to widen the demographic of fans as much as possible to maximize on merchandizing of cute cuddly creatures and Rebel Alliance ID rings - they're smart... \\nI watched it once and I don't plan on watching again any time soon - especially since it's about 2.5 hours long. I honestly really wish I enjoyed this film.","true":true}
