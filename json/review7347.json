Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VIII takes us on a journey we haven't been on yet. Johnson took the same risk Taika Waititi took in directing Thor: Ragnarok\\, and we all know the masterpiece that turned out to be. The Last Jedi took all of your expectations and shoved them back in your face\\, delivering fresh material and unpredictable emotional twists. I saw it twice in one day and can't wait to go again\\, and it will be a miserable two years until we wrap up this amazing story in Episode IX\\, but TLJ will keep me busy until then\\, and I'm going to fall in love with it more every time I see it.","true":true}
