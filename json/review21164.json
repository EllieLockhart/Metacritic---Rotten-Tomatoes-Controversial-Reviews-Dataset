Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed with the outcome of this movie. I believe the plot twist has just killed off many long time Star Wars fans. I know many millenials and forward may not see why\\, but those of us born before then have just lost something that was special. I understand the fact that they are trying to create and establish new characters for the future to carry on the franchise\\, but you don't do that by disenfranchising the rest of us. This was a sad day in movie history. I had to come home and watch episode V\\, the Empire Strikes Back\\, (which to me is still the best) just to feel better.","true":true}
