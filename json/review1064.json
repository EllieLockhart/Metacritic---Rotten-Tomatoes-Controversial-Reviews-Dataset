Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A-\\, not the best star wars yet\\, and maybe not as great as a TWA\\, but better than the prequel trilogy\\, and a great addition\\, a lot of humor\\, a lot of great twist. A good movie in the beginning\\, slow in the middle with a few plot lines and characters that could have been left out\\, some plots from the TWA that basically got nerfed\\, unless they get un-nerfed by JJ in 9\\, and then a great!!! movie in the second half. Two or three truly WTF moments. I saw it twice already\\, and will definitely see again.","true":true}
