Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This thing was almost as bad as Jurassic World. A complete misunderstanding of what Star Wars is about. They took it away from Lucas exactly so we wouldn't get a repeat of the prequels and now that's pretty much what we got. At least in the prequels we only had to endure Jar Jar Binks. Ever character in this Movie is fodder for ridiculous I'll timed comedy. So disappointed.","true":true}
