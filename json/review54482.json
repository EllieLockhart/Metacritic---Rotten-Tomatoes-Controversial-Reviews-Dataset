Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this film. Not just because I'm a huge Star War fan\\, but because it was genuinely great. It brought a new and exciting tone to the Star Wars universe. The movie does suffer from having a couple bland characters\\, but makes up for it with amazing ones. Rey and Kylo go through an amazing journey in this film and I am exicted to see where it leads. Overall a solid entry into the ever growing Star Wars Universe!","true":true}
