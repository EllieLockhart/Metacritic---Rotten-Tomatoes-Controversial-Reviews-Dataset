Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think way too many people are over analyzing this film. In this day and age of just poor movies\\, this one is actually better than what some are going on about.  Yes we don't know much about Snoke\\, but we didn't know a damn thing about Palpatine for decades.\\n\\nIf Rey in this movie had the \\\"I am your father moment\\\"\\, it would have been roundly critiqued. They are building a story with a new generation. Let it flow and enjoy the ride.","true":true}
