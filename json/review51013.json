Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolutely appalling sequel released purely for the potential money that can be garnered from a film due to its association with an established franchise. As Disney anticipated\\, the hype around this film was massive prior to release. I too was very excited due to quite enjoying the Force Awakens: despite its many flaws\\, it had a reasonably compelling plot with some interesting characters such as Kylo Ren. Moreover\\, it felt very faithful  to the franchise as a whole. \\nThis film however not only ruins long established characters such as Luke but also manages to ruin those conceived in TFA. The plot is the kind of thing that might appeal to five year olds and the tone is just all over the place due to insertion of Marvel-movie type humour that is cringe-worthy at best. Not sure how anyone can see this film as having any tension or semblance of dark tone: the so-called bad guys are made to look so seemingly incompetent that they are basically a non-threat whilst the rebels' apparently 'dire' situation is devoid of all seriousness by repeated use of aforementioned humour.","true":true}
