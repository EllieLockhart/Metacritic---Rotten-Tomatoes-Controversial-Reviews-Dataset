Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is gorgeous. It boasts a wonderful cast of characters all portrayed by talented actors especially Carrier Fisher in her portrayal of general Leia Organa and Kelly Marie Tran in her portrayal of Rose Tico. The movie used a good balance of practical affects and visual affects which makes it one of the most visually impressive Star War films to date. The story was sound with several plot twists of which none of them were contrived\\, and included humorous and light hearted elements the kind of which were saw in the original trilogy but not in the prequel trilogy. The film does fall short of being a masterpiece due to some minor issues like the overly long casino intro scene\\, the conversation with Maz breaking the flow of that scene\\, why Luke is so profoundly jaded\\, and why the last scene with Luke happened which together dragged the film down.","true":true}
