Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Second worst Star wars movie after the force awakens. Bad storyline\\, bad characters + actors\\, horrible dialogue and humour. the only thing that puts it above force awakens is that it has at least some interesting visuals and kylo is pretty decent.","true":true}
