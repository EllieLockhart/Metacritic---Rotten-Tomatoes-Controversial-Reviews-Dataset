We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Visuals\rBeautiful. Great details. I do not expect lesser given it's reputation as a triple A title. In this day and age\\, other than WWE 2K\\, graphcs should be stunning.\r\rGameply:\rMoving mechanics remained the same with left\/right strafing\\, right analog to control direction you are heading.\rCrafting is similar.\rDodging mechanic are welcome but mediocore at best. Just a series of quicktime events\rThere's a jump button\\, but it's basically useless. My grandma can jump better than the in-game charcter.\r\rOne reviewer claimed that it's the \\\"Best Stealth game\\\" of all time. (Laughs in Metal Gear). On the pH scale of 1-14\\, stealth is 14 cause it's very basic. Many times when I'm behind a cover and an enemy is approaching\\, I receive the prompt button before he's even close. Ellie pops and jumps a distance to grab the enemy for a stealth kill. This looks completely unrefined to me and is light years away from what other stealth game has achieve.\r\rStoryline:\rBoy oh boy\\, what a mess. Politics aside\\, this game completely subvert your expectations. We understand Joel is not exactly a saint but ND seems determined on schooling us with \\\"cycles of revenge\\\" storyline. It's as cliche as it sounds and everything is done for shock value\\, edgy for the sake of being edgy.. The first few hours just renders everything the first game built useless. This is just plain unwise given that there's so much emotional attachment to the game charcters. Imagine having Arthur Morgan die in RDR2 and then you play as Micah Bell\\, how would you feel?\r\rThere's no way to root for the new protagonist at all.\r\rMetacritic would probably filter out many \\\"0\\\" as review bombs\\, but if video game journalist can freely give 10\/10 as they please\\, why can't us consumer?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
