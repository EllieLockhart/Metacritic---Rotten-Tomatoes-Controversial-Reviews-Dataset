Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is going to cut the Star Wars community down the middle. I am so utterly disappointed. I haven't really done a lot of reviews\\, if ever\\, on here\\, but I want to send a message to Disney and Rian Johnson. You screwed up. Big. For the first time since 1977 I don't care what happens next in the Star Wars universe. I have no more questions. What you answered didn't satisfy me and the decisions made are baffling.\\n\\nI would give this a one star rating\\, but there were SOME redeeming moments and it was well shot\\, just horrible... HORRIBLE writing. \\n\\nI come into a movie like this with two sets of eyes. One as a fan and one as someone who loves movies. It failed me in both ways.","true":true}
