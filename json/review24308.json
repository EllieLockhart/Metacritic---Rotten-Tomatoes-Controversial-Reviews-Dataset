Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Might as well be a stand alone film. This has nothing to do with any of the other star wars films. In fact\\, as much as I didn't agree with force awakens for similar reasons\\, I was actually looking forward to seeing development and backstory of Snoke and the first order. Also the knights of Ren and how Maz got the light saber. FORGET ALL THAT STUFF is apparently the message that this film gives off. It can't even link itself to the prior movie\\, let alone staying in the rules and laws of the originals. What a mess of a film. Disney do not have the rights to do anything cool with star wars because they do not have the rights to the best novels\\, graphic novels and best ideas that have been and gone over the years.. So they do stupid things which remain the only ideas no ones touched\\, and why would they indeed","true":true}
