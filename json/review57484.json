Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very similar to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Star wars needs to surprise me more\\, not borrow things from the old movies. Leia using the force could have been done so much better; Captain Phasma is barely used; comedy is overused which detracts from the fact that the characters' lives are in danger; Holdo doesn't tell everyone the plan for no reason; Luke dies for no reason; Finn just acts very stupidly. This movie made me face palm so many times and I was left very disappointed.","true":true}
