Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its over folks a dead franchise brought to you buy shoving in characters when you are supposed to be tying up plot points \\, as well as shoving cape movie humor into the entirety of the film as well as ridiculous camera time spent on trying to sell merch (Porgs) and 2 plot points that are go nowhere. Great job disney Now I'm ashamed to be a starwars fan again.","true":true}
