Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly a beautiful movie. It looks amazing\\, sadly to enjoy that you must throw away all sense of storytelling and character development. The movie tried \\\"new\\\" things for the Star Wars universe such as having an entire movie with no character development. They also tried this thing where they set up an emotionally impactful scene and then do a 180 on it. In the end\\, the only thing to be gained from this movie is a newfound understanding of how much Hollywood thinks its viewers are morons.","true":true}
