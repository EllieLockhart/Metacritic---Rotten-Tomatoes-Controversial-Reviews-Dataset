Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney have really ruined Star Wars\\, forever. This is not Lucas's Star Wars universe\\, this is not even mine. So many things wrong with this movie and so many stupid dumb scenes. Gutted\\, really gutted. Force Awakens was a much better movie. Rogue One probably the best offer from Disney. Really underwhelming movie and the story is just drawn out and pathetic. So what is going to happen in Episode 9? The resistance will still be on the run from the first order?","true":true}
