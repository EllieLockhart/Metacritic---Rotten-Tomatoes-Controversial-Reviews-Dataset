Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really wanted to like this film\\, but it falls way short. Lame and ludicrous describe too many scenes\\, Another director\\,  a few reshoots between Kylo & Luke and could of had a great movie. It's down there with Clones and Revenge on the sucko factor.","true":true}
