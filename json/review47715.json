Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When i saw TFA i was disappointed because of a copy pasta. RO disappointed me with how bad everything was. TLJ was the film that really killed SW for me.","true":true}
