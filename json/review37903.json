Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script writing for this movie is horrendous. There are a half dozen minor story lines that have no consequence to the overall story. It routinely leaves story threads dangling only to reintroduce characters in critical moments. A fifth grader could do a better job at script writing then these paid \\\"profesionals\\\".","true":true}
