Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The danger here is that Disney\\, the most powerful film corporation on Earth is participating in dumbing down of quality\\, and the bastardization of modern myth.\\n\\nThey are playing with fault lines they don't fully understand. Dumbing down plots\\, three dimensional characters\\, and tampering with the childhood heroes of the young adults of today\\, means their own destruction down the road (though their boardrooms don't realize this yet. They think they can milk mediocrity forever-- not so.). The more \\\"user-friendly\\\" games\\, films and dumbed down content are churned out\\, the more panderers and populists will win in elections\\, in business and the more dangerous runaway capitalism will become. Say what you will about George Lucas\\, but his main worry was his own vision\\, never the quick buck.\\n\\nDisney's killing of Star Wars is far more important than anyone thinks. They are tarnishing\\, in fact\\, fraying the cultural fabric of the society they live in. That in itself is unforgivable.\\n\\nIn short; Disney killed Star Wars.","true":true}
