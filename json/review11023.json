Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HEAVY SPOILER ALERT:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall this movie was underwhelming.\\n\\nRays training with Luke - Lots of build up with little pay off\\n\\nPrincess + Force = Eh wasn't feel it... \\n\\nBarely any saber battles and force using...\\n\\nSnoke : This mysterious powerful figure introduce finally but then gone so fast????  Obviously feeling like that may not be true in the next movie but not enough character development with him ...\\n\\nCaptain Phasma: Another central figure\\, well introduced but let go so soon...\\nLuke: They could have done SO much more with him... Everyone wants to see his strength and skills... we saw that in 1 scene for about 2 minutes... then he disappears... COME ON... 3 main characters. HUGE characters... gone... granted he will probably come back the same as a \\\"you know who did\\\" next film but major downer for me... so much build up again little pay off...\\n\\nRay is suppose to be the next thing? She has impressive strength and instinct but she is still a beginner... Her saber training was the extent of the trailer... The torch is passed but the flame isn't lit...\\n\\nI wish these weren't my thoughts... let down...","true":true}
