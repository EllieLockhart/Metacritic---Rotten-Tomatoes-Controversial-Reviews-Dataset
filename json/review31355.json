Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some great moments\\, but just didn't hit everything for me.  Spoilers:  The Finn plotline was stupid.  Wanted more Finn\/Poe or Finn\/Rey.  They could have cut the Finn plotline and the movie wouldn't have changed.  \\nLots of logical inconsistencies with the 'chase' where ships could get in and out even though the empire was there chasing the rebels - the lightspeed trick which only makes sense if this was the very first movie of star wars - otherwise people in every other movie would have done it.  Rose - really\\, need a love interest for Finn so you can push Poe\/Rey?  Argh.","true":true}
