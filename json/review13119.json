Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont know where all of the negativity is coming from. I absolutely loved this movie\\, and also brought two of my friends who weren't really into star wars to see it and now they're in love with the franchise. Brings some lore into the movie and old characters stay true to the classic trilogy. Amazing.","true":true}
