Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Absolutely loved it. Though I must admit I wish Joel had much more of a heroic death\\, if it had to happen\\, and it wasn\u2019t so near the beginning of the game. Initially I despised Abby for her actions and was even extremely annoyed that the player was forced to play as Abby for a very long portion of the game but towards the end I understood her actions and it was almost hard to paint her as a villain. I even held back at the end fight scene between Ellie and Abby because I didn\u2019t want her to die! I can\u2019t believe you made me grow to ALMOST like the woman that killed my Joel. Well played Naughty Dog\\, well played. I truly think you should go into this game uninfluenced by any posts you may have seen written about this game. I believe it is a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
