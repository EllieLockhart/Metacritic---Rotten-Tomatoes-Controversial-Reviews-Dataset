Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know it's the unfashionable thing to say online right now\\, but I don't care - I love The Last Jedi. The characters we came to love back in The Force Awakens continue to grow from their experiences\\, the effects may be even better than Episode VII\\, and the story takes us in unexpected places. Rian Johnson takes us in a direction we never imagined we would go in. For Star Wars (and all other continuing series regardless of medium) to be able to thrive and move on\\, chances need to be taken. If our storytellers never take chances or change things up\\, we will be watching\/reading the same things over and over again for as long as entertainment exists. Though I respect those who didn't like the movie based on legitimate complaints (all film is subjective\\, after all)\\, I can't begin to understand disliking it because it was \\\"too different.\\\" This especially frustrates me because there were those who criticized The Force Awakens for being \\\"too similar.\\\" Maybe some Star Wars fans need to step back and reevaluate what they want from this franchise. If you just want to stick with Episodes I-VI\\, more power to you. However\\, I prefer my Star Wars saga to be growing\\, changing\\, and diversifying with each new installment. Now\\, I'm not saying this is a perfect movie (the humor doesn't land once or twice and a few of the plot devices\\, to name a few things)\\, but these aren't complaints that make me not enjoy this movie. Despite giving it the same rating\\, I find The Last Jedi to be a step up from The Force Awakens\\, and just maybe the best film of the series since The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
