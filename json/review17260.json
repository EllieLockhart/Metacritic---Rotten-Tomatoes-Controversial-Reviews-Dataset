Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really tried to like this movie\\, but unfortunately bad pacing\\, terrible character development and lack of storytelling between The Force Awakens and this film really took the energy out of the film.  There is 20 to 30 minutes of the film that need to be cut out.  The Casino scene between Finn and Rose was brutal and unfortunately slowed the movie down to a halt.  To me it never really recovered.  The storytelling had very similarities to Harry Potter or Avengers\/ Marvel.  Now that Disney owns the franchise you can really tell the storytelling is geared toward the Harry Potter\/ Avengers\\, formula:  Lots of Characters\\, many side plots\\, unresolved conflict\\, good vs. evil.  This type of  formula who a name like Star Wars is geared to make the most money.  Disney knows this and is using it to their advantage.  Good for Disney\\, bad for the fans and audience.","true":true}
