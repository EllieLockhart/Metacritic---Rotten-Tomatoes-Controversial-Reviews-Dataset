Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This isn't just the worst Star Wars movie\\, it's the worst of anything in the entire Star Wars genre. The score also goes to show how out of touch and agenda-driven professional critics are.","true":true}
