Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll keep it simple I am a big fan of Star Wars I've seen every one of them more than once actually few times just to see every detail and that includes the Phantom Menace and this going to be the first star war movies that I don't wish to see again I was very very disappointed.","true":true}
