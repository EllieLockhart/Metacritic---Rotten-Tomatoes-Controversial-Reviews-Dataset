Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really looking forward to this film and only found it average plus my partner fell asleep.\\nThought rouge one was a more exciting film in my personal opinion and didn't think it was nowhere near as good as the critics were saying.","true":true}
