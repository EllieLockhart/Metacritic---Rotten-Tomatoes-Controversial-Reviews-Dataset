Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without  saying any spoilers the one thing I can say is it was disappointing.  For someone who grew up with Star Wars I had expectations for certain things in this movie and it didn't meet them in the slightest.  The movie itself is a visual marvel but the story felt lacking.  I felt like I might have been the only want to feel this way but after reading countless reviews since it's released last night it seems like I'm not the only one.  It would've been a great standalone movie but being the eighth one in a series that is spand generations again I think the best word to describe it would be disappointing.","true":true}
