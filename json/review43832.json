Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will be entertaining for most dedicated fans. I like the new direction the series is taking with respect to a new generation of rebel fighters. I agree the movie was long and could benefit from further editing. Still it was nice to see Carrie one last time.","true":true}
