Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its time...... for the franchise..... to end.\\n\\nIt has ended for me at least: \\\"Star Wars: The Last Straw\\\" killed any remaining love or hope I had for the franchise. I'm done. I'm out. And I'm taking my hard-earned $'s with me.\\n\\nThe sad thing is that Disney CAN afford to ruin Star Wars: They own Marvel... Pixar... ESPN... ABC... 21st Century Fox... and of course\\, LucasFilm. \\nThey CAN afford to pay off critics. \\nThey CAN pay off Rotten Tomatoes to freeze the audience score at 49% (even though its clearly far lower).\\nThey CAN afford to push political agendas without worrying about backlash. \\n\\nBut for what its worth\\, they won't be doing it with my money. I'm boycotting the Solo film\\, episode IX and every other piece of crap they stick a SW label on.\\n\\nOver and out.","true":true}
