Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment for me. \\n\\nI went to see it on the evening of December 14th. \\nI hadn't kept up to date with trailers for it the way I did for The Force Awakens but went in completely open-minded and hoping for a good time. \\n\\nLuke Skywalker was my childhood hero. \\nRian Johnson in this movie demonstrates that he does not understand Luke Skywalker's character. \\nHe uses nearly every opportunity to disrespect Luke (and anyone who admired Luke) and assigns thoughts and actions to the character of Luke Skywalker which are absolutely contradictory to what we observe of Luke in A New Hope\\, The Empire Strikes Back\\, and Return of the Jedi. \\nIn other words\\, I do not consider this movie (at its core) to be anything other than unimaginative and incompetent fan-fiction which fails to understand the source material. \\n\\nThe movie overall is disrespectful to its characters and its audience. \\nIt is flippant in tone at the most awkward times and constantly undercuts any respect that the audience tries to give it. \\n\\nThroughout the movie\\, humor is attempted to be inserted\\, but it does not fit the situation or character and nearly always feels out of place.\\n\\nThe movie spends so much time attempting to portray what it falsely sees as a sophisticated view of morality that it forgets that heroes are meant to be heroic. \\nAlthough it attempts to give us some justification for why Kylo Ren is the way that he is\\, it mostly fails to make us believe that the villains of the movie have any sincere mission. \\n\\nThe result is that we find ourselves frustrated with people who are meant to be the heroes of the story and we fail to believe in the villains as any sort of legitimate threat. \\n\\nThis movie also continues to treat Rey as a Mary Sue\\, just as The Force Awakens did before it. \\nWe do not see Rey struggle to achieve things or initially experience failure when attempting things. \\nInstead she succeeds the first time she attempts things and continues to outclass her peers who have more training than her. \\nThe only struggles that she experiences are other people's failures to react rightly to her. \\n\\nIt is unfortunate that Carrie Fisher passed away before Episode 9 was created\\, as this movie was not created with the intent to bring Leia Organa's story to a close. \\nMy feeling is that Rian Johnson mostly squandered his opportunity to do something meaningful with Carrie Fisher's last film performance\\, just as he squandered Luke Skywalker's character. \\n\\nWe are given one beautiful scene between Luke and Leia in this movie\\, although the surrounding circumstances hinder the scene's potential meaningfulness. \\n\\nThe interactions of Rey and Kylo Ren are really the only part of this story which works in any meaningful way. \\nEven this story thread\\, however\\, is hindered by awkward moments and the fact that Rey should still be reeling from the death of Kylo's father. \\n\\nThe story thread of the First Order pursuing the Resistance is a failure on essentially every level. \\nThe scenario doesn't make sense\\, the strategy doesn't make sense\\, and the characters don't make sense. \\nThere is no suspense. Instead we are simply frustrated repeatedly. \\n\\nThe story thread of Finn and Rose's mission is questionable to begin with. \\nI wanted something good for these characters\\, but I did not enjoy the art style of the planet that they went to\\, nor most of the aliens there. \\nThat planet honestly felt like something out of the Star Wars prequels\\, in terms of awkwardness. \\nThere was also very overt and clumsy political propaganda in this sequence\\, which felt out of place. \\n\\nI agree with Rose's line that how we win is by saving what we love\\, rather than destroying what we hate\\, but the fact that she tells this to Finn directly after she stops him from saving the remaining Resistance members from death makes her statement ring hollow. \\n\\nI cannot think of a single positive adult male role model in The Last Jedi.\\n\\nUltimately\\, I don't think that The Last Jedi works as a satisfying story in its own right\\, it does not work as a sequel to The Force Awakens when watched back to back\\, and it does not work as a continuation of the original Star Wars trilogy. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens had Star Wars vibes\\, but ultimately stole far too much story directly from the original trilogy. \\nI had hopes\\, going into The Last Jedi\\, that a new director could maintain that Star Wars feeling for Episode 8 but do something new story-wise. \\nInstead\\, it flails awkwardly and clumsily\\, while casually discarding and misusing the only Star Wars characters worth caring about.","true":true}
