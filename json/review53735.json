{"101487":123077,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gone are the days of the lovable Star Wars characters\\, replaced by these cartoonish\\, predictable ones that I just can't fully get behind.  The likes of Poe and Finn just can't set themselves in the realm of appreciation we had for Luke and Han and the earliest SW heroes.  The scene where Finn is saved from sacrificing himself just irked me the wrong way.  He was about to save the day\\, and the annoying Rose stops him? In what would normally spell the end for them both anyways\\, along with the rest of the good guys holed up in that mountain?  Oh please\\, you can let a major character die a heroic death.  Not everything has to be tied up in such a neat bow where all the major stars miraculously survive.  The humor was bad\\, and there was way too much of it.  Luke became both annoyingly comedic and annoyingly pathetic in one fell swoop\\, losing that lore that surrounded his character for so long.  That shocking fight scene with Ben\\, that was probably the dumbest thing in the SW franchise.  It made the fight irrelevant for both sides (\\\"oh\\, but it bought them time\\,\\\" yada yada yada); it was stupid.  A fight where neither fighter could be hurt\/killed\\, come on now.  It was a joke.  And like most of Luke Skywalker's jokes\\, it was a bad one.  The whole talking to one another when you weren't really near the other was another stupid ploy.  Most notable being Ben and Rey\\, connecting on new levels\\, more yada yada yada\\, stupid.  The Last Jedi was better than Rogue One\\, but is\\, in my opinion\\, the worst from the episodic films in the franchise.  It's not bad (I know I'm sounding like it's terrible).  It's a fine enough film.  It just isn't Star Wars caliber.","true":true}
