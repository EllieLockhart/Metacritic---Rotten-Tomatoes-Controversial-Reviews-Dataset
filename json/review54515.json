Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love this movie it was awesome! One of my favorites\\, but please oh please get rid of the ship \\\"Reylo\\\". A ship is relationSHIP that is made online by fanboys and fangirls. Sometimes fanboys and fangirls ship people in real life. I like the idea of Rey being an awesome heroine who discovers herself\\, fights against the First Order\\, along with learning the force. It would be a great influence compared to\\, someone who had a lot of potential and married an emotionally unstable person. I don't think Reylo will ever happen. SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD Rey went to the First Order base to bring Kylo back to the light and nearly got killed. Ren also says that Rey's parents were people who sold her for drinking money. I'm not sure if this is true because all Rey said before that was they were nobody. Which could be because of this scene in a cave with multiple versions of herself where she asked who her parents are\\, and another version of herself appeared. So Kylo could've been lying since he knows that is what really could get her to join the dark side. SPOILER ALERT OVER. This ship also reminds me of Padme and Anakin\\, but that made more sense because then there would be no Luke or Leia. There are a few sad parts in this movie but there is not such thing as the perfect movie. So don't let it ruin Star Wars for you.","true":true}
