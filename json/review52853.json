Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A masterfully shot garbage fire. A beautiful mess. Stunning visuals but the story is atrocious. Plot holes you could fly an A-Wing through and leaning on the force as en Ex Machina even more than usual. Worst of all is the disservice it does to core original trilogy characters. Far\\, far worse than even the prequels. I expected it to be bad\\, I expected a samey rehash like TFA or empty fan service like Rogue One but I didn't expect something this bad. Just hitting reset and making the Alliance the underdog again totally devalues everything already in the franchise.","true":true}
