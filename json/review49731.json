Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF did Rian Johnson do! The film looked like SW but did not feel like SW. Visuals look great but the script was utter crap. For me this was worse than the prequels. I'm voting with my wallet so bye bye Solo and Ep IX and any other Disney SW films\\, you really screwed up.","true":true}
