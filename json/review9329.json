Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Generally had a very fun experience at the theater the two times I went to see it. But I have to admit there a lot of unanswered questions as well. What sticks out to me is a fantastic choreographed fight scene involving Kylo and Rey (trying not to mention spoilers) replete with cheering and raucous shouts from the theater audience! There are a lot of surprises in this film\\, and it needs to be given some credit for that...even if a few might be disappointing to long time fans.","true":true}
