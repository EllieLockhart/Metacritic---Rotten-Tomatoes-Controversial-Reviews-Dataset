Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching Episode 7 and Rogue One\\, I had such high hopes for this movie. I absolutely adore Star Wars\\, and this movie felt like a slap in the face. It was ridiculously long\\, poorly paced\\, with terrible writing. In moments that should have been serious there were absurd dad jokes\\, and there were characters joking that would never joke because it's outside of their character to do so. You can tell the actors felt the same because the acting was so forced. The few scenes that were good (maybe ten minutes of the entire film) \\, were really good\\, and that's the only reason this gets two stars from me. Sad day for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
