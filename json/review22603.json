Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lifelong casual stars fan here and I really enjoyed this movie. Of course it's not perfect....no movie is. I had trouble with parts of this film but as a whole we loved it.","true":true}
