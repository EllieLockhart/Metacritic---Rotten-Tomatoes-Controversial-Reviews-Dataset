Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Years of hype just went down the drain. Spoilers: ......\\nCharacters came and gone with no explanation\\, over an hour can be cut off and it would not affect anything. Story does not add anything to the saga so far apart from minor question which were answer in such a terrible way. \\nThis is killing me inside that one of the best characters i grew up loving was given such a bad exit this is just sad.","true":true}
