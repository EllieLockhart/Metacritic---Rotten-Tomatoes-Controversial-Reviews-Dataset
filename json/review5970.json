Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. So tired of liberal agendas creeping into entertainment. \\\"Save the animals!\\\" \\\"Men are dumb and weak.\\\" \\\"Women are strong and wise.\\\" Each male had a female \\\"handler.\\\" Rose tased Finn. Leia tased Poe. Rey beats Luke and Kylo. And a porg corrects Chewie's carnivorous ways. And Disney wanted to kill off the evil white patriarchs: Han and Luke. Agenda?","true":true}
