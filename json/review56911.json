Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second trailer for this movie almost set up a path for how this film would play out. From a fan's perspective\\, I was very excited to see this movie\\, and I know so was the fanbase. SPOILERS AHEAD!\\n\\nThe introductory battle over D'Qar was controversial\\, as there was good scenes with the interior of the star destroyers and the dreadnaught\\, but there was cheap humour thrown in that you make you chuckle the first time you watch it\\, and just hate the second and continual times you watch the movie. The theme of hope and resistance against a greater force has been done before in 'A New Hope' (1977) and 'Rogue One' (2016)\\, and was done well but now is being overused. I hated how one pilot could take out all of the dreadnaught's surface cannons against huge odds. Although\\, I did enjoy the bomber sequence\\, as it was two sides facing off in a battle with new ships and it being interesting. \\n\\nThe movie also made the first order to be extremely powerful and just to overpowered\\, yet one ship\\, \\\"The Raddus\\\"\\, could take down Snoke's Mega Star Destroyer\\, and all of the other capital ships. At first I liked the Luke and Rey scenes\\, but learning Luke tried to kill Kylo Ren\\, was so out of character and some fans believe it ruins the fan favourite character. The Crait battle was cool\\, but again the theme of a tiny group defeating a massive opposition is just ridiculous.\\n\\nEvery Star Wars movie to date\\, is set after its predecessor (movie timeline). For example\\, A New Hope finished after the Battle of Yavin\\, and Empire was set three years after that battle. Return of the Jedi was set one year after empire. The same goes for all of the prequels. This is so we can explore a different aspect in each movie\\, but Ryan Johnston's movie set just after The Force Awakens.\\n\\nI Johnston could change a few major details in the film\\, but it is over now and we all should move on. I hope Abrams Episode IX will be a step up from Johnston's movie\\, but doesn't borrow to many aspects from other films the way The Force Awakens did with A New Hope.","true":true}
