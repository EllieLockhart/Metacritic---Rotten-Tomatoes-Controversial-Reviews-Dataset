Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a huge let down. overlong with pointless sub plots. terrible ending that made no sense. the overall plot or lack there of was befitting to a C movie at best.","true":true}
