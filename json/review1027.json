Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another great movie after The Force Awakens.Great Character developement\\, great visual Storytelling  and beatiful cinematography\\, VFX and of course John Williams music. (Love the Theme \\\"Battle of Crait\\\"","true":true}
