Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched it in theater\\, ruined Luke's character for me. I didn't like how the movie wasted the audiences time with the Canto Bight arc and the whole Ryan Johnson's \\\"subversion of expectation\\\" where Luke throws his lightsaber. Holdo \\\"sacrifice\\\" was given to the wrong character and made cheap. It should have been Achbar to save everyone by ramming his ship and that use of \\\"hyperspace\\\" to ram into an opponent... Don't get me started there. RJ shouldn't have opened that \\\"Pandora's box\\\".","true":true}
