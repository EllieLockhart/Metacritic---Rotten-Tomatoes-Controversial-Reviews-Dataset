Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now I can say thank you for brining Star Wars back\\, where episode 7 failed massively\\, episode 8 really delivers. I could not predict what will happen next\\, and I kept guessing\\, and that was Star Wars excitement\\, your in for great moments\\, don\u2019t hold back.. Send off your loudest cheers while watching ep8\\, the Force is strong with this one. Note: Mark Hamill performance stole the show","true":true}
