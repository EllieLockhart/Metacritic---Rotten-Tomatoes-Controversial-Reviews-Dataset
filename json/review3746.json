Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than The Force Awakens\\, but still major issues and lack of creativity. Why not have Kylo go good after killing Snoke and have Ray go bad or something catchy like that? \\n\\nThey can't catch the rebel fleet 50 yards in front of them??? Lightspeed ahead of the ships and catch them\\, send out smaller cruizers that are faster\\, just 2 points right there.\\n\\nWhy is Luke milking that thing?\\n\\nCute out Rose and hacker guy\\, and let Finn die\\, and the movie is much better.\\n\\nIf Luke has to die\\, fine\\, but he just gets tired after the hologram trick and dies? Lazy.","true":true}
