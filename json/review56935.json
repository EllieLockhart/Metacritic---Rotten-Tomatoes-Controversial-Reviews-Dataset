Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was awful\\, the plot was poorly written. The way the handled Luke Skyswalker was the worst charachter murder ever by Rian Johnsson who has the audacity to think he did a good thing. I used to love Star Wars\\, even found TFA at least ok. At first I was very upset with that they totally ruined Star Wars\\, then something happened\\, I just stopped caring. So now I dont get upset\\, feel no interest in more starwars movies. As long as Disney and Kat Kennedy is at the helm i will certainly not go to a new Star Wars movie at the cinema\\, I am totally unintersted in Solo a star wars story and also in Episode 9\\, I just dont care and wont watch them\\, period\\, good job Rian Johnsson you arrogant PoS","true":true}
