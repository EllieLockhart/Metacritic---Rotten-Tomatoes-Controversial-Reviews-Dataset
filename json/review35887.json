Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is without a doubt\\, the boldest entry in the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson's new direction for the series is risky and subverts audience expectations. Unfortunately\\, this film is unexpected in a way that feels similar to ordering a pizza\\, opening the box\\, and realizing that they forgot the toppings.\\nThis film succeeds with its direction\\, acting\\, cinematography\\, special effects\\, production design\\, and choreography. But where this film fails is in the script. The most important thing in the Star Wars universe is the characters and instead of developing the characters\\, this film decides to strip them down for a purpose I hope I begin to understand by the time the next chapter rolls around. You really have to admire Johnson for attempting to turn this saga on its head\\, but when you walk this thin of a tightrope\\, you must be careful to maintain your balance. This film is a tonal and structural mess that convolutes the story of this trilogy and opens up several major plot holes that are hopefully addressed as the saga continues.","true":true}
