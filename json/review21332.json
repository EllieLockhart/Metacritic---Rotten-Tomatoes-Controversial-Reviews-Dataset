Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to this movie wanting to see epic lightsaber battles\\, closure for my old favorite characters and awesome effects.  While this movie had a few pretty solid scenes\\, they made up only about 15% of the overall runtime.  The rest was useless filler with gaping plotholes.  *****SPOILERS BELOW I could sum this movie up in a few sentences that would sound like this: The first order was slowly chasing the resistance who were running low on fuel...Poe is kept in the dark about a secret mission  by a new person in charge...Leia should be dead but now all of a sudden uses the force to come (fly) back to life...Finn meets a new person who serves no real purpose and goes on a mission to find a code breaker to help the resistance and Rey recieves no training from a very crotchedy Luke.  That's about it.  And luke dies the dumbest death ever.  There are no cool new droids\\, aliens\\, villains or characters.  As a matter of fact Snoke and Phasma both die too.  So aside from the bad storytelling and lack of anything really interesting going on I would give this a big thumbs down.","true":true}
