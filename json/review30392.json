Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Semaj S\\, I'll cite Mark Twain:\\n\\n\\\"Never argue with stupid people\\, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.\\\" \\n\\nYou have to be very naive and childish to like this movie. If you like bright lights\\, deafening sounds\\, intense colors\\, characters moving around without clear intentions or motivations\\, stories without a start or an end... well... continue watching Peppa Pig.\\nLeave movie critic to the grown people.","true":true}
