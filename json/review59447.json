Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The first game was both the heroes journey and villains origin. On one side Joel goes from being a jaded smuggler to a loving father figure and he also goes from being the smuggler to being a slaughter of innocence. The first game sets us up in the second game has to start in that place and live through it.\rAfter finishing the game and thinking back to the beginning of starting in Jackson and even going to Seattle day one feels like forever ago and it has to. Like no other this game uses narrative and gameplay together to connect the player to the character in this incredible link that is one of the biggest feats of storytelling in recent memory. When Joel died I felt just as Ellie did\\, when Ellie killed Nora I was visibly shaken like Ellie was\\, finally when the fight occurred between Abby and Ellie I was exhausted and  done with all of it. This was always the mission of the first game to connect the player in the characters in a way that wasn\u2019t possible through any other medium. This game takes everything that the first had in the rule that was set out that was if nothing else write honestly everything has to feel honest there\u2019s no fan service there are no moments that we as the player are given everything and finally satisfied because that would feel wrong. The story is there only to be told\\, And it is only told because it has to be.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
