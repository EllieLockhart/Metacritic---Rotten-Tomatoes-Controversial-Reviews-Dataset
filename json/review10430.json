Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"+ Great music and special-effects.  \\n- The story is filled with plot holes and bad timing for cringe-humor\\,\\n- beloved characters are unused in favor of new uninteresting characters.\\n- completely unnecessary sub-plot\\,\\n- Ray is still a \\\"mary sue\\\" with no character or interesting things about her.\\n\\ni do not recommend this movie to any star wars fan.","true":true}
