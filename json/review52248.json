Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fun ride until you start thinking about it. Star Wars is always about the lore and story\\, but when you forget about it is all but Star Wars in the title and setting. So many plot holes\\, so many poorly treated characters\\, and generally a lack of respect for the lore.","true":true}
