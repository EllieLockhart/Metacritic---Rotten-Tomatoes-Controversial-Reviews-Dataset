Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great piece of Star Wars. It sure was a bit silly in places and a little over long\\, but personally I loved every second. Along with the packed out audience\\, I laughed\\, smiled and watched in awe\\, as well as got a little choked up at a few bits. OK\\, I would have made some different decisions if it were MY version of Star Wars\\, but it\u2019s not and felt refreshing to see the way things played out. Would I have liked Luke to not keel over and die after some heavy meditation at the end? Of course! But really looking forward to seeing how part three plays out.","true":true}
