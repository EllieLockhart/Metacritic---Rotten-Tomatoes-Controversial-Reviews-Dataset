Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic entry into the Star Wars saga. The most original of the films to date Rian Johnson has taken the series into a new an unexpected direction in many ways.\\n\\nThe emotional and climactic finish will leave us all anxiously waiting for the next chapter in 2019. Bravo!","true":true}
