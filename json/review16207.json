Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm in my 30's and have grown up in the Star Wars universe\\, unfortunately this movie typifies what's wrong with the franchise now .  Basically Disney is killing off the old characters to make way for more easily marketable diverse\/shallow characters to MAKE MORE MONEY.  The most ironic part of the movie is Disney vilifying the \\\"military industrial complex\\\" and \\\"the globalists\\\" aka the casino planet scene: Disney YOU are the globalists and money makers that profiteer off of the working classes of the world.   I don't want to rant\\, but the Luke Skywalker in this movie\\, in my mind\\, is in no way shape or form associated with the Luke that I have grown to love over the past 30 years.\\n\\nI'll go to the theater next December to be disappointed again and again until I learn my lesson.  Its just so hard to say goodbye to an old love..     \\n\\nPositives cool space battles and planet environments graphics\\, The books\\, video games\\, and comics are still good.","true":true}
