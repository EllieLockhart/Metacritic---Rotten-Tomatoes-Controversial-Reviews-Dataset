Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This 2.5 hour movie should have been about 1 hour\\, 45 minutes or less.  The bloated story and unnecessary storylines were made nearly unwatchable by the terrible dialogue.  Furthermore\\, this new installation suffers from the phenomenon that Mr. Plinkett (see his YouTube video) observed about The Phantom Menace: the characters are hard to describe without talking about what they look like.  It's not as bad as TPM\\, of course\\, but even Luke and Leia have had the things that made them so compelling completely drained and replaced with empty dialogue designed to keep the plot moving.\\n\\nStrong points: good action\\, high stakes situations\\, a deepening of the story already established.  Overall\\, however\\, I don't think I'll be rewatching this one.","true":true}
