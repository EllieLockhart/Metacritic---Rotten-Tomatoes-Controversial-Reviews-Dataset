Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I understand what director Rian Johnson was trying to do - his writing style and direction literally killed the film. Every major character arc and loose thread from Force Awakens is either ignored or destroyed entirely. Every beloved character is brushed aside or unceremoniously discarded. What's left behind is an often awkwardly-funny\\, shallow shell of a star wars movie that feels overlong\\, and often times takes us down unnecessary paths. Little respect was given to star wars lore here and with the mantra \\\"everything old must die\\\" - what its replaced with doesn't instill much excitment for the future of the series. JJ Abrams has a lot of work to do if he wants to save this trilogy.","true":true}
