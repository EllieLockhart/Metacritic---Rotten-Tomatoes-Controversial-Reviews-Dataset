Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks to Disney my childhood is ruined. George Lucas should have kept to his word and left it at 6 because now his legacy is being diminished to crumbles of the disgrace of what Disney calls Star Wars! The story line is \\ncompletely forced\\, making absolutely no sense why we're watching what we're watching. I can think of so many thrilling ideas of how to spin off return of the Jedi and literally all they did was mimic the exact same plot of the original films. But they failed on new levels of scales. Throughout the first 6 films there's a purpose to the galaxy\\, story\\, and characters. Now you can tell they just desperately slapped on some characters\\, tagged them some names and just pitched the classic empire vs rebels theme with a side pathetic excuse for a Jedi story. If they didn't have any ideas they should have just left it alone\\, instead of implanting random boring characters that mean nothing and ripping off the original plot to try and please Star Wars fans. That's a pathetic excuse for a new trilogy\\, and Disney should be ashamed!","true":true}
