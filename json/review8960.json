Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From all of the previews\\, the hype leading up to the movie\\, and the setup in The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi was really setup to blow away all expectations.  True the film does take some admirable risk and effort that went into producing this beautiful looking film\\, constant tacky puns and unfulfilling character arcs limit this movie's potential.\\n\\nPlot holes seem to be plentiful\\, and the twists that the plot does take in the movie just didn't speak to me.  They definitely wanted to shake things up but the presentation didn't strike me as \\\"space opera\\\".  Just moments of tension that either don't pay off or are interrupted with a joke and lives on the line.","true":true}
