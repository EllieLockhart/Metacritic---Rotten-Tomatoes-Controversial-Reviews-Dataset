Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abysmal. I was disappointed in the weak characters\\, Mary-sue super powers\\, forced feminism and diversity of TFA\\, but seeing a hero defiled and discarded was too much.\\n\\nLook was a true hero. His life was hard\\, he face opposition and adversity constantly\\, but he never gave up. The force was not just given to him\\, he had to earn it through punishing training and repeated tests and failures. He was strong willed\\, morally good\\, and he persevered.\\n\\nNow he's gone\\, and we have purple haired kamikaze dyk*s\\, obnoxious affirmative action characters\\, and one last Jedi who is the best just because of her genitals it seems.\\n\\n\\nI'm truly saddened by this.","true":true}
