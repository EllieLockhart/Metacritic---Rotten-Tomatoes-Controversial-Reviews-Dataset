{"101487":138195,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In reading the political news articles about the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for The Last Jedi\\, there was an accusation that most of the bad reviews were just trolling done by crazy\\, hateful\\, \\\"alt-right\\\" activists to protest the political messages in the movie. Apparently\\, a lot of those reviews were written by people who had never even had a Rotten Tomatoes account before. They literally just signed up to write a bad review for The Last Jedi. In light of this\\, I will say\\, upfront\\, that I am NOT an alt-right zealot. I consider myself an independent and until now have not associated strongly with either extreme (although I definitely have to say that movies like this are slowly starting to make me very wary of the the extreme liberals that seem to be taking over every form of media\\, using it for prosylatizing their extremist views and not even trying to be subtle about it anymore). I did\\, in fact\\, create a Rotten Tomatoes account just to review The Last Jedi\\, but that is simply because I have never been so disappointed by a movie in my life.\\nI am a massive Star Wars fan. The series has been my favorite franchise since before I could talk. I buy Star Wars collectibles\\, books\\, and all forms of memorabilia. And every other Star Wars movie I was old enough to see in the theater\\, I went to about five times each because I couldn't get enough. I was even surprised by how much I loved The Force Awakens\\, which was the first movie not written and directed by George Lucas himself. So this is the strongest statement I could make about this movie: I WILL NEVER GO TO SEE ANOTHER STAR WARS MOVIE AGAIN. \\nThe Last Jedi was NOT STAR WARS. I don't even mean that I'm a picky fan who is going to hate every installment as it comes out because I'm so attached my memories of the old movies and therefore automatically hate any \\\"fresh\\\" take on the franchise with \\\"new ideas\\\" (which is what The Last Jedi was trumped up to be by so many critics). I was never like that with any of the other movies; I always had something to complain about with each new addition\\, but I still LOVED each one ultimately. And I thought the the ACTUALLY fresh take and new ideas of The Force Awakens were incredible. I do not simply have a resistance to change. I DO\\, however\\, have a resistance to terrible story lines\\, and flipping a huge finger at the other movies of the real Star Wars saga. And that was exactly what this abominable movie was\\n\\nThe very first thing I realized to this end was a general boredom about half-way through the movie. In thinking about it\\, I saw that this was largely due to a major departure from the overall feeling of the real star wars films. George Lucas often wrote corny dialogue\\, and rarely wrote deep and complex themes and plots. Some of the charm of Star Wars was its simplicity and lack of great academic gravity\\, but along with this simplicity\\, there was a powerful epic feeling to the stories and the themes AND the settings and photography and general direction of the previous installments. The pacing was perfect and every scene and frame seemed to have a specific meaning to the whole. You always felt a great purpose to each of the movies. While the trailer for The Last Jedi promised exactly this (It's visually stunning and the story it implied seemed pregnant with epic ideas and a powerful story line\\, just like the previous movies)\\, the movie itself fell flat on its face. It did have its stunning moments and some epic visual sweeps\\, but then sort of seemed to just slow into a general drudgery of a movie that goes nowhere. I think even the visual aspect of this was due to the incredibly weak story and writing. Instead of having a grand structure and feeling to the story\\, the writer seemed to actually be ACTIVELY trying to castrate any of the grand designs and themes created by the other movies. So much of them are so successfully subverted that as you watch the movie\\, you slowly realize a sense of meaningless to it all that causes you to not even be interested in finishing the move. The \\\"themes\\\" that the movie DID have were increadibly weak ill-fitted tack-ons that came out of nowhere and played like awkward platitudes. And THAT is what leads to what I consider the REAL evil of the lumbering\\, heavy-handed political propaganda. \\nInstead of tapping into the timeless and beautiful (NON-politcal--or at least non-bipartisan) themes of good and evil\\, a random new character is created out of nowhere in order to have no purpose in the story other than to spout awkward liberal ideals like \\\"rich people are bad because the only way you can be rich is to have slaves\\\" (not a direct quote but close enough)\\, and \\\"The only way we're going to win this war is not to kill what we hate...but to save what we love...\\\" None of which themes had anything to do with the rest of the story (or lack of story) but just popped out of nowhere like annoying commercials in a TV movie. And that new character happened to be an incredibly annoying\\, rambling\\, unattractive Asian girl. So it kind of seemed that even the basic incarnation of the character herself was a pushy extremist liberal statement of inclusion and pushiness. And don't get me wrong: I love women characters (Rey from the first movie was one of my favorite Star Wars characters)\\, and I have no problem with having Asian characters in Star Wars. But was Michele Yeoh not available? Ziyi Zhang? Someone with presence and talent that could be a great contribution to the movie?  While I do not think that just having overt poilitcal elements is what actually ruined the movie\\, I do believe that there was more attention payed to those annoying ideas than there was to trying to create a good\\, aesthetic story. And either way\\, the idea that some idealist zealots (who seem to be the exact same kind of people as those on the opposite end of the politcal spectrum\\, the religious zealots) actually hi-jacked MY Star Wars--MY beloved childhood memories--to just create a copy-paste billboard for their stupid political propaganda is. downright. ENRAGING to me. And I would be just as pissed if the Mormon church managed to be the one to do the hacking and then smeared the movie with propaganda about how being gay is bad. \\nThis has gone on way too long because I'm way too passionate about this\\, so I'll just say one more thing: even not comparing the story and the overall movie to existing Star Wars films\\, the story was just plain bad. One of the three main branches of the plot invests greatly in a supposedly important mission with a lot of running around\\, and then ultimately has NO MEANING WHATESOEVER to the outcome of the story. It was the most pointless leg of a plot I have ever seen (this is the Finn-Rose storyline)\\, another leg of the plot is dedicated to taking everything  about the Rey character that was so masterfully set up by J.J. Abrams in the Force Awakens and just dashing it on the rocks. Were you intrigued about the mysterious character of Rey\\, where she came from\\, and what her great destiny would turn out to be? Too bad. Rian Johnson decided to just throw all of that away and say that she was nobody\\, from nowhere\\, with no real destiny or much of a purpose in the story at all. And the final leg of the plot unrolled like the phoned-in story of a generic weekly tv show plot that was stretched out for three hours. \\\"We're being chased by the empire and we're running out of fuel!...we're still being chased\\, and the fuel is pretty much gone!...yup still being chased....\\\"\\nThis fake Star Wars movie wasn't just bad\\, it was aggressively bad. Even though it was just a movie\\, I will remember for years that watching The Last Jedi was one of the worst moments of my life.","true":true}
