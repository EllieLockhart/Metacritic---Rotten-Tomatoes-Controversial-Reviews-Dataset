Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi killed my childhood. Ive seen the movie Twice now. once with Wife and friends\\, 2nd to take my kids and both times my heart sank as the  movie basicaly destroys ep 1\\,2\\,3(still dont care for prequels)\\,4\\,5\\,6 and makes what we where taught inconsequential while painting that starwars is now a FEMNAZI series(rogue one\\, ep7). the movie it seems is geard towards \\\"millennials\\\" throwing tantrums will get your way\\, you no longer need to work hard and the list just goes on. I don't accept 8 as a starwars movie and probably will stop watching them. they could have done such a better job to honor the original trillogy but instead decided to slap us in the face.\\n\\nI would like to also mention after reading alot of the review\\, anything that is a 4star is probably a fake review trying to earn more ratings\\, its like the people never even watched the movie\\, no way would anyone in their right mind give this anything above a 2 and thats being insanely generous\\, everything else is just them trying to make it look like the movie wasnt realy that bad BUT IT IS THAT BAD!!!!","true":true}
