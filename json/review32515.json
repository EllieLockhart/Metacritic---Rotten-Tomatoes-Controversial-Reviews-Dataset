Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi added a different element this franchise desperately needed. Many complain that it is too different from the original trilogy\\, but yet they don't want it to be like the original trilogy. People need to make up their minds with what they want and just be thankful we get to see another Star Wars movie and let's be thankful we get to see Star Wars movies as part of the norm now. Great movie. Super different. Few flaws\\, but can be overlooked. May the Force be with you","true":true}
