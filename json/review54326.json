Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life and during a childhood that was often filled with unhappiness\\, the franchise was a wonderfully exciting bit of escapism. I could not count how many times I sat through the original (A New Hope) in the movie theater. As the franchise went on and Lucas tinkered with improved sound and updated special effects\\, I was often irritated\\, but my love for the universe Lucas created was unshaken. When the prequels came out\\, I heard the criticisms and could certainly understands some of them\\, but the overall story of how the Empire was built and how Anikin descended into evil and madness I found to be compelling and true to the Lucas universe. \\n    I am not averse to something new. I absolutely loved Rouge One and rate it amongst the best of the Star Wars movies. After seeing The Force Awakens\\, I did my best to get past the blatant theft in the plot from previous SW movies\\, which was no easy task. It seemed to have been written and produce by people who were not fans and didn't understand the mythos of the franchise. It was not good. But I pushed past it\\, hoping that the complaints had been heard and things would be put right in The Last Jedi. \\n   I can't recall wanting to like a movie this much. But I didn't. I more that didn't like it. I was angered by it. Beyond the poor direction\\, the disjointed plot\\, the flat and mistimed attempts at humor\\, the introduction of meaningless and shallow characters and the meandering story\\, I was forced to watch as a mythology and characters that I have loved for decades were redefined\\, undermined and outright destroyed. \\n  I get that new directions are often needed. The beauty of the Star Wars universe is that it offers endless potential stories to tell.  But I watched Luke\\, Leia\\, Yoda\\, and everything that made Star Wars what it was disrespected and destroyed. \\n   I own every Stat Wars movie and have spent countless hours watching them repeatedly. I will not buy the Last Jedi\\, will never watch it again and will do my best to convince myself that it never existed.\\n\\n   If there is a way to salvage this\\, I just don't see it.","true":true}
