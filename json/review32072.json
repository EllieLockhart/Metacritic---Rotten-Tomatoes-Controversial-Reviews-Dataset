{"101487":169493,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers.....\\n\\n\\n\\nWho was Snoke? Why did he die in the middle of a speech about how what was about to happen could never happen? Who was the man on the Island pretending to be Luke Skywalker? How can Snoke bend time and space with the force\\, to allow Rey and Kylo Ren to speak\\, but die so easily?  Why didn't Snoke Bitch slap Fake Luke Skywalker into the sea with his mind\\, given that he must know where Fake Luke Skywalker is at this point\\, and can attack people by telepathy remotely? How come Princess Leya can survive a hard vacuum\\, and fly in space?  Why did the bombs fall on the dreadnought even though there was no planet to create the gravity?  Why is the Dark-side of the force represented by a dodgy mirror in a blowhole cave?  Why did Fake Luke Skywalker do such a bad job of pretending to be Real Luke Skywalker? Does Fake Luke Skywalker not know that Real Luke Skywalker is a hero and would never set out to kill Kylo Ren\\, his nephew? Why did Fake Luke Skywalker force hologram himself into a secret rebel mountain fortress to lightsaber duel Kylo Ren\\, thus avoid being killed\\, only to die of exhaustion? When the First Order were chasing the rebel fleet at slower than light speeds\\, why didn't they send 10\\,000 tie fighters after the rebels rather than slowly following them in their main ships? Why didn't  Leia Poppins just blast a hole out of the mountain to leave by? Why didn't they auto-pilot the rebel ships they were going to loose at light-speed into the massive enemy ships\\, given that they flew the last one in manually and wiped out half the FO fleet? Why did Fasma just show up and then die? Who the hell was Fasma? Why aren't all storm troopers in armour like hers?  Why did Fasma specifically find the longest method of killing her captives possible? How come Snoke has the galaxy's largest space ship?  Why didn't the vice admiral tell anyone what her plan was\\, but instead appear to lead everyone to their deaths\\, and then act surprised when someone mutinied to try and do something.  Where were the Knights of Ren? Why have they made Rey \\\"force God\\\" (the dark-side of the force shows her that she is the embodiment of the Light side of the force)? Why did Luke Skywalker travel to the first Jedi Temple in order to be replaced by Fake Luke Skywalker who jokes about never having read the half a dozen books in the temple because meh? Why was Fake Luke Skywalker surprised that people turned up to elicit the help or Real Luke Skywalker\\, given that Real Luke Skywalker left a cryptic map to the planet with the 'rebels'?  Why are the rebels\/resistance called the rebels\/resistance\\, given that the First Order are the remnants of the Empire; surely the rebels are just the Navy\/Army of the legitimate government?  If not then what are the actual legitimate governments doing about the first Order?  How come the Force ghost of Yoda has the power of Thor for no reason\\, and uses it to destroy the first Jedi Temple?\\n\\nIn no particular order those were some of the many questions the film left me with.  Visually nice\\, good special effects\\, a couple of half decent fight scenes\\, OK music.  Worthless plot\\, stupid characters. Luke Skywalker was a completely different character\\, Leia has sporadic super powers\\, Snoke gets cut in half comically\\, and Admiral Aqbar died.  Oh and all of the white men are 'toxic masculine' figures who are bumbling idiots who need to shut the fuck up and get out of the way and let Women (who are superior) do the job.  Don't bother with Disney Star wars any more\\, its a trap for the nostalgic.","true":true}
