Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars yet!  No one asks for a director to pander to fan boy predictions ect. But watching this film I couldn't help but feel that the original cast deserved better. As for the new trilogy Rian will be making\\, I wont be watching. E 1-7 were good. but 8\\, I doubt I'll watch the 9th now. Disgusting.","true":true}
