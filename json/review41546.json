Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is entertaining and is little more\\, awful characters\\, over-reliance on CG\\, pandering\\, bad scenes\\, mediocre pacing\\, and many many more issues make this movie quite the upset for a Star Wars fan. There's some enjoyment to be had but\\, this movie is nothing special or very good.","true":true}
