Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just so great. I was really worried about this movie living up to the The Force Awakens\\, but Rian Johnson wrote an amazing script. No wonder JJ was jealous that he didn't get to direct it. At no point was the film predictable. The throne room scene is the best moment in Star Was history. Just an amazing sequence. There are so many great moments for old fans. R2's moment with Luke and of course Yoda. BRAVO!\\n\\nStar Wars is in great hands with RIan Johnson being a creative partner. So much love and care went into making this film. I highly recommend the documentary about how the film was made. We're so lucky that this film turned out so well.","true":true}
