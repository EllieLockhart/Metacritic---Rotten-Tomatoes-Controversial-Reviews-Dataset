Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was full of issues that had nothing to do with Star Wars\\, but the Star Wars issues put the nail in the rather large coffin. The terrible jokes take you of the movie. They try to make you laugh at Hux who screamed his lungs out before destroying a star system when there is nothing funny or should be nothing funny about him. Rose is a grown up Ep. 1 Anakin with her terrible lines and too many times did nothing make any sense at all.It's fine to throw some twists and turns into your movie\\, but when the Force Awakens sets up these questions and instead of answering any of them you flip the fans the bird\\, and then do what you did to other characters and give the double deuce\\, it's terrible. Rian Johnson clearly wanted to make his legacy film. He took a shot and it has failed miserably. Saw it once and that may have been too many times.","true":true}
