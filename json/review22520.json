Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start by saying that I freaking love Star Wars...all of them\\, the old ones and the new ones\\, the cartoons and the comics. I loved The Force Awakens but unfortunately...I hated The Last Jedi. I went in with 3 questions and left with 100 questions. At times there were scenes that had no purpose or reason to be there (Finn going for the tracker)\\, the acting was either bad or mediocre\\, there was too much talking and not a lot of action. I was really looking forward for a good Jedi scene and left with disappointment. For all that talking there was certainly no questions answered: is that really who Rey\u2019s parents were? Who was Snoke? Why was he killed? Wasn\u2019t he the Supreme Leader? What happen to the Knights of Ren? Why in the heck would you kill Luke when he just got in!? Who the heck is that kid at the end? The story was super confusing\\, I\u2019m not sure if they can recover. They had a good chance for a good fight scene but was mediocre by luke warm light saver action\\, I really miss the fight scenes from Episode 1\\,2 and 3. Action was bad\\, too much talking\\, bad acting\\, bad story line\\, more questions to answer...I really hope they can recover from this.","true":true}
