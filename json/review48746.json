Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I've ever seen. Disney and Co took everything I loved and grew up with as a kid and threw it in the paper shredder. Enormous plot holes and they turned my favorite character into a whiny Hillary Clinton. Get your capes ready because apparently people can unconsciously fly like Superman too. I have nothing against hiring ethnically diverse cast as long as the characters are interesting and the actors are competent\\, but Rose and Finn are horrid. Same with that DJ idiot lisp","true":true}
