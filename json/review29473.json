Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has ruined Star Wars. I'ld rather watch the prequel series that I now have a new appreciation for. The force awakens was alright but The Last Jedi does it no justice. Shame on disney for allowing this franchise to go down this way.","true":true}
