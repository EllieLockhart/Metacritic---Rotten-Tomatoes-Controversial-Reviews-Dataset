Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is a long running classic series that can fit into all genres and appeal to all people\\, but there's been one key genre Star Wars had touched on but not fully incorporated: comedy.  In The Last Jedi\\, the more prominent use of comedy throughout the movie serves to lighten the heavy plot that otherwise would've just been a sequence of intense battle scenes.  Many have criticized this choice to include more comedic moments in this movie\\, because it doesn't stick to the original style or feel of older Star Wars movies.  I would agree it's not the same\\, but I think it doesn't detract from the movie\\, but rather improves it.\\n\\n*******Spoilers Below*********\\n\\nThe comedy already showed little bit of a Disney spin on the classic Star Wars style\\, but the most Disney thing about the movie was the message at the end: the force is within everyone.  In the closing scene we see the small farm stable boy as he makes a broom move into his hand using the force and stares up at the sky.  This boy continues a message set up for earlier within the movie with Rey.  Rey\\, as we find out during the movie isn't of any great Jedi family dissent but is a regular person who had horrible parents.  She's a nobody\\, but she's able to be this amazing Jedi and change the world.  This is telling kids that there background doesn't matter and anyone can be anything\\, even a Jedi\\, because the force (or the ability become whatever we want) is inside all of us.  This is a very Disney theme that we find in many of their movies\\, and helps leave a positive ending on this dark and heavy movie.\\n\\nI personally really enjoyed the movie\\, but upon reflection there was one thing that lowered the movie's status a little bit for me.  At one point in the movie\\, Vice Admiral Holdo puts the resistance's last ship into hyperdrive and goes right through the empires' ship\\, completely destroying it.  For many\\, this has brought up the question of why the resistance didn't do this before if they could destroy an entire empire ship with a small hyperdrive capable ship. This brings up a good point\\, and that's why this movie loses a star\\, because though this may seem like I'm knit picking a little\\, this doesn't make sense and hasn't really been explained by the franchise-and most likely won't be explained by the franchise.","true":true}
