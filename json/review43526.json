Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was deliberate vandalism. I entered the theater ready to explain to the \\\"haters\\\" why they just didn't understand this film. I walked out just feeling sick. Rian Johnson is one sick individual. Kathleen Kennedy's only job was to protect this property from people like him. Disney just killed their golden goose.","true":true}
