Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie in the franchise. Just like an abusive relationship\\, I keep going back to it and keep getting hurt. The deus ex machina factor was over the top - every time they were in inescapable trouble\\, something unexpected happens to save the day. They kept the tradition of stealing scenes from previous films (Snokes throne room and the final battle scenes were virtually the same as the Emperors throne room in Jedi and the Hoth battle in Empire. This movie makes Phantom Menace feel like an academy award winning movie.","true":true}
