Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really enjoyable film which certainly had its flaws\\, though most of those seemed to come through less from the film itself and more from the heavy marketing of certain characters","true":true}
