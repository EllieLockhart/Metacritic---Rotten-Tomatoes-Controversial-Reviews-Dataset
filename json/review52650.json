Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All of the grandeur\\, all of the emotion\\, all of the gravitas seen in the original Star Wars trilogy is conspicuously absent here:\\n\\nThe worst Star Wars film (so far).\\n\\nWhen I heard this film was 2.5 hours long I was thrilled\\, at the thought of all of the great things it would bring. But it brought nothing positive at all.\\n\\nThe story\\, set up in The Force Awakens has been ignored mostly\\, or its been treated in a really negative and subversive way.\\n\\nIt leaves no investment for Episode 9. None. And this is allegedly part 2 of a trilogy. But it doesn't advance the story\\, apart from one character (but only just).\\n\\nI am really disappointed.","true":true}
