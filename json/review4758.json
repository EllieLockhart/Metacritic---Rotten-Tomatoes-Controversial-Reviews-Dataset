Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely loved it! My favorite Star Wars in years! I think there must be a concerted effort to jimmy the audience numbers here because I cannot imagine only 56% of the actual audience liked it.","true":true}
