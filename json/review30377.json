Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seen all these negative reviews and created a new account to add some positive thoughts. This movie wasn't perfect\\, but it was a cool new StarWars movie with many new ideas\\, which I'm looking forward to see again.\\n\\nDon't mind all these haters.","true":true}
