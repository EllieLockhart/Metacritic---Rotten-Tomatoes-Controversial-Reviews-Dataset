Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, and I'm including the Ewok movies and the Holiday Special in that list.\\n\\nA movie without any heroes\\, that systematically tears down the heroes of childhood\\, driven by the absurd wish by a purple haired cat lady to keep her plan for the survival of the rebellion a secret\\, doesn't merit any respect at all.\\n\\nForget this movie. I wish I could.","true":true}
