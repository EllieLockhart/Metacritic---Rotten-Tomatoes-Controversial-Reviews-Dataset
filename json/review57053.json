Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is so disappointing for any Star Wars fan. It completely devalues the most cherished of characters from the original trilogies and fails to inspire development  of the new. It also undoes all the promising plot development that was generated in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nI am a chilhood fan\\, but also a realist. I know that Disney cannot hold onto the past forever and that the franchise needs to grow into something new eventually. However\\, The Last Jedi conducts this change in such an insensitive way towards the original series and gives traditional fans little to look forward to. If Disney thinks it can survive on a new generation of fans to support its new vision it is sadly mistaken.\\n\\nIn many ways The Last Jedi should have been Episode 9. The latest trilogy should have been concerned with the rivival of the franchise (Which the Force Awakens began to do)\\, with the original characters bridging the gap from old to new. The Last Jedi is one episode too early. It hasn't given time for any characters\\, both old and new\\, to tell their stories properly. It's a rushed episode that takes the franchise in a direction that doesn't have the support of the fans. Rian Johnson showed small glimmers of potential for his future trilogy in this film\\, but he will never create a fan loved trilogy based upon the numerous weak plotlines that plagues The Last Jedi.","true":true}
