Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the \\\"Last Jedi\\\" was an insult to my childhood. I'm glad this film came out because it made me like the prequels again. Many people complain about small things in this movie which is understandable\\, but the plot was the dumbest movie plot I have ever seen before in my life. No this isn't a politically motivated rating. I was a Star Wars fan since I was four years old. FOUR! Thank you Disney for taking a dump on my childhood. Rian Johnson underestimates how big the Star Wars universe is. The Force is not strong with this movie. Star Wars has gone to the Dark Side.","true":true}
