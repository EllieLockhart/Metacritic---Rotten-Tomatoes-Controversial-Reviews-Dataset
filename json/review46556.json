Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching the Last Jedi is a painful experience\\, horribly written\\, horribly acted\\, almost as if the director had never seen a Star Wars film before. The story is ludacris and a tragic waste of the Luke Skywalker character. What a shame\\, worst Star Wars film ever.","true":true}
