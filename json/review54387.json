Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't think I can overstate my disappointment in this film.\\nI'm not sure exactly what the \\\"top critics\\\" on this site were thinking when they gave it a 93% certified fresh rating (down from about 96% I think it was)\\, or if there were even thinking at all assuming they weren't simply bought to give the movie a high approval rating in the hopes of boosting box office revenue as much as possible.\\n\\nIt failed at every twist and turn it tried to take the audience on\\, blundering its way through the entire film\\, hitting us squarely across the face with pointless and unnecessary slapstick comedy that ultimately demeaned several characters\\, it felt more like The Phantom Menace for much of the film than it did The Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nIt did at least try to be different by not following Empire Strikes Back in the same way that its predecessor\\, The Force Awakens\\, had followed A New Hope\\, but ultimately the effort was fruitless.\\n\\nSo many characters we cared about or wanted to care about were tragically mishandled\\, and the characters we didn't care about were painfully overexposed.\\n\\nOne of the worst films in the whole franchise\\, floating down in the dregs with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
