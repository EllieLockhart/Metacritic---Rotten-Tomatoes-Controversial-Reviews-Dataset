We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a huge fan of the first game\\, it breaks my heart to write this. I can't express how disappointed I am with this game. The graphics\\, and game play were great\\, but I was here for a great story and it fell flat on it's face. Everything with Ellie was great\\, and the story was advancing beautifully... and than I had to control Abby? The person who killed Joel? The person who I've been trying to kill for over a dozen hours? Am I supposed to emphasize with her\\, because I didn't. The entire story portion of the Abby story was awful and everything felt unbelievably forced. The ending had no resolution... zero. Ellie travels across the country\\, giving up her girlfriend and \\\"son\\\" and doesn't kill Abby? Zero resolution. I spent 25 hours for nothing essentially. Joel was dead and Abby was alive in the first 2 hours of the game\\, and at the end it was the same exact thing. I don't know what Naughty Dog was thinking. Maybe they wanted to try to be \\\"deep\\\"\\, but this has been a huge disappointment for me\\, all due to extremely poor story telling. I am going to delete this from my system and pretend like it doesn't exist. The first game was a masterclass in both game play and story telling\\, and while the game play was top notch\\, fans of the first should not be able to get over how poorly the story was told in this. They said they would not make DLC and now I'm happy about that. I hope they let this series go because it's a shame what they did to it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
