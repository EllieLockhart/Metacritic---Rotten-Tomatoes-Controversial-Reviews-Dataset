Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a Star Wars fan don't waste your time.  The whole movie is full of poor acting\\, bad writing\\,  lack of character relationship development.  Rey and Kylo Ren do well\\, but the rest remind me of when they introduced Jar Jar Binks into the cast.  It's a true disappointment and a fails to deliver a film that is worthy of the original Star Wars franchise.  It's a made for DVD movie.  At this point it should be allowed to die before it completely ruins the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
