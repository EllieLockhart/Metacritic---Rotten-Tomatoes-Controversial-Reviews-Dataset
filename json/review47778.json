Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When you whine about George Lucas raping your childhood\\, when you cry for Star Wars to be put in someone else's hands\\, you get The Last Jedi. I hope all of the people that trolled Lucas for years are happy now. Look what you've created\\, an abomination. Ironically\\, it's the same people that ripped Lucas and the prequels apart that are now crying for Lucas' return and this movie stricken from canon. Quick review.......Rian Johnson really doesnt know jack about Star Wars\\, or understand how the Star Wars formula works. He doesn't understand what makes these films tick. He doesn't understand the force\\, or the Jedi\\, or Luke Skywalker. For a guy that is a self proclaimed Star Wars nerd he really came out of this looking completely ignorant on the subject. The film is so incoherent and such a mess that even the worst prequel film looks superior. Disney's lack of confidence in The Last Jedi has now resulted in the return of JJ Abrams to \\\"rescue\\\" Star Wars and bring back the fans. Which means another fan service film. We can expect a rip off of Return of the Jedi. I think if I were going to pick up the phone and call anyone to save the franchise it would be the creator himself. No matter what some may say\\, I think Lucas should be heavily involved in some capacity.","true":true}
