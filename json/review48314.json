Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why people still defend this garbage movie is beyond me. This movie enjoyed destroying the Star Wars universe\\, from Leia flying in space (after being exposed to a hard vacuum for several minutes) to Holdo using a tactic which changes space combat forever. Next time the rebels will simply go into hyperspace at the Death Star MK4. Conclusion: Avoid like the plague.","true":true}
