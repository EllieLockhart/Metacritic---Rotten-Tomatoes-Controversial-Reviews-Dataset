Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A comparison of Palpatine and Snoke\\n\\nEpisode IV: \\\"The Emperor has dissolved the Galactic Senate.\\\" Not actually a character. Obiwan talks of Vader being an apprentice that was seduced by the dark side. No mention of a seducer.\\n \\nEpisode VII: Snoke's voice is in the trailers\\, the character is reviled by the Organa-Solo clan for turning Ben and destroying the order\\, he is known to have taken over the Imperial Remnant and turned it into the First Order\\, and he is shown as a hologram directing both Kylo and Hux. He discusses a balance of the light and dark sides of the Force. He also recalls Kylo to finish his training\\, so we know that he's a master as well as an evil influence.\\n\\nEpisode V: Palpatine tells Vader via hologram that Luke is dangerous\\, but would become a powerful ally of turned to the dark side. Now we know the emperor seduced Vader... and nothing else. \\n\\nEpisode VI: Palpatine conspires with Vader to turn Luke\\, who we now know is Vader's son. Palpatine then orchestrates a confrontation between Luke and Vader\\, hoping to replace Vader with a younger and more powerful apprentice\\, and encouraging Luke to finish off Vader after the fight. When Luke refuses\\, Palpatine uses force lightning as a weapon and is then killed by Vader as a final act of redemption.\\n\\nEpisode VIII: Snoke is shown punishing Hux\\, connecting Rey and Kylo through the Force\\, torturing Rey\\, and gloating about his absolute power... before being unceremoniously killed without a fight.\\n\\nWith Emperor Palpatine\/Darth Sidious\\, there is a gradual building of the character's importance and a final confrontation in which we actually see his character fighting against his former apprentice. \\n\\nWith Snoke\\, we're giving much more information up front\\, informed of his central role in Kylo's fall and the First Order's rise in the first movie\\, and then given nothing else. He's unceremoniously killed without mounting any kind of defense and his death serves no purpose in developing any other characters. Rey learns no insights into her past\\, Ben is not redeemed\\, and essentially nothing changes for Hux or the First Order. The Supreme Leader is dead\\, long live the Supreme Leader. Snoke is bad storytelling. The new Star Wars trilogy is the theatrical equivalent of How I Met Your Mother\\, as it stands.","true":true}
