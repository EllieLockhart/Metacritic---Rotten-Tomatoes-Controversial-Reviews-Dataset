Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie seemed like it was trying to do everything a Star Wars fan would hate. It also suffered greatly from no time jump between it and the last movie; by the end you're practically where you left off at the end of episode 7 except your favorite hero is dead","true":true}
