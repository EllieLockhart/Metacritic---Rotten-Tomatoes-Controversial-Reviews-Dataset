Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things I like in TLJ for so many reasons\\, from the big turns of events to the small little moments.\\n\\nAnd one small little moment is when Luke is teaching Rey about the force by letting her reach out and feel her surroundings\\, it eventually leads to ...a force. It's \\\"the\\\" force but because she narrates what she feels as she goes she says \\\"a force\\\" (I imagine) just the millisecond before it dawns on her\\, \\\"ahh\\, of course\\, THE force\\\".\\n\\nAnd it's so perfect because they went with \\\"A\\\" force\\, we really get to discover the force with Rey. If she said THE force it wouldn't give the same sense of discovery\\, it would feel more casual like \\\"yup\\, and the force between it all\\\".\\n\\nIt's such a beautiful moment and I love that Rian & co paid such attention to little subtle details like that.","true":true}
