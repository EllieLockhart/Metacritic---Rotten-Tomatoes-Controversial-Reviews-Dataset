Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming. More holes in the plot than in a hooker's stockings. \\nLifelong Star Wars fan (not the prequels) and I feel that this movie and also The Force Awakens\\, are totally disregarding what the heros of Star Wars\\, Empire and Jedi had accomplished. \\nFor the first time in my life\\, I'm not looking forward to the next Star Wars movie. \\nStar Wars is now officially dead.","true":true}
