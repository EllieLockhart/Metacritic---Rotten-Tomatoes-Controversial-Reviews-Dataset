Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, if you have not seen the movie\\, ignore any reviews saying that it was terrible. Don't go into the theater with a disinterest just because the internet says so. To me\\, this was a great movie. Spoilers ahead. The Last Jedi has received mixed reviews due to everyone being mad that their fan theories weren't true. We don't truly find out who Rey's parents are\\, Kylo doesnt turn good. Rey doesn't turn bad. We don't get to find out who Snoke is or where he came from before Kylo kills him. I understand some of the frustration\\, however\\, I believe some if the plot holes will be filled with the next movies. People don't see exactly what they expected and freak out. I honestly don't understand most of the hate. Be patient my young Padawans. The answers will come.","true":true}
