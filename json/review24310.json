Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Might as well rename this \\\"Star Wars for Millenials: Part 2\\\". The Force Awakens had very little originality and this film echos that lack of higher brain function.  \\\"Hey! We're lazy\\, throw temper tantrums when we don't get our ways\\, we have no originality (so we're going to essentially copy everything that's already been done)\\, we have no patience for development and we don't care if there's a side story or two that could actually be interesting and build on the plot.\\\"  Oh!  And let's kill off any reason for the founding fan base to give two craps about what happens next.  An excellent study on how to make some money on a name and destroy a legacy.","true":true}
