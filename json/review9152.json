Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun movie\\, but I can't get over the glaring plot holes\\, bad character development and the horrible storyline they created for Luke.\\nGood CGI\\, action\\, and Kylo is a little less of an emo youth.  The scenes with Kylo and Rey worked probably the better than everything else in the movie.  I also didn't mind the humor. It hits more than it misses. It will only bother you if you don't want to laugh in a SW movie.\\n\\nCritics either don't understand Star Wars or are way to nice to Disney properties to give this over 90%","true":true}
