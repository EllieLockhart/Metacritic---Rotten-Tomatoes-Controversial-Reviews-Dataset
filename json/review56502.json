Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakes was no masterpiece\\, but it was a respectable foundation upon which to build the new Disney trilogy. It gave us characters and a plot that were intrinsically interesting while remaining tonally consistent and universe-compliant with existing Star Wars media and canon. Despite this\\, Rian Johnson went out of his way to jarringly write himself out of the expectations audiences audiences had been given\\, and into a new direction entirely. A direction that does not work\u2014neither as a follow up to The Fore Awakens\\, as a work within the Star Wars continuity\\, nor as a competently wrought film in its own right. The humor is tone-deaf and flippant; the characters are confused; the universe is unrecognizable; the cinematic language is foreign and inconsistent with the history of the series. My honest opinion is that Rian Johnson was neither fluent enough in Star Wars nor experienced enough a writer\/director to be trusted with such an important franchise. I don't think he is a bad person or that he in any way meant to deliver a disappointment\\, but that is what we got.","true":true}
