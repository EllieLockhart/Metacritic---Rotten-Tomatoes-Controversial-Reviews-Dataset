Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are those who hate this film because it's \\\"filled with SJWs\\\". This is not one of those reviews.\\n\\nAfter seeing The Force Awakens\\, I was interested. It was a rebuild of ep 4\\, with a splash of 5 thrown in. OK\\, so it's a 200m$ fan film. That's fine\\, we're doing a reboot I guess. But I had a caveat- with all the questions that were opened my the infamous mystery box director\\, then the next movie(s) really need to step up to the plate\\, and give us answers. \\n\\nThat didn't happen. Nothing gets answered. And the answers you do get are so incredibly underwhelming you'll be in disbelief. I was disappointed in the climatic light-saber fight scene. That's bad.","true":true}
