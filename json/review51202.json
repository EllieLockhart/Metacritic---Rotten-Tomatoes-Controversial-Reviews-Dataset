Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely Loved it.  The more I think about it\\, the more I enjoy and respect what Rian has done here.  I understand some of the negative comments (that are not ridiculous).  I see how Luke ended up being a disgruntled and eccentric hermit\\, wait for it\\, like Yoda.  The movie does not detract from the Force Awakens and is true to its characters.  What the movie does is answer some questions in a way that no one else expected.  If you cant get past that\\, I dont know what to tell you.  I didnt want to see a movie I have already seen before.  4.5\/5","true":true}
