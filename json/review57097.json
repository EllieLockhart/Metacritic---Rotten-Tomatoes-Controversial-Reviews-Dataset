Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a mixed bag\\, with both good and bad elements. But these primarily permeate the story as it is personal preference\\, however the technical aspects of this movie is some of the best in all of Star Wars\\, the amount of practical effects is stellar without heavily clashing with the uses of cgi\\, which in of itself look amazing. The camera work is also to be commended due to the variety and unique use of shots throughout the film. The acting is top tier and the best of any Star Wars movie to date\\, while there is some clumsy dialogue every Star Wars film has that and it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s not as annoying here.\\n\\nThis film is hit or miss for many people\\, with a decisive story and character moments\\, not to mention that this is the longest Star Wars film to date can exhaust many people\\, for me the good far out weighs the bad here. I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)ve not been on the edge of my seat not knowing what was going to happen for a long time and I hope this continues for Star Wars moving forward and not just reverting to formulaic predictable fan service.\\n\\nIf you havent 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t seen this movie\\, its 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s worth a watch and worth formulating your own opinion on the movie\\, as the hyperbole around this movie is insane at this point.","true":true}
