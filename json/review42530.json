Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an abomination. Too late to start over\\, so I hope JJ can pull a rabbit out of his hat for E9. TFA was flawed and completely unoriginal\\, but at least it felt more like SW than TLJ.  Hopefully KK steps down and RJ never directs another film the rest of his life.  One this for sure\\, I won't be paying to see E9 unless heads roll immediately.","true":true}
