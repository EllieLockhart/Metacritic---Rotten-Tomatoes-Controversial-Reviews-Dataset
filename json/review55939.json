Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson managed to take whatever interesting foundation TFA laid and toss it to the side\\, treating it as irrelevant. It was hard to care about the big picture. It makes the struggle and journey our heroes in all the previous films seem for nothing. The films major theme seems to be that nothing matters and nothing has any lasting meaning. Star Wars is a space-opera\\, it's not supposed to be a reflection into real life. People love Star Wars because its about a small group fighting for whats right against a terrible evil. And this film makes sure that it was all for nothing. History just repeats itself. I have loved every Star Wars film to date\\, this was the first time I was disappointed. It was like a break up. This is not the Star Wars I love and have cherished. The magic struggles to remain. Rian has also done a good job ensuring that Episode 9 has no where to go except being the third remake of A New Hope. Very disappointed.","true":true}
