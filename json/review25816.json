{"101487":157275,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOTE: Apparently RottenTomatoes doesnt count 1\/2 star or zero star ratings\\, make sure you give this movie ONE STAR to be counted. There is something REALLY fishy going on with the reviews on this movie. Disney is DEFINITELY paying or influencing the reviews. MAKE YOUR VOICE COUNT AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.\\n \\nReview of Social Justice Wars : The Last Mary Sue & the Diversity Crew:\\n\\nI remember watching The Phantom Menace as a 17 year old when it first came out and thinking \\\"wow\\, there is no way any future Star Wars movie could possibly be worse than this\\\".\\n\\nBut the universe\\, in all its infinite wisdom & patience\\, just laughed\\, and nearly 18 years later\\, an took the older\\, wearier\\, and more tired version of me and subjected him to this abortion of a film.\\n\\nWhere to begin? let me try to go in order:\\n\\n1) Opening space battle: despite losing the Death Stars to small fighters\\, and having fought the Rebellion for 30+ years\\, the First Orders commanders are utterly unprepared when a single fighter manages to sneak past their big canons and severly damage their biggest dreadnought. Snoke was apparently unaware his capital ship\\, that he is on\\, now has a device that can track the Rebel fleet through hyperspace. Apparently the Galaxy Far Far away does not bother with gravity and vacuum\\, as the Rebel bombers literally \\\"drop\\\" bombs \\\"down\\\" in space. And the only way to release said bombs is with a remote control\\, one that is easily dropped\\, lost\\, or fumbled. Poe made a prank call to open up the movie.... HILARIOUS right!??\\n\\n2) Plot : what\\, in the name of all that is holy\\, was the point of that IDIOTIC Finn\/Asian chick side quest? Not only did the out of place Casino planet fee straight out of a James Bond movie and UTTERLY took me out of the film (tuxedos\\, dice\\, popular Earth gambling games\\, etc)\\, the entire side quest was COMPLETELY POINTLESS and served no purpose other than to give the two minority characters something to do. And when the hell did Rose fall in love with Finn? In the in-universe few HOURS they were together? Also according to the #MeToo movement\\, isnt Rose kissing Finn while he was almost passed out now considered \\\"Sexual Assault\\\"? Imagine if Finn did that to Rose? And if the whole quest was to get in contact with a super rare Code Breaker (too bad they don't have R2 D2)\\, what are the chances they would just HAPPEN to be locked in with an equally competent code breaker just in time to escape together? \\n\\n3) Excessive SJW\/Feminist\/Political correctness. If I walk into a room and theres me (middle eastern)\\, an African American\\, an Asian\\, a Jew\\, and a gay person (all mixed genders)\\, great! No problem. Its when its artificially shoved down our throats and forced that it becomes an issue. Rose has no reason for existing other that to have an Asian character and fill in the diversity quota. She adds exactly zero to the plot and her removal would make no difference what so ever. Admiral Holdo is\\, in the most ham fisted literal sense\\, the purple haired\\, physical manifestation of modern day toxic feminism. She literally has purple hair\\, and her entire purpose to is put the \\\"mansplaining\\\" hot shot Poe in his place and to show that\\, despite her being completely and utterly stupid and irrational by any standard\\, she really isn't at all\\, and that this proves that all women really are rational\\, even when they are not. And its just men keeping them down! Speaking of which\\, apparently all competent leaders in this new Star Wars are women\\, and all the bumbling\\, incompetent ones are white stuffy men.\\n\\n4) The \\\"hyperspace ram\\\" scene. Oh my god this single scene just made the entire Star Wars saga completely and utterly irrelevant:\\n\\nA New Hope: \\\"Sir\\, we just analyzed the Death Star plans and devised a risky assault plan....\\n\\\"Just hyperspace ram it\\\"\\nESB: \\\"Sir\\, our troops are assembled and ready to commence the ground assault against the Rebel base....\\\"\\n\\\"Just hyperspace ram the Shield Generator\\, then hyperspace ram the Rebel base\\\"\\nReturn of the Jedi : \\\"Sir\\, the Death Star is just ahead and we are preparing our fleet to....\\\"\\n\\\"Just hyperspace ram the Death Star\\\"\\n\\\"But sir\\, its protected by an energy shield from the Forest Moon of Endor\\\"\\n\\\"Hyperspace Ram the Shield generator\\, then hyperspace ram the Death Star\\\"\\nRogue One: \\\"We have the Death Star plans\\, but we need to deactivate the shield in order to be able to transmit it to the....\\\"\\n\\\"Just hyperspace ram the shields until they are.... actually we can just hyperspace ram the Death Star anyways. I guess we dont need those plans after all\\, ok guys lets go home\\\"\\n\\nBesides directly making all of the above completely irrelevant\\, what happens in this new Disney Star Wars universe if a pilot falls asleep on the wheel and accidentally hyperspace rams a planet? What if he was checking his Twitter while piloting? or a disgruntled former employee? A terrorist?\\n\\nSpeaking of the Death Stars too\\, why build such an expensive space station when you can just strap on a hyperdrive to random asteroid and hyperspace it into a planet? Much more cost effective and same exact effect\\, no?\\n\\nFinally\\, why did \\\"Admiral\\\" Holdo wait until the very LAST REBEL ship to hyperspace ram the Capital ship of the New Order? She sacrificed like\\, what\\, a dozen Rebel ships before she apparently came up with that brilliant idea? I'm guessing the purple hair dye seeped into her brain\\, or maybe it was just the patriarchy holding her down. Who knows?\\n\\n5) Luke Skywalker. Now here is a man\\, who\\, at the tender young age of his early 20s\\, was plucked out of obscurity from a remote desert planet\\, and\\, despite everyone and their mothers telling him otherwise\\, decides that Darth Vader\\, the notorious mass murderer and the Emperor's right hand man\\, had some good in him\\, and he bravely went and confronted him not once\\, but TWICE. Where is this hero? Apparently broken and defeated because a barrel chested angsty teenager got a little mad at him\\, forcing him to abandon his friends\\, family\\, and all he has ever fought for and sulk like a coward milking some kind of space cows. Fruthermore\\, whats the point of the ghost projection at the end if he was going to die anyways? Why not go there as a man worthy of the Luke Skywalker legend? I have no problem with characters changing\\, thats fine. Its how the story teller TAKES that character there is what counts. To take someone like Luke and have him turn into a sulking coward\\, you have to EARN the right to that to him by exceptional story telling. \\n\\n6) Rey \\\"Mary Sue\\\". Please keep in mind that in the in-universe timeline\\, Mary Sue was\\, at best\\, a week removed from her escape from Jakku. In that short amount of time\\, somehow she manages to 1) defeat Luke skywalker in an impromptu melee\\, 2) Defeat Snoke's Elite bodyguards in a grossly over matched setting\\, 3) use the Force competently enough to defeat Kylo Ren\\, who has presumably been training since childhood\\, 4) and outfly trained TIE Fighter pilots\\, among many other super human feats. 5) Know how to swim.... after living her entire life on a desert planet. Anakin Skywalker\\, who was \\\"too old\\\" at 9 years old to even begin training\\, must be jealous. Luke\\, the son of the prodigal Anakin Skywalker\\, had to struggle to even move a lightsaber and spent months on a swamp planet with a dyslexic talking frog just to learn the basics of the Force\\, and got his hand chopped off for his efforts.\\n\\n7) The entire plot revolves around the FO fleet slowwwwly crawl up to the escaping Resistance fleet. First of all\\, why does light (laser beams) \\\"lose power\\\" over the distance of a few kilometers in vacuum? And since when do Star Wars ships \\\"use fuel\\\" when in the still canonical cross section books even the oldest Republic Era capital ships were powered by \\\"massive fusion generators that generate more power than a star\\\"? Just to serve a contrived and boring plot point and give a movie something to make it last 2 hours? Did the Death Star have to stop by a gigantic Chevron gas station in space on its way to blow up Alderaan? Hopefully Tarkin let the Stormtroopers use the bathrooms and grab some snacks real quick. Is Pablo Hidalgo still around to make sure consistency in the SW canon is maintained? Or is it now the \\\"Kathleen Kennedy **** show\\\"?\\n\\n8) The entire Resistance is apparently comprised of a few hundred people. For an entire galaxy of quintillion beings. Apparently the Resistance capital ships have a population density less than that of your average crack house. Just how 12 is Rian Johnson exactly? And why is the only way to send a message to their allies on that old Rebel base? no one has an iphone? They managed to contact Maz just fine before.\\n\\n8 ) Snoke.... why kill off the single most interesting new bad guy? Space Leia... why? The third leg on those Rebel speeds on the planet Crayt that create a very visually distinct red trail easily trackable by the enemy....why? The resistance keeping the base door open until the last second causing needless casualties....why? How did that Code breaker even know of the Rebel plans? Finn and Rose left before anyone even knew what the plans even were. Who told him? Who told Finn\/ Rose? Speaking of the Dynamic Diversity Duo\\, how did they manage to make it back to the Rebel base on Crayt so quickly\\, without getting shot at by the AT-AT walkers\\, once their speeders crashed? DOES THIS MOVIE EVEN STAY CONSISTENT TO ITS OWN SELF?\\n\\nThe entire existence of this movie\\, which removed any and all interesting characters and mysteries (Snoke\\, Reys parents\\, Luke\\, etc) introduced in Force Awakens. Why? What about the Knights of Ren\\, CLEARLY shown in the Force Awakens as being part of the destruction of Lukes Jedi Academy? The level of carelessness in constructing a coherent\\, consistent trilogy is astounding. I would not be surprised in the slightest if I found out Rian Johnson never even watched the Force Awakens\\, or at best was given a rough outline of what happened in it.\\n\\nIn short.... congratulations Universe. You win again.\\n\\nNot just the worst Star Wars movie ever\\, but honestly just one of the worst movies in general.\\n\\nRian Johnson is just an edgy douche bag who clearly enjoys taking what  he knows people like and expect and just going the complete opposite way just to be a contrarian jack ass\\, If that's all Disney wanted they could have just made Luke Skywalker be the leader of a group of space faring Force using Unicorns who are the reincarnated Jedi masters of the past and shoot lasers out of their horns. Even less people would have expected that so it HAS to be good\\, right?\\n\\nKathleen Kennedy is a well know hardcore feminist idiot. Now that old white dude Lucas is not the boss anymore\\, Kathleen is having  a field day shoving her toxic neo-feminist garbage down our throats.\\n\\nPlease don't support this film. Don't support Disney. They are the epitome of a soulless corporation that specializes in mass producing generic\\, unimaginative digital content and overcrowded\\, overpriced theme parts. They need to learn their lesson and not be the arrogant corporation they are\\, and go back to their roots. RT is not calculating the REAL scores of this film correctly. Its audience approval is WAY less than 49%\\, and the fake \\\"five star\\\" reviews are barely one or two sentences long. All the professional critics paid off or intimated by Disney are now exposed and will lose a TON of credibility in their future reviews.\\n\\nThis is just a MESS. It takes a special kind of idiot to be able to ruin an established franchise like Star Wars in such a way\\, and Rian Johnson is exactly that idiot.","true":true}
