Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointing plot\\, storyline\\, and character development. Worse than the Force Awakens and that was also terrible. Rogue One stands as the only good recent Star Wars film.","true":true}
