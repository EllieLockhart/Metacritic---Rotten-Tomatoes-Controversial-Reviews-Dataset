Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take off the Star Wars name and you get a lousy sci-fi film. Subversion is not an enjoyable way to take the franchise into a new direction. Same plot points (not creative)\\, subversive character motives (not creative). I hope they find enough new fans to replace the old ones.","true":true}
