Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After The Force Awakens\\, I was really excited to see how the story would develop.  Long story short... It fell completely flat!  The dialogue was cheesy to say the least\\, the action scenes were pretty good\\, but nothing we haven't seen in previous films.  My favorite part of the movie we're the little bird creatures in the cockpit with Chewy.  Bottom line\\, the storyline was overly drawn out.  For a 2 1\/2 hour long movie on IMAX 3D\\, I expected a lot more for $20 per ticket!  My advice\\, wait till it comes out on Netflix or Redbox!","true":true}
