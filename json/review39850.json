{"101487":181952,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-07","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very long film. At 152 minutes\\, it seems like a marathon. Movies are stretching the boundaries of time length. After trailers are added by the cinema\\, this can easily exceed 3 hours in length sitting inside of a theater. Movies with run times close to 3 hours need an intermission. Let us get up and go to the restroom at least. Anyway\\, let's get down to the meat of this review.\\n\\nI want to like this film. I really do. This film begins pretty much where The Force Awakens leaves off. So\\, if you haven't seen it recently or at all\\, see The Force Awakens first. With that said\\, there're lots of battles both in ship\\, with blasters and with lightsabers\\, but nothing really of consequence. This film typifies what's wrong with Hollywood writers. They have no vision. This problem is no more evident than in the stories that unfold in this romp. There are certainly lots of plot contrivances and save-the-day tropes\\, but nothing new or notable to see (or say) here. It doesn't expand on the universe in any new or exciting way. It just uses the universe and abuses all of its existing tropes\\, but never feels fresh\\, new or exciting.\\n\\nOf course\\, this is a middle film. So\\, it can't exactly resolve what was started\\, but it does its level best to make a dent in what will close out this trilogy. Unfortunately\\, this film is far too ambitious as well\\, trying to interweave too many side stories and not telling any on of them particularly well. There's the Poe-as-a-rebelious-officer thread. There's the Finn vs Nobody-mechanic love interest thread from out of nowhere. There's the Luke vs Rey thread. There's the Leia vs Poe thread. There's the Snoke vs Kylo vs Rey thread. There's the topsy-turvy Rey and Kylo force connection thread. There's the Millenium Falcon thread. There's the useless Moz Kanata thread. There's the new general who appears out of nowhere and gets killed thread. There's the Phasma vs Finn thread. There are even more than that. There's the Luke vs Kylo thread. There are far\\, far too many different story threads.\\n\\nThis story needed to be simplified\\, reduced and focused. This film was all over the place and\\, at the same time forcing it to cut too many corners to make ends meet. It's the typical Hollywood blockbuster writing team that cares less about making sense and more about writing too many threads and then cheating to close threads. It is\\, for example\\, killing off Luke\\, not in battle\\, but alone on a planet using some extraordinary force power he has never once exhibited before. It is tying Kylo to Rey with some kind of force connection that isn't explained and wasn't even hinted at in TFA. It's Poe and Rey and Finn all off on their own missions\\, not working together. It's Finn and Nobody-mechanic off on a mission to save the fleet.\\n\\nI'm torn. I want new original story ideas\\, but not like this. On the other hand\\, I'm almost now wanting copycat stories from the original trilogy because at least copying those formulas might actually work better than this disjointed romp. Let's hope that whomever they get to write the last installment can get their head out and actually produce a cohesive focused ending that makes more sense than these too many unnecessary and unfocused dead end threads in The Last Jedi.","true":true}
