Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolutely terrible. It has ruined Star Wars for me. Too much forced humor and bad timing. Story line is god awful. Killed off so many potential characters. Ridiculous antics played out. I'm deeply saddened on how they have managed to ruin what I grew up loving so much. I wish I never saw the film because I now feel different about Star Wars and I have nothing to look forward to in the future. I think they hit a point of no return. Sad day from a big fan. Save your money and screw Disney for allowing this to happen.","true":true}
