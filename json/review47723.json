Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When it comes to the Star Wars franchise\\, I may have been late to the game in terms of when I became a huge fan\\, but I see myself as being pretty well-versed in the core saga as of today. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the latest installment in this universe\\, and while it's easily the riskiest and most daring of the series\\, it also ranks among the best\\, at least in my opinion. I rarely do this\\, but I felt the need to see this movie twice before writing this review. Having a very solid memory of this eighth installment\\, here's why I believe it's one of the best in the franchise\\, but also why it may not be for everyone.\\n\\nAs I mentioned\\, this is a film that deserves multiple viewings in order to fully appreciate the routes it decides to take. The story itself is simple. The Resistance is being pursued by the First Order while Rey is off training with Luke Skywalker. Finn finds himself on a mission with newcomer Rose and the movie sets itself in motion. I'm keeping the plot ambiguous because this movie is truly an experience that needs to be seen with completely cold eyes. I feel as though certain elements will definitely catch people off guard though\\, so let's get the negatives out of the way.\\n\\nThere are some moments of comedy that really work here\\, just like they did in Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\, but there are also a few gags that fall completely flat upon first viewing\\, due to the fact that they feel jarring. Some of them are actually spoilers\\, so I'll just say that you should go into this film with an open mind and let the emotion\\, as well as the comedy\\, take you along for this epic journey.\\n\\nThere are side plots that will definitely not please everyone\\, but I find myself appreciating everything this movie had to offer in retrospect. It didn't play it safe like its predecessor and it brought its viewers into new territory\\, as well as diving deep into certain things you've wondered about since the very beginning of the saga. Aside from some of the jokes or risks taken throughout the movie\\, those feel like minor nitpicks when looking back on the movie as a whole.\\n\\nFor anyone who goes into this film hoping to see a great continuation for Rey\\, a fun ride with Finn\\, or to see Carrie Fisher or Mark Hamill deliver satisfying performances and character arcs\\, you'll be very pleased when walking out of this installment. In terms of character development\\, this movie has it all. On top of that\\, this movie has one of best third acts I've ever seen in a Star Wars movie to date.\\n\\nAlthough the pacing can seem daunting throughout the first act of the movie\\, it really just takes its precious time trying to invest you in this newfound territory that Star Wars has never explored before. Once the third act begins and the pace picks up\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is filled with so many satisfying surprises and memorable moments that I found myself in awe by the time the credits rolled.\\n\\nIn the end\\, yes\\, this movie feels very different from anything that's come before it\\, but when you're on the eighth installment in a franchise you kind of have to start taking risks\\, even if it means not pleasing everyone. Personally\\, I found this film to be rich in its cinematography\\, deep in terms of character development\\, exciting and surprising in terms of its action sequences and reveals\\, and although simplistic in its story\\, moving within its devotion to certain themes. While I don't think this will be remembered as the greatest Star Wars movie\\, it's a damn good one. If you're a fan or just want to just escape at the theatre\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi may just be the fix you need. Aside from a few nitpicks\\, I thought this movie was terrific.","true":true}
