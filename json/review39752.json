Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a horrible movie.  It is long and boring and filled with plot holes.  The acting was terrible. What makes it really sad is that these are all great actors. Why can't Gareth Edwards direct all Star Wars movies.  I did not like Force Awakens either and so this is it. I will not be seeing episode IX in the theater I will wait for blu ray to see that movie.","true":true}
