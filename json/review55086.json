Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like it I really did. I feel weird not liking it but I can't lie to myself just because it's Star Wars. It was disappointing to say the least. This to me wasn't Star Wars. Here's an abbreviated list of reasons I didn't like it... spaceball humor right from the start\\, Mary Poppins  Leah\\, grumpy coward Luke\\, Pointless Snoke\\, missed opportunity to have Leah command the ship and go out heroic\\, smokes crappy bland red lair\\, crappy arc between fin and that one forgettable chick\\, riding those goofy animal things\\, wooden acting in general\\, girl at the beginning kicking the ladder to get the detonator when she could have just climbed the ladder in the same amount of time and then miraculously catches it before falling\\, no real cool settings whatsoever\\, movie does not take its time to breath\\, nothing resolved whatsoever\\, zero twists\\, crappy matrix slow mo garbage...etc... completely forgettable. Saw the force awakens in theaters 5 times.saw this once and that will be it.","true":true}
