Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bots have lost theirs minds\\, this is a masterpiece. Epic moments\\, good laughs. Fisher and Hamill are simply awesome. The Star Wars saga may go on for the rest of our lives\\, but I doubt it ever equals this again. There is a lineage in this movie\\, and while we may see flashes of it in the future the force will never be as strong as it was with Luke and Leia and their performances in the first three and now here. An amazing feat for the two after a 30 year plus layoff\\, they will cast a long shadow.","true":true}
