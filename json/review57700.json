Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Undeserving of most backlash\\, The Last Jedi ties together themes of failure\\, regret\\, and moving forward in a way that divided many fans of the series.  Though I enjoyed it as a whole\\, it is not a perfect movie.  While Star Wars has always had moments of comic-relief in the films\\, The Last Jedi often uses forced humor to its detriment (eg: the prank call\\, the 4th or 5th use of the porgs\\, etc).  While I can appreciate The Last Jedi's aim to move beyond the shadow of previous Star Wars films\\, often by taking turns or making choices that are not as predictable to the series\\, it tends to over use this.  While I don't mind the story cutting some elements common in the films to make way for the new\\, I didn't appreciate the neglect for existing characters and relationships within the new trilogy (eg: Rey having great interactions with Luke and Kylo Ren\\, but none at all with most of the rest of the cast from Ep. 7\\, including still barely saying more than a sentence to Poe).  Overall a better experience than most fans claim\\, but I believe it will be more appreciated with age.","true":true}
