Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot\\, direction\\, spirit and humor in this movie did not align with the Star Wars universe and was generally bad.  The entire casino plot was meaningless and distracting.  Snoke's demise just seemed lazy.  Though Mark Hamil's portrayal of Luke was excellent the Luke character did not seem believable or consistent.  The humor in this movie seemed out of t place and though I occasionally laughed\\, I didn't feel like it fit the movie.  This is not a robo review\\, just a disappoint fan of all but one of the Star Wars movies.","true":true}
