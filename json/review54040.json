Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Iconic\\, epic\\, a journey of destruction and hope. Rian Johnson directed a movie full of surprises and great plot twists\\, this is how The Last Jedi gets the Star Wars franchise out the confort zone\\, it's great how deep and evolve this characters goes\\, it's amazing how this movie is build to provide endless possibilities to the future. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year. (5\/5)","true":true}
