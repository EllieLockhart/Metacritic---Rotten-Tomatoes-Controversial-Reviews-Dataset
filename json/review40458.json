Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first Star Wars movie I will not see a second tine in theaters.  It was that poorly made.   Rian Johnson should be fired.   Disney has destroyed a once great franchise with these atrocious movies.   Maybe Ron Howard can salvage one film\\, but Kathleen Kennedy needs to resign from her position.","true":true}
