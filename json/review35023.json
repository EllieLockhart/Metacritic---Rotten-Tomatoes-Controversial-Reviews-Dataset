Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first 1\/3 of the movie was prequel bad\\, the last 2\/3 was great. I think the critic score is way too high and the audience score is way too low. It\u2019s a solid movie but not a great movie. They took a lot of chances\\, which is fine... I guess. My big problems were cheesy jokes and bad dialogue + some unanswered questions that I have a feeling won\u2019t be answered. ","true":true}
