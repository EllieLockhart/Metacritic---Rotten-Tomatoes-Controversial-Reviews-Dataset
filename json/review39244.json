Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film gives so much depth to the explanation of the force. It really explores what the dark side and the light are. The visual effects can be enigmatic at times and the film is overall very creative. I dont know what the fans of force awakens who were unhappy with this  movie were hoping for. Another death star ???? this is by far the most original series has been since empire strikes back.","true":true}
