Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"93%?  Did the critics grow up in the 70s as I did?  I love SW - so much that I am willing to far more forgiving that I am of other movie franchises.  I didn't care for TFA\\, but after this - I have to say SW is over for me.  Long live the original trilogy\\, and the prequels - yes there were issues\\, but they still captured my imagination.","true":true}
