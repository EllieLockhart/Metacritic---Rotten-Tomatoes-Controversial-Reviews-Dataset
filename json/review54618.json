Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly upsetting to established canon within the trilogy.  effectively ruins every original trilogy character to advance these new trilogy characters.  nonsense plot\\, no world building\\, the protagonist rey has literally no motivation other then \\\"to find her place\\\".  she fall for some dark brooding asshole like the sexist cliche she is.  this was such a massive mistake and not even close to a full list of why this movie is terrible.  dont go see it\\, dont see anything star wars again until kathleen kennedy is removed from her position of authority over the star wars canon.\\n\\nI REPEAT dont go see it\\, dont see anything star wars again until kathleen kennedy is removed from her position of authority over the star wars canon.","true":true}
