Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what all this hate is about\\, sure there are some convenient problems to create conflict and move the story forward\\, and some \\\"WTF that is so random\\\" moments. But\\, overall the entire movie is entertaining\\, enjoyable\\, and breathtaking\\, not to mention the epic fight sequences both with lightsabers and starships.","true":true}
