Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a good film. It\u2019s well structured with great action scenes and wonderful CGI. The slapstick comedy was a nice touch but only warranted a smirk or a small chuckle - nothing hilarious. However\\, I couldn\u2019t help feel but let down by the direction Disney wants to take the Star Wars franchise after this film. Snoke seemed to be a great villain that could have had arc throughout the franchise\\, but I\u2019m guessing he was unimportant; and apparently Mark Hamill is pulling a Harrison Ford in this film. What\u2019s key to point out is his character was underplayed and the way they sent him off was honorable and emotional but not as heartfelt - they certainly could have done better given his precedence. Overall\\, it\u2019s worth it for the action but be weary of the flattened answers to the questions you had from the Force Awakens. Plus\\, the dullness and cheesiness of certain parts of the movie might just want you to walk out cringing. ","true":true}
