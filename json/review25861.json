Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not getting the same connection with these new characters as I did with the original New Hope era ones.  Ray is a strong one\\, but the others just seem too shallow and without substance\\, ie. Rose to name one\\, Kylo Ren as another.  I hope Disney does not destroy this great franchise by trying to turn it into another one of their colossal merchandising cash cows.   And come on\\, please stop with the embedded political messaging from planet  Earth ..... It's the WRONG galaxy for that !   You are losing the core audience that followed it for the great story it offered\\, not all this overlaid garbage.","true":true}
