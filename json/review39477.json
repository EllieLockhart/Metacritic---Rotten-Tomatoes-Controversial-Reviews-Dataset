Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film ruined my childhood heroes. I have never hated a film before. I just didn't care enough. But about SW I did care\\, I never will again. I feel like betrayed by the best friend now.","true":true}
