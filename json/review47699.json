Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I found out The Force Awakens was going to be directed by J.J. Abrams\\, I was absolutely excited about it\\, as he has directed amazing movies and TV shows. Episode VII was as amazing as I expected or perhaps even more. I then found out Abrams wouldn't be directing Episode VIII\\, but I went to see it with an open mind. Unfortunately\\, I felt that the story line J.J. began was drastically changed on Episode VIII\\, in what seem to be an obvious attempt to destroy everything Abrams created. Episode VIII appeared to be a whole bunch of nothing with only one scene worth seeing (Rey and Kylo's scene together). The main characters were turned into some hokey-comedians (where that sort of humor used to be reserved for the droids). The good ol' traditional line\\, \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\" was completely tossed out for the first time. To me\\, Rian Johnson was some bitter director determined to annihilate the legacy of Star Wars.","true":true}
