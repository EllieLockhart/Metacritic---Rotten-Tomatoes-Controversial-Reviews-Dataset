{"101487":110856,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brace yourself. I wrote this at 3 in the morning. That is how royally angry I am about this abomination and utter disgrace I watched tonight. I am so mad. The more I think about it the madder I get. I am royally pissed off. The bad far outweighed the good. The Force Awakens was amazing but Rian Johnson has taken a dump on Star Wars of the most epic diarrhea proportions. First\\, the humor. Oh my word. The stupid little porgs? Once was fine. To have them awkwardly and annoyingly placed throughout the whole movie was straight garbage. Humorous attempts at crappy dialogue which were over the top\\, and harmed the movie by undercutting tension. I get Star Wars has funny moments. Get some moments that are naturally funny\\, stop trying to get forced\\, cheap laughs! Leia peter panning it in space...nuff said. Snoke was wasted. Here\u2019s this bad guy that they\u2019ve hyped up for two years. This incredibly powerful and mysterious villain. Who is he? Where did he come from? The answers you will not get\\, he loses his periferal vision and is decaptidated by an unmanned light saber. This guy randomly shows up. Where was he when Sideous and Vader were terrorizing the galaxy? You won\u2019t ever learn\\, because\\, you know\\, answers don\u2019t matter. Finn and the Rose. She sucked. Their entire purpose was pointless. Wasted on a weird ass trip to some casino island where we learn that rich people are bad and we shouldn\u2019t be cruel to animals. That whole sequence was royally unnecessary. Fact\\, nothing these two do serves any purpose whatsoever. Benicio Del Toro. A great actor who\u2019s character serves absolutely no purpose and should have been cut or re-written day one. Now let\u2019s talk about Rey\\, one of the good things about this movie. But wait\\, two years of fan theories and mystery about her origins\\, yet gone is the cool Star Wars lore of what was once cannon before uncle Disney took over. Her parents are worthless nobodies??? Screw that!!! What a cop out. Absolutely lame. What a waste of what could have been a cool piece of Star Wars lore or a shocking reveal. Nope. A cheap cop out conversation with Kylo Ren. \u201cWell that sounds good to me\\,\u201d says whoever let that decision be so poorly handled. Yoda. Cool. They brought back the old Yoda. Great! Wow! Then you realize it\u2019s a cheap two minutes of pointless dialog inserted simply to motivate Luke\\, who\u2019s character was ruined\\, just absolutely ruined. They could have brought back Yoda or Obi Wan and made them awesome and used them effectively. Wasted. And now let\u2019s talk about Luke. A shameful disgrace to one of the most iconic film\\, science fiction\\, and Star Wars characters in history. Here\u2019s his storyline.....sit around on an island on my ass and then go die. The the last scene of The Force Awakens....there\u2019s Rey\\, holding out Luke\u2019s lightsaber to a badass looking Luke Skywalker\\, with an awesome metal hand and beard\\, shrouded in mystery....cut to The Last Jedi\\, old senile Luke throws this iconic lightsaber of Star Wars lore over his shoulder in a cheap\\, childish effort to make audiences laugh. Two scenes that royally pissed me off to epic proportions! Scene 1: Finn is going down the barrel at that cannon. He knows what he has to do\\, and he is willing to sacrifice his life for his friends and his cause. The music is dramatic. This is emotional. Boom! What happens? His wannabe girlfriend (who seems like the beginning of a love triangle between him and Rey\\, no Pleeeease no) crashes into him and says the sappiest\\, crappiest\\, dumbest\\, cheesiest\\, line of the whole film. \u201cWe don\u2019t win by killing the ones we hate\\, we win by saving the one\u2019s we love.\u201d What. On. Earth???? Had Finn died\\, who\u2019s character (let\u2019s face it)\\, isn\u2019t serving much purpose at this time\\, it would have been dramatic\\, beautiful\\, and impactful. What a load of crap! Scene 2: Here comes Luke. Badass. Ready to face what has been haunting him all these years. To save his friends and fight for his cause. This aged warrior goes to face his mortal enemy whom he is yet\\, so torn over. Here is the moment that EVERYONE was waiting for. By everyone I mean EVERYONE!! Master vs apprentice. Anakin vs. Obi wan. Vader vs. Obi Wan. Luke vs. Vader. Good vs. evil. The glorious final showdown where Luke gets the incredible 21st century lightsaber dual he deserves. Nope! It\u2019s a bonafide hologram. And I knew it! I called it in my mind. As he was walking out I was internally begging \u201ccan we please just have an amazing lightsaber dual of epic proportions\\, in a battle of good vs evil\\, light vs darkness\\, blood\\, sweat\\, and tears as this aged warrior combats his younger and arguably stronger opponent.\u201d But I knew better. I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO SCREW IT UP. The music\\, the tension\\, and THEN....cut to Po and Finn talking about how \u201che\u2019s buying us time.\u201d In that moment\\, I knew the tension was gone\\, and that this fight\\, this legendary dual\\, was not going to happen. Then he goes and dies from what?Exhaustion??!!!! Mystery\\, lore\\, endless possibilities\\, character arcs\\, WASTED by this film I just watched tonight. DISGRACEFUL! Also\\, this movie was flat out boring in some parts. What was Star Wars always? A grand fantasy space opera about good verses evil\\, with courageous men and women fighting for what was right against powerful and ruthless bad guys. But in this movie\\, we get to sit through an hour of Rey and Kylo looking at their internal struggles and chit chatting via force connect. Where are the vicious lightsaber duals? Where\u2019s the mystery and lore? Where\u2019s the courageous triumph of good over evil? Even The Phantom Menace had the legendary lightsaber dual at the end. And the humor\\, oh the worthless humor. Finn\u2019s showdown against Phasma was cool\\, until he undramatically rises up on a makeshift elevator and proceeds to goofily and laughably say \u201chey\u201d once again undercutting good tension\\, before slicing her helmet. Way to mess up drama. What a waste. An absolute disgrace to a legendary character in Luke Skywalker\\, and a great injustice to all Star Wars fans. While there were good things about this film\\, in the end\\, it is shameful and disgraceful.","true":true}
