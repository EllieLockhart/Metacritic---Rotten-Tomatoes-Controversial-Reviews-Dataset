Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the trolls -- this is an excellent movie. I've been a gigantic Star Wars fans since I saw the first movie at the drive-in when I was three years old. It's exciting\\, unpredictable\\, fun\\, touching. There are some great action scenes. Adam Driver delivers a powerful performance as Kylo Ren. Everyone who is worried about questions that are still hanging out there -- there is another movie coming. It's going to be okay. I'm excited to see this again and again and to take my kids to see it.","true":true}
