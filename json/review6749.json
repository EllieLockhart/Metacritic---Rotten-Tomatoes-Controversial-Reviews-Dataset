Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u0092t listen to the butthurt Star Wars who are sad because they didn\u0092t see their theories come true. The unexpected is exciting\\, along with the movie.","true":true}
