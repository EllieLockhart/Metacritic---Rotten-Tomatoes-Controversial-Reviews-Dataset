Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AWESOME movie. It is NOT a copy of any prior film as I have heard falsely told. Also the whining I hear from \\\"fans\\\" is without any merit. I have seen and loved all the films and this one fits right in. Wonderful show!","true":true}
