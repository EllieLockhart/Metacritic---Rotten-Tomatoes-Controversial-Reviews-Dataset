{"101487":96932,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2015's The Force Awakens left us with brand new characters\\, unlimited potential and a vision of hope for Disney's ambitions with the Star Wars saga. After the disappointing and pointless story that was Rogue One\\, I went into The Last Jedi hoping to see the magic back in the second instalment of Disney's sequel trilogy. Before I went into the midnight premier\\, critics online had already given the film praise\\, and I felt thrilled to see Star Wars back at its best. And when the scroll went over the screen I believed that. The film started out well\\, Poe and BB-8 captured the beginning of the film bringing the action straight into the film. But within half an hour this hope slowly began to fade. Soon enough the issues and face-palm worthy moments began to pile up. First was the moment the film took a 30+ year old fan-favourite character\\, Admiral Ackbar\\, into the biggest trap he would ever face: being killed off-screen with a mere sentence regarding his death as if he never even matter. But OK\\, I get that not everyone is a Star Wars fanatic and this isn't going to upset everybody. However\\, when his replacement came through the door\\, a purple haired mysterious and misleading \\\"leader\\\" whose name I haven't bothered to learn\\, the hope for this saga's path started fizzling. Don't get me wrong\\, this wasn't the boiling point. Oh no. There was more. Next\\, after the moment we Literally spent 2 years waiting for - the moment where Rey gives Luke his lightsaber - Disney tosses away every ounce of plot The Force Awakens set us up for. He tosses the lightsaber away. Funny\\, right? Lol. Then\\, instead\\, he goes and boob sucks an alien. Oh so funny. WHY?? The face-palms only continued. Leia got blasted through forking space and as if she was from some unoriginal fantasy movie\\, floats through space as an ice crystal back to the ship. For literally no reason other than to sit around the rest of the film. Wtf?? Then purple hair lady takes over and creates internal divisions in the resistance. THE RESISTANCE. The people who we're supposed to look up to\\, see in light and bravery\\, literally turn against themselves. What heroes. The purple hair lady literally serves no purpose other than a pointless 15 minute side plot that can be summarised as: 'oh no is she bad?' - 'oh\\, no she isn't\\, she was just lying\\, what a hero'. A-m-a-z-i-n-g. Then we see another draining side plot emerge\\, Finn and Rose's venture to find a 'code breaker'. Now\\, before I dive in\\, can we just acknowledge how The Force Awakens set this film up. Genuinely loveable\\, inspiring and action packed Finn and Poe bromance\\, a hopefully romance between Finn and Rey\\, and endearing character development. So where did The Last Jedi take us? No where. Poe and Finn literally spend 5 minutes in the same scene\\, Rey and Finn's love story is squashed by Rose's character and Finn tries to take the coward's way out of the entire plot which squashed the ex-stormtrooper's journey toward heroism. This is not even my biggest issue. In the 2015 film Abrams used extensive puppetry\\, setting and scenery to make us feel the same way we did with the Original Trilogy in terms of the Star Wars Universe. Jakku's characters\\, creatures\\, subtle gestures at continuity and Star Wars legacy. Even Maz's planet echoes Star Wars. So\\, when Finn and Rose leave to the planet of RichPeople we see what? A Las Vegas style casino. Drunken CGI frogs aliens. Gambling dip wits. And CGI dog tauntauns. I honestly struggled to watch this scene. Take any Star Wars film\\, you will see the puppets\\, the aliens\\, the THINGS THAT MAKE IT STAR WARS. But we got ass kicked to Humanville\\, and the introduction of drunkenness to the previously pure Universe. Why did we need this?? Why did we need to see casinos\\, gambling\\, humans??? That entire scene passes as a Bond film\\, it is Nothing like the Star Wars we were expecting. And beside all that\\, it wasn't even a good scene. Our newest character\\, DJ\\, was the most disappointing character I've ever met. A slobby human. Why did I need this in my Star Wars film? But OK\\, we're only in the first hour of the film. The issues are beginning to topple. Now let's jump to breaking point. Snoke. The saga's mysterious\\, anticipated Bad Guy. The guy behind the First Order. The guy who revived the Empire. The guy who is literally the reason these films even exist. In 1983 Return of the Jedi ended with only peace left in the galaxies. We were all waiting to hear Snoke's story. To make a connection to the original films to give the new saga meaning. Some valid reason for his restoration of evil. For his motives. For his rise to power. What do we get? We get him killed off by the rotation of a bloody lightsaber half way through the film??? Sliced in half?? With not even a fight to go down in?? Yes. The guy who made an entire fleet of evil\\, a new Death Star\\, the entire First Order; killed without even a fight. Just like that. Gone. As if he never mattered. What The Duck. Backstory? Nope! Motives? Nope! Connection to the original films or at least a subtle mention or point toward an importance to his motive? Lol. Just like that\\, gone. SIGHHHH. How pointless. It's as if every good aspect of The Force Awakens was gone. The character development\\, it's direction\\, it's plot; flushed away. Without Han Solo they could have given an independent heroic revival of Chewbacca. With Artoo awake we could have had the joyous Threepio and Artoo side stories that Literally All Other Films Had back. We could have had literally anything else. Luke's character\\, his 30 years of inspiration and idolisation by millions across the world was even shattered. The hero. The saga's Good Guy. They literally ruined him. Every ounce of him. He turned into a parody of his previous character. A mockery of Luke. The Entire Film felt like a mockery of Star Wars. The only good bits I enjoyed in this film were the movie's obvious marketing and audience-seeking-and-otherwise-pointless-cameos that I enjoyed merely out of my fan love. Yoda's return undoubtably made me smile effortlessly\\, but deep down I knew it was only there for that purpose\\, for bringing the cheap nostalgic smile. Otherwise it was pointless. The entire film was pointless\\, when you think about it. The space battle takes reign of the whole 2+ hour movie. Most movies in the franchise span at least two phases of storyline\\, whereas this stayed in the same space scene for the entire time merely ending with the set up for a new battle. The film takes us no where. There's no moments of victory\\, defeat\\, hope\\, dare I say emotion. The film left us with only the beginning of the action and started at endless potential. The potential for heroism\\, for a showdown\\, for a lightsaber duel of light and dark\\, for a Star Wars film. We got a runaway ship\\, pointless side plots that literally became the film's focus\\, and ended with Kylo Ren only now ready for action. ENDED. Sighing. What a pointless continuation. The film killed all the hope The Force Awakens gave us. Every good thing about it. Every plot it so effortlessly paved the way toward. Crushed. Oh well. At least we've got Harry Potter and his magic broom to look forward to for the next 2 years. And yes\\, you heard me right. The film ended with one last joke to the audience\\, with a wizard kid force lifting a broomstick chim-chimeney style. How Star Wars is that. Thoroughly disappointed at a film that could have been so much more. What the critics see in this I have no idea. To someone unfamiliar with Star Wars the visual effects\\, the cinematography and the vast length of the film probably inspire positive and loving reviews. But this isn't Marvel. This is Star Wars. The movie may be good as a stand-alone and meaningless film\\, but the millions of cinema-goers didn't go to see The Last Jedi to see a film. They came to see Star Wars. And by God we did not get that. Despite the hate the prequels get\\, at least George Lucas gave us that. If there's any chance left for Episode IX in 2019\\, I'll hang on to it. But I can't say I see much of it. So help us\\, J.J Abrams\\, you're our only hope. See you in 2 years. No pressure.","true":true}
