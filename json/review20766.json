Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this\\, but the plot holes won't let me.\\n\\nLuke studies the force for months with Ben Kenobi and still had to struggle to summon his light saber while upside down in the cave in Hoth. Rey takes a 1-hour Intro to the Force class from Luke and can suddenly move mountains?\\n\\nLeia flying through space looked like Belinda the good witch from The Wizard of Oz. \\n\\nWho is Snoke\\, and how did he come to lead the First Order? Who cares\\, he's dead! Stabbed in the back (side) by the guy who's mind he was supposedly reading.\\n\\nLet's spend an entire movie trying to find a map that will lead us to a Jedi master across the Galaxy\\, because maybe he'll help buy us 5 minutes while we escapee from some future close call. Seriously\\, this is all Luke ends up being? A speed bump in a pursuit? Jedi Hodor?\\n\\nLaura Dern\\, think you could have warp speeded them before they wiped out half your transport ships?\\n\\nHey Finn\\, go to the casino planet and find a guy with a red flower pin who can break into Snoke's ship. Look at him for 5 seconds\\, then get some different guy to do it. Risk your life behind enemy lines\\, get double crossed\\, and... oh never mind\\, we changed our minds and bailed to the nearest planet. Sorry about all that!\\n\\nTack on a love story between two characters who just met\\, add in some cuddly\\, big-eyed furry things that we can sell\\, and movie done.","true":true}
