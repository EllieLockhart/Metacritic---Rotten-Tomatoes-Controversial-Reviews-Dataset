Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I begin?  The writing is so fundamentally flawed\\, so self-defeating\\, so poorly structured...  The complications are overly contrived\\, the fictitious battle tactics are stupid to the point of laughable...  And it takes nearly an hour and a half to get going\\, resulting in an unnecessarily long movie that feels about three times longer than its 2 1\/2 hour runtime.  A galaxy of build-up and potential totally squandered out of laziness and disrespect for the audience\\, leaving Episode IX with the seemingly impossible challenge of not only wrapping \\\"the Skywalker Saga\\\" in any kind of meaningful way but of making us even care anymore.","true":true}
