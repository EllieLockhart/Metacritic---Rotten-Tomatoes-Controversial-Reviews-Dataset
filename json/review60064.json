Graphics are gorgeous\\, not surprisingly from Naughty Dog\\, and game play is smooth and in keeping with how we played through Part 1. Nothing drastically new to learn to play P2. From the start\\, the story is gripping and has a far more complex\\, engaging structure than its predecessor. The game flashes backwards frequently to provide the context for decisions Ellie (and others) just made. The result is a very well-developed universe where genuine character development is possible. I won't spoil anything\\, of course\\, but TLOU2 is a treat from the first to the last minute. Some reviews on here and elsewhere are hard on the game for its social justice\\, LGBTQ themes (again no spoilers from me). Such bad press is unwarranted and unfortunate considering the genuine quality on display by the team at Naughty Dog. I'm pretty sure that some gay\/transgender people would survive the apocalypse\\, and the population left around to deal with the infected would harbour some of the prejudices and presuppositions our society faces today. The game does a good job of demonstrating how existing issues survive the outbreak. Anyways...story is top-notch\\, and the performance by Ashley Johnson as Ellie is even better than before. TLOU2 will go down as one hell of a final hurrah for the PS4. I do hope there's a Part 3 on PS5\\, if\\, however\\, they can find a story as compelling as Part 2. If not\\, then Part 2 will be the finale of a terrific\\, very memorable series.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
