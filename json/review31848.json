{"101487":169217,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Alert- dont read if u havent seen Last Jedi yet. Grrrhh. Im lying here trying to sleep and so many plotholes and wasted characters keep running through my mind about Last Jedi. Like: I'd say that Captain Phasma is the most underdeveloped and underused character ever except\\, oh wait a minute\\, there's Snoke- the SUPREME FUCKING LEADER that was never developed\\, I know nothing about\\, and gets killed pretty much the first time we meet him. Now you might say: \\\"but dude\\, the same with the Emperor in the original series.\\\"  But you see\\, here's the difference- they teased us along for sooooooooooooooooooo\\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\\n(See how i did that) long with the Emperor that we were practically begging to see him. And the acting was so great that when you did meet him you could just feel that he was the embodiment of pure evil. It was like finally meeting the devil himself. You didnt need to be told his background\\, you had already made it up in your head\\, and it was this: he is the embodiment of evil\\, of the dark side\\, that must be destroyed at all costs\\, and then when we finally met him it was like. \\\"Yup thats him\\, gotta kill that dude.\\\"  This Snoke character I was like\\, oh look at that\\, I thought from the last movie he was gonna be like 50 feet tall but he's just some ugly guy I really dont give a shit about.  I mean\\, did anyone else keep  looking at him trying to guess who he was before the big reveal of who he was. I mean that's what they built us up for with all the not telling us who he was and all the pre movie speculation and then... they didnt deliver. Oh hes just some character for Ren to kill during his infatuation\/ love fest with Rey.  Jesus fucking christ\\, you had me\\, you had me waiting for the big reveal and then... tic tic nothing. What the fuck. I mean it was like the ultimate fucking cock tease.  Now let me get back to Captain Phasma. Ok\\, you create like the most totally badass stormtrooper ever\\, give this stormtrooper the coolest fucking armor in the galaxy (sorry Bobafett\\, I love you baby but her armor is cooler) make her a badass like 7 foot tall Scandinavian chick (awesome!) and then never have her do anything more badass than walk around in her armor and never give us any insight into who she is\\, how she got to be THE baddest ass stormtrooper in the galaxy\\, and then have her die in some lame ass fight where she dies by getting sucker punched in the face and falling into space\/an explosion. It was kinda like Bobafett's\\nDeath- LAME!  And let's talk about the elephant in the room- the fucking plothole big enough to fly a star destroyer through (Not the local bulk cruisers mind you\\, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now)- the last movie saw the Republic (the fucking Republic\\, not some resistance) destroy the New Order's fucking massive planet sized death star (was someone feeling inadequate the day came up with the idea for Starkiller base anyway?) and a lot of its fleet\\, garrison and grounds troops etc.   Now at the start of Last Jedi the Republic (let me say this again\\, when we left off they were THE FUCKING REPUBLIC\\, not some tiny ass band of rebels) has become a band of like a few thousand resistance fighters?  I mean what the fuck happened?  Granted the Republic lost some planets last time and according to wiki its capital star system and part of its fleet\\, but compared to the amount of capital and resource expenditure Starkiller base must have represented for the part of the galaxy the First Order controlled and Id say it was pretty much a wash last time. Yet somehow since that movie ended and this one (which cannot have been long because the characters didnt really age) Im supposed to believe that the First Order so completely turned it around and kicked the Republic's ass that the Republic was defeated and left to basically the last straggling fighters in what is now just a resistance?  Sorry\\, but as C3PO would say\\, the chances of this are 3\\,456\\,568\\,920\\,0475\\,245\\,9573\\,028 to 1. I mean if it really went that bad for the Republic (a government who controlled numerous star systems and a large part of the galaxy) that quickly\\, then they fucking suck as a government and military and deserve to be wiped out. I mean I sure as fuck dont want to be ruled by those fucking inept boobs.  Now lets get to Rey- ooh who are her parents\\, how is she so innately powerful in the force (we hear Luke tell us that the only other person to have power like this is Kylo Ren-ok well that makes sense hes the grandson of Darth fucking Vader and Han's son) so she must be the daughter of like some really\\npowerful fucking jedi or force sensitive creature. But nope- she's apparently just the daughter of some drunk gamblers or some horseshit who sold her for booze money or something.  Hmmm\\, now let me think\\, maybe who Snook is wasnt the ultimate cock tease\\, maybe who Rey's parents are was- oh well doesnt matter\\, theyre one and two you pick the order. And lets talk about this black hole- no i mean literally that black hole with like sea weed growing out of it that's on Luke's island- you know the mysterious one that is the entrance to the dark side's power there. Now with EVERY other Star Wars before becoming a jedi the person enters an area strong in the dark side\\, usually physically represented by some dark and scary place with spookies or creepy crawlies around\\, and the person has to face his\/her worst fears. So finally after some build up Rey falls\/gets sucked down the seaweed hole into - a cave with some water and a mirror and ... NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENS. I guess Rey's worst fear is boredom because that's about all she faces here. Unless you consider like a carnival style funny mirror to be really fucking scary (perhaps if they had added a carnival clown it would have been scary- I mean I fucking hate clowns and am pretty sure they are evil). When she started snapping her fingers i started to laugh because i thought she was going to start like snapping her fingers and tap dancing or something- Kind of like starlord- at least that would have been funny and have relieved the boredom of the scene. And then there is the basic plot of the movie- slow ships being chased by slightly slower ships while people try to figure out how to blow up the slightly slower ships before the slow ships run out of gas (you'd think they'd have like some exxon stations or something around you know). So i guess the movie can be summed up by one word- kinda boring (ok ok \\, technically its two words- well three is you use proper english but fuck that- but \\\"boring\\\" seemed a little too harsh). I mean it was entertaining enough\\, but it seemed like the basic plot revolved around mundane characters  being rather mundane. Oh my last major gripe-\\nCan we please get rid of the overt throw backs to movie sequences of yesteryear that are out of place in a galaxy where they have invented lightspeed. Im referring here to the WWII era bombing run by the resistance bombers on the Dreadbaught (awesome name by the way- thats classic Star Wars- invoke a name with recognition conjuring up images of the awesome battleships of Great Britain and put it on like the most awesome type of Star Destroyer). I mean seriously\\, you can fucking invent lightspeed travel\\, tracking through lightspeed travel etc but cant invent a guided fucking missile?  You still have to go on a bombing run\\, line up the bombers with their targets (I even saw a WWII era bombing sight) and MANUALLY OPEN THE FUCKING BOMB-BAY DOORS AND DROP THE BOMBS? (Btw- why wouldnt they get sucked out into space the minute the bomb-bay doors open) Seriously? Wtf? Now there's plenty to nickpick about star wars films as always\\, but I can let a lot of the smaller stuff go (like how did Finn and Rose know where to fly the shuttle when they escaped given that the recently promoted Admiral woman hadnt told either of them her plan nor would they have known it since they got their info from Poe who didnt know it) when the movie is flowing and its fun. But these bigger issues are real problems for me and took away from the otherwise enjoyability of it. The good stuff- Luke\\, Kilo Ren\\, Hux\\,Leia\\, Rey\\, Rose\\, Finn- all either well enough developed characters or the acting conveys their personality enough that you care about them and enjoy watching them and wondering what will happen to them. I left poe off that list bc i feel like he almost falls into the Snook\/Captain Phasma category of you gave us a cool character but he's so underdeveloped as a character and seems so cliche that hes hard to believe- luckily Oscar Isaac plays him so well he sort of overcomes the limitations of his character and the script- if they would just do more with what he offers. The filming is gorgeous\\, the battle scenes believable enough and fun\\, and the pacing pretty good (except as I said during some of the real boring stuff) and there are some scenes that are really good - kylo ren killing snoke and then he and rey uniting to fighting the red armored royal guards was great. I just feel like it was some good scenes and cool cinematography united by an overall weak plot with a lot of characters who could be really cool just kinda cast on the scrap heap. Which keeps me from loving it. I dont understand why with all of the writers and everybody else working on these films we basically got a re-hash plot-wise of A New Hope in Force Awakens and basically a boring wet noodle of a plot in this one. I mean they seriously couldnt come up with anything better?  I say let whoever wrote the story for Rogue One and the cartoon with Ezra Bridger write the story for the next one in this trilogy- their characters\\, plots and stories are much better.","true":true}
