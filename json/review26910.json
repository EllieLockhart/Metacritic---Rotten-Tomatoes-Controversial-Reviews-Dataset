Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies of the series. Director Johnson takes some bold risks in the narrative to serve up a movie that is thrilling\\, emotional and rich in complex themes and characters. There are sequences that will make audiences stand up and cheer. This is also one of the most beautifully shot installments in the series. Johnson orchestrates exciting action moments\\, while never losing sight of the human stakes at large. This is mainstream filmmaking executed masterfully.  One of the best movies of the year!","true":true}
