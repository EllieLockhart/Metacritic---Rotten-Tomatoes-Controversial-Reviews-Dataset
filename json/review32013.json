{"101487":169417,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS ENCLOSED!! DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!\\n\\nIn short\\, the film gets some things right\\, some things I'm confused about and some things really quite wrong. The result is an incredibly conflicting experience that cannot be easily pinned down and defined.\\n\\nAesthetically\\, the film was excellent. The battle scenes in particular were gorgeous. But in places the CGI was jarringly poor. No more so than close ups of Snoke and Leia in space.\\n\\nIn terms of plot\\, the film is - frankly - a mess. Lots of things happen that mean nothing\\, go nowhere or aren't developed. The absolute best example of this is the very last scene\\, where the falcon is blasting through space at lightspeed and things could easily have ended there. But instead we cut away to kids playing with toys\\, telling a story and looking up to the sky. It was so pointless and also highlights another key criticism - story and run-time bloat. Another example is the casino scene; it seemed totally unnecessary\\, save for a quick social justice warrior message about exploitation being bad... Finally\\, the Snoke story was a talking point of TFA\\, suddenly he's there all the time\\, in the flesh and his story\\, motivation and background is COMPLETELY UNEXPLAINED. His death felt cheap and jarring.\\n\\nIn addition to the hectic\\, haphazard and bloated nature of the plot\\, there were some really quite serious mis-steps. Firstly\\, Leia's non-death. Frankly\\, she either should have escaped the bridge before it was blown up or died in the attack. I don't mind buying into the fantasy\\, but you must maintain some sense of order about the universe you create. Her sudden reanimation was INCREDIBLY jarring and it really\\, really threw me off...\\n\\nFurthermore\\, I really didn't like the way Luke's story was handled. You'll forgive the expression\\, but it felt forced; like the writer had decided to kill him (and the rest of the old guard\\, save for Leia) off at the start\\, wrote the screenplay and forgotten to kill him off\\, then REALISED this and gave him the ending we saw. It felt unnecessary and with no real \\\"purpose\\\" that related to the story. Luke was just getting going again (especially highlighted by a shot where Rey spots his X-Wing - a craft we know can be submerged and then operated)\\, before he LITERALLY just disappears.\\n\\nIn general\\, I feel like they are just gradually forcing off the old cast out of some sense of mission\\, rather than because it serves the story. Note that even Admiral Ackbar is gone. The sad thing is; the only really interesting thing going on between any of the new generation is when Ren and Rey meet - and even that is as confusing as it is intriguing.\\n\\nRey is almost forgettable - lost in the chaos and with her character going nowhere. Kylo Ren is interesting - but his switching allegiances narrative is confusing and bizarre. Rey and Ren are much\\, MUCH more interesting when they are together. I will say this though\\, there does appear to be the seeds of an interesting character dynamic between Finn\\, Rey and Rose - with Ren appearing to be Rey's \\\"match\\\" as well\\, it's not clear how that is going to develop\\, but I'm interested to see it develop...\\n\\nThe humour was also hit and miss. There were a few occasions where (aside from being funny) some jokes really added to the film or the characters. For example\\, when Rey is learning the force and Luke is mocking her. There are others that don't belong and are jarring\\, though. One such example is when Po mocks Hux.  It was off-tone. I don't know how\/why it wasn't picked up at least in post-production\/editing.\\n\\nThere is so much to discuss\\, I could go on for ages. But based on that single first viewing\\, I am incredibly conflicted about this film. I am also concerned that things are being forced on\\, rather than evolving naturally. This latest installment - whilst an OK (if not complete) movie taken solo (heh) - is quite a jarring experience for a returning fan of the series like myself...","true":true}
