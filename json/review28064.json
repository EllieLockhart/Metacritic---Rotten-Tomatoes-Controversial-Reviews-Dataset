Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot is all over the place. Most of the story really seems like it has no real direction. Seems like a remake with no background. Good cinematography\\, and fights scenes but not enough to make this movie a Good watch.","true":true}
