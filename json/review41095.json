Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had more potential than any before it \\,and they killed it in the worst way \\,why was luke skywalker ruined  he didnt even get to be redeemed through the movie \\,never use this director again.","true":true}
