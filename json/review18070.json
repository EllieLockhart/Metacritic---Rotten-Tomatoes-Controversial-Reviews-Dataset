Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think we the audience was searching for ansers in this movie that we didnt get. Instead we got a good going forward with this univurse and some character development that was good\\, i think\\, for the third movie. Mark Hamil did the best performance of his lifetime and i was in awe of the depth hi did. Ok\\, this wasnt the Luke we wanted. But the luke we deserved.","true":true}
