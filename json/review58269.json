Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage.\\nThe main storyline is has huge plot holes like\\, why the imperial warships didn't jumped ahead of the rebel fleet? And why they didn't told nothing to Poe about the plan resulting in a mutiny that may have lead to their deaths? \\nThe segment about Rose and Finn is inrellevant and clearly a giant and drawn out filler\\, not to mention the scene where rose saves Finn from doing some thing useful (btw even here there's a plot hole because they should have been killed by the walkers that were like two meters away)\\nThe characters are average at best but there's some really ideous stuff in here as well.\\nThe admiral is a muppet even for a Star Wars movie there's no excuse he acted like a child at the beginning where he wined about Poe mocking instead of opening fire on him\\nRose is simply useless \\nThe character of Luke has been literally flipped around \\nThey had to explain a little bit more about snoke and phasma before killing them resulting in a bitter disappointment in my behalf (and I dare saying in the behalf of most of the public because they killed off the main villain without explaining who he was and even if he was a threat at all seeing how he died)\\nAnd for the last point we can all agree that they should have killed off Leila instead off doing that moronic space superman scene.\\n\\nIn the end I say don't buy the blue ray it's the worst Star Wars movie since","true":true}
