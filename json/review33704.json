Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TERRIBLE MOVIE! Heartbreakingly bad. If you want to see your favourite childhood movie characters desecrated and ridiculed\\, then go and watch this steaming turd of a movie. Messy\\, confusing\\, long and boring with so many cringe moments it's hard to pick anything redeemable about it. Looks good though as it's had so much money shoved up its backside. Avoid this movie if you want to keep your good memories of Star Wars.","true":true}
