Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm the same age as Rian J. I left the theater with a strange feeling\\, an empty feeling. I can't believe someone my own age could miss so badly on the character of Luke Skywalker. But the worst part\\, is that this film went against the Star Wars continuum. Why?  I just went back and watched the trailer.  It continues to tease the fans focusing on where TFA brought us. But the actual film does its own thing. Thanks Rian for \\\"making a film that you wanted to see\\\".","true":true}
