The major strength of Yakuza 0 is the story. I felt so engaged in the quest. The voice-acting is amazing and the characters are really believable. There are multiple epic moments during the playthrough. This is the type of game you won't forget.\r\rThere is also a lot of content (I did the main quest + extras) and I spent 92 hours in total. The businesses of the 2 main protagonists are also interesting\\, especially the cabaret club. Some mini-games are also really well designed. I recommend to try those ones in priority: Karaoke\\, disco\\, the sega arcade games\\, telephone club\\, bowling and pool.\r\rI repeat the fact that the story is really engaging and this is something uncommon in most of the other video games I played. I'm afraid I will always have higher expectations now for the stories after I've played Yakuza 0\r\rMy heart would like to give 10\/10 to this game but my mind tell me I can't because of a few cons. Here they are:\r1. Graphics look like PS3 or even PS2 sometimes (don't play this game for the graphics)\r2. Some mini-games are not really polished or relevant (didn't like the pocket car racing or the cat fight)\r\rOtherwise\\, this game is perfect and I highly recommend it. I would recommend playing the main story + the substories + the business part + a few mini-games. I wouldn't try to platinum this game though as I would need more than 200 hours and I don't think it is worth it\r\rThis game has a lot of content\\, the gameplay is fun and the story is better than a lot of real movies !\u2026 Expand","true":true}
