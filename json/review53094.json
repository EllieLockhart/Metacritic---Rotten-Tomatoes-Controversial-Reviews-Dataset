Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible addition to the star wars franchise\\, and i can barely call it a star wars film. If you just watch the movies it is probably fine\\, but those who have read the books and delved into the lore will be disgusted by this movie. To think we lost 20 years of work and effort into expanding the star wars lore and that all gets thrown away for this trash.","true":true}
