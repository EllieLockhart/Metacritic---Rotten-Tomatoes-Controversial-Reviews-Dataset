Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of my favorite Star Wars movies of all time. Those who see the Star Wars series as an iconic piece of cinematic history\\, not to be touched\\, will likely not enjoy (as we can see by the audience score.) Those who see Star Wars as an amazing universe with great characters and the room for movies that do something new will probably love.","true":true}
