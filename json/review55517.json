Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"my thoughts relfect what most poeple critisize about this movie. The movie takes the questions everyone had from TFA and does not answer any of them. if they end up answering them in the next movies\\, we won't be surprised and if they don't then we'll still be angry about TLJ. The plots regarding the Resistance escapoing and Finn\/Rose are boring and full of errors. ALmsot everyone invovled with them were forgettable. The biggest problem is that Luke Skywalker\\, who was able to turn Darth Vader to the light\\, didn't even bother to try to save his nephew and debated murdering him (Now we understand why Mark Hamill himself disagreed they did to Luke). Rian Johnsion made a terrible movie and people like him\\, the actors\\, and Kathleen Kennedy (who I consider to be \\\"The Emperor\\\" behind the scenes ruining everything about Star Wars) blame the tried a true Star Wars for it's problems. They tell us we are the dumb ones for not accepting anything with the name \\\"Star Wars\\\" attached to it. To those who say they like this movie I say that people loved the prequels at first too.","true":true}
