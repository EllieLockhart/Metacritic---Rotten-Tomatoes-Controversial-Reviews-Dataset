Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie defeated the entire legacy of Star Wars. They turned Luke into a crazed child killer who doesn't  find his senses until the very end. Also\\, Leia displays some questionable powers that I didn't even know existed based off of the previous 7 movies and the plot achieved nothing and didn't advance the story. Overall\\, pathetic movie and might be worse than the Phantom Menace.","true":true}
