Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best movie ever made! (even better than \\\"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\\\"). The Narrative pacing is perfect and definitely does not feel inconsistent and messy! My favourite part is when Luke extracts green milk from the alien and then drinks it\\, its so funny and one of the best scenes of the movie! I see no flaw with this film. Watch out \\\"The Godfather\\\"\\, because there is a new best movie in town!!!","true":true}
