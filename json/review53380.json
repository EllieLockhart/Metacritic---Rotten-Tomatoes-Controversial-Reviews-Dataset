{"101487":115688,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did you take Star Wars seriously? Well Disney doesnt and makes sure you feel like an asshole if you did. They fucking joke for half the movie and would rather tease itself with stupid quips all the time\\, I hated it. They act like the ending is somehow epic for Rei like it somehow concluded the themes\\, but there was no moment where Rei really progressed\\, all she did was say \\\"no im not gonna be evil and join the first order\\\" thats not epic there was no character progression. Fuck this movie. Also is there any reason why Admiral Holdo couldnt tell the cool pilot guy her plan? Even when she had a gun to her head? It seemed like everyone else was in on it\\, atleast on the command bay. She even shot him(on stun) rather than explain. The only reason was so it could seem like a twist\\, which\\, i mean it was cool\\, but it was just bad writing. I dont think Luke would ever try to kill someone in their sleep\\, i know he never finished his jedi training formally\\, but he was able to become a jedi and keep out the dark at the end of return of the jedi\\, It is totally not within lukes character to do that. FUCK. Next off it is SOOOO fucking in your face with a political message\\, so if you wanted to escape for a moment and just enjoy something cool\\, like fucking star wars\\, then fuck you\\, you have to watch the new lesbian admiral\\, and all the minority characters take out the white men and greedy capitalists. You cannot view this movie without thinking\\, \\\"wow this is preachy and not subtle at all\\\" even if you agree with the message whole heartedly it should annoy you how unpoetically it is presented.  Fuck this movie.  Also when leia survives going into space that was retarded i dont care\\, fuck this movie\\, fuck Disney for making it\\, fuck myself for paying for it\\, fuck everyone who worked on this\\, and fuck you for reading my review. Pirate it if you have to see it","true":true}
