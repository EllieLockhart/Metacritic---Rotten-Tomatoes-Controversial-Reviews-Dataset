Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very surprising turn for the franchise\\, and a very divisive one\\, nonetheless\\, Star Wars: the Last Jedi does its best to break free of the shadow of the original trilogy and become its own thing\\, and it does so successfully. While many may mourn the way the original characters are sidelined in favor of this new generation\\, there is no denying that Star Wars is treading new waters here\\, and supplying fans with many new twists and turns\\, along with more layered storytelling and fleshed out characters.","true":true}
