{"101487":179821,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst part of all was the hatchet job done on Luke Skywalker's character. Luke in the EU was the Grandest Jedi Master that ever lived. The universe's first GRAND Master Jedi. The things he could was incredible. He established a new Jedi order. Trained hundreds of new Jedi. Trained trainers to train Jedi to continue his legacy. Got rid of the no marriage thing. Married Mara Jade\\, had a son who was a hero(Ben) and got rid of the stealing kids at birth to train them as a Jedi & recruited Force sensitive adults. Won the war against the Yuuzahn Vong with his plan for them & was successful in everything he did. Currently he wasn't married\\, no family\\, no kids. Didn't train 1 single student successfully as a Jedi. Sucked as a leader\\, trainer & at life generally. When things got hard he went off to find a Force sensitive planet\\, found it & thought he'd stay there for a nice life & let the Jedi die rather than come back & help clean up his mess. He could have exiled himself on a backwater planet like Jakku or similar \\, why did he go looking for the Journal of the whills\\, find them & then do nothing ? He totally sucked as a Jedi Master & at life in general. How's that for differing story lines ?\\nFurther to that he was going to murder his nephew while he slept !! in cold blood \\, no less ! \\nWhy? He *sensed* darkness in him. Let's not redeem him like he did his Father\\, lets kill him while he's unaware in his sleep ??!! That wasn't an assassination of Ben\\, that was an assassination of Luke Skywalker's character. That's an author who doesn't understand his source material. Luke would never\\, ever kill someone\\, especially his own nephew in cold blood. Combat potentially but never while he slept.\\nSo what did Luke achieve in those 30+ years? Nothing. When the going got tough instead of hanging around to help clean up the mess he created\\, he bailed on the universe. \\nI could take that Han was a dead beat Dad that when the going got tough bailed on his family and went back to illegal activities  as hard as that was but now they've done the same to Luke.\\nHan's dead\\, Luke's dead & the only original trilogy character alive is the one who is *actually* dead in real life ! Carrie ! \\nI get  they want to start a new generation of SW\\, I get this isn't about the old characters\\, this is SW for the new characters\\, for the new audiences but that doesn't mean you have to shit on the old ones in order to do that. Nothing more prophetic than Kylo's reference to \\\"letting the past die and if it doesn't then kill it\\\" Clearly that's what's happening here.  \\nI'm not a new trilogy hater. I like TFA\\, a lot despite the minor flaws it was actually quite good. This one \\, no.\\nThis does *actually* change how I feel about the OT. Now I'll be watching it knowing that after RoTJ Luke went on to achieve literally nothing & suck completely at everything he did. It's not like Indiana Jones & the Crystal Skull when people said \\\"you ruined my childhood\\\" If you didn't like that movie\\, fine\\, but that didn't change your enjoyment of Raiders & Temple of Doom etc\\,  this literally does affect the way the character of Luke plays out. \\nClearly Mark Hamill wasn't too happy either: From IMDB: Mark Hamill told Rian Johnson after reading the script for the film\\, \\\"I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character [Luke Skywalker]. Now\\, having said that\\, I have gotten it off my chest\\, and my job now is to take what you've created and do my best to realize your vision.\\\"\\nI've not liked some SW in the past\\, but it's never left me feeling angry like this.","true":true}
