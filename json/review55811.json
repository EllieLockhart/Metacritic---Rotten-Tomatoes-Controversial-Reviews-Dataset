Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, poorly cast\\, poorly developed characters\\, cringe-worthy humour and naff action sequences. Laughably far removed from what the Star Wars universe is meant to be\\, Disney's legacy will be to destroy everything that made Star Wars unique and dilute it with bland characters\\, unsophisticated dialogue\\, juvenile humour\\, and far too much moralistic Social Justice messaging (\\\"Respect women\\\" comes across extremely strongly\\, and even - inexplicably - \\\"Don't eat meat\\\").\\nRey\\, the lead character\\, is an insufferable Mary Sue to whom everything is always handed and the lore of the universe bends to accommodate her. Her wooden acting is not helped by the completely immemorable and uninspiring script she has to deliver.\\nLuke\\, the hero from the old movies\\, has been turned upside down and inside out to the point where the actor disowned the new interpretation of the character and the old fanbase almost unanimously rejected the movie outright.\\nFinn is one of the best things about the new Star Wars movies and his scenes make this car crash of a film watchable.\\nLeia is bearable until her miraculous and completely unrealistic (even by Star Wars' standards) Superman-esque space flight.\\nAn irritating new character called Rose is introduced presumably to add another check in the diversity tick boxes as she serves little other purpose other than to ruin one of Finn's most heroic moments and simultaneously doom the entire resistance over some airy-fairy notion of 'love trumps hate'\\, puh-lease.\\nJust do not waste your time.","true":true}
