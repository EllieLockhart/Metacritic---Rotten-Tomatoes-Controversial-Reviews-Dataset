Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive\\, as expected. But that is all I have good to say.  The plot is nonsensical.  The script is weak.  The humor rarely hits home and is badly timed in relation to dramatic moments.  I Was less than convinced Luke Skywalker would ever consider murdering his sleeping nephew.  As a fan of Star Wars\\, this movie is just disappointing.","true":true}
