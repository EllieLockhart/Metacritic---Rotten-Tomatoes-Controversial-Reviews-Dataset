Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry to say\\, but this movie was a stinker. Too many plots and dumb things happening.  I'm an SW fan but this is worse than the prequels. Please no more critters or robots just to sell stuff in stores. The flying Leia\\, the destroyed\/not destroyed bridge\\, Poe leading a charge and losing his fleet but only losing rank\\, horrible space battles where the evil empire can't trace the rebels that are right outside their windows\\, etc. Nope\\, it was really bad!","true":true}
