{"101487":190931,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately there is a lot to dislike about the new Star Wars movie and it is FAR weaker then the Force Awakens. Here are a few things:\\n\\n1. This movie is almost entirely irrelevant to the overall story\\, not much is different at the end of this movie compared to the state of the Force Awakens\\, with minor exceptions.\\n\\n2. The story felt disjointed\\, it focused on side missions more than it did on the characters that people actually go to a main Star Wars movie to see.. Namely the Jedi and the Sith.\\n\\n3. Luke... oh boy was this the biggest disappointment of the entire movie. So the ever optimistic hero Luke Skywalker was turned into a pessimistic MGOTW member. \\n\\n4. Aside from ruining Luke's character they also grossly under-used his force prowess and even though all of episode 7 was about finding Luke\\, and episode 8 for the bad guys was stopping the rebels before they could utilize Luke\\, when Luke finally agreed to show up.. he did one minor Force Illusion technique and then died from it.. very very underused and disappointing. I was fully expecting Luke to do some major force work and crush the entire attacking army on that salt planet\\, showing just how legendary he is\\, and how the search for him during the last movie paid off.\\n\\n5. Rae seems able to use the force as well as any Jedi we have seen in any Star Wars movie\\, without any training or Jedi philosophy at all. She seems completely capable of Lightsaber dueling with trained Kylo Ren\\, even though she just picked it up. The entire thing is completely unbelievable and belittles the \\\"student and master\\\" relationship that the previous movies have established.\\n\\n6. Rae again\\, lacks any real growth as a character. Her only struggle seems to be whining about her parents and not knowing her place. Because of these things she come across as a plain vanilla character. Meanwhile Kylo Ren is actually an interesting character who is conflicted about whether he wants to kill his mother or not as he struggles with the light and t he dark. \\n\\nDisney has made a mess of this movie\\, and as it is the last movie we will ever experience a living Luke Skywalker (not counting some prequel solo film that no one needs or wants)\\, it was a massive disappointment and a terrible send off for such a beloved character. \\n\\nMark Hamil actually warned the Director of this movie\\, ahead of release\\, that he didn't agree or like anything that was done with his character Luke. If I were Disney I would be protecting the integrity of this franchise by not allowing any major decisions like that to be handled by any one person. It needed to be handled by a council to ensure that one mans vision didn't take the characters in the wrong direction.. which Rian Johnson's vision clearly did.","true":true}
