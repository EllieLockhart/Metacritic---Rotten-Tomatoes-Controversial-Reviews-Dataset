Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment : \/ (SPOILERS) After TFA and Rogue One\\, The Last Jedi feels like two steps backwards into prequel territory. Excess use of CGI\\, excess use of humor(robbing scenes of their emotional impact)\\, casino \/codebreaker storyline that could literally be removed from the movie and not change anything. The director\u2019s style sticks out like a sore thumb\\, every other shot is a close up failing to allow a scene breath with proper framing. People gripe about JJ Abrams and his lens flare style but he knows how to frame a scene and gets the performance he needs from the actors. Luke\u2019s storyline was interesting but poorly executed. Luke is gone\\, Snoke is gone ( who TF was he? Who cares)\\, Rey is related to... no one (why do we still care now?) Apparently BB8 can do anything\\, and oh yeah Leia can survive a space explosion\\, use the force to revive herself and shield herself and pull herself towards back into a ship. Who knew. I didn\u2019t. ","true":true}
