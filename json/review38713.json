Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing and script of this one make the prequels look like masterpieces.  Rose Tico is this generation's Jar Jar Binks and the humor is more Spaceballs than Star Wars.  Terribly preachy too.  A liberals dream come true.","true":true}
