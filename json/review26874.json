Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best films in the franchise. Raye is an amazing character and has added a real warmth to the films. I\u2019ve seen this with my 14 year old son twice already. Looking forward to the saga continuing!","true":true}
