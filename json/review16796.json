{"101487":138194,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In Praise and Defence of The Last Jedi\\nby\\, Shawn Meunier (SPOILERS)\\n\\nLuke Skywalker told us\\, \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\" And he's right\\, it didn't. And I'm okay with that.\\n\\nTwo years ago\\, The Force Awakens gave audiences a safe way back into Star Wars. It was a blast from the past that introduced us to some new characters\\, but ultimately treaded familiar ground. Similarly last year\\, Rogue One was a look back\\, providing some cool insights\\, but told a story that really had no effect on the Original Trilogy's characters\\, events or themes. I was prepared for The Last Jedi to be something different. I didn't want a story that mimicked The Empire Strikes Back. I didn't want to know plot points before they occurred on screen. I did however\\, want to be surprised and intrigued by a story that inspires and challenges the audience. The Last Jedi does this. In addition\\, it is chock full of great comedic moments\\, incredible space battles\\, gorgeous visuals\\, immersive puppetry and world class visual effects. In my eyes\\, Rian Johnson manages to usher Star Wars away from being overly dependant on nostalgia\\, and into something fresh. Although there are moments that pay homage to the original trilogy\\, The Last Jedi truly beats it's own drum. Raises the stakes\\, assumes a shape of it's own\\, and makes daring choices that push the story into unexpected and creative territory.\\n\\nLike most of the Star Wars films however\\, there is always controversy. In the case of The Last Jedi\\, long-time fans are seriously divided. Many have embraced the film\\, while others not so much. Even amongst my immediate circle\\, many friends whose opinions I respect\\, feel they were let down\\, or in some way duped by The Last Jedi. Some are even claiming that the dreaded prequels are more watch worthy\\, that the script is weak\\, a dog's breakfast\\, that Disney has committed Star Wars suicide. I couldn't disagree more. Though that's not to say that this film is void of flaws. I too noticed The Last Jedi has it's share of illogical moments\\, unaddressed plot holes\\, and corny jokes. I just refuse to hold the film to a higher standard than the other episodes in the series. Sometimes\\, Star Wars is just Star Wars. Fans have had a 40 year love affair with these stories. They have developed compressed feelings for the characters\\, themes\\, framework and possess an incredibly high expectation of what to expect from a Star Wars story. If creative choices attempt to try anything new to challenge the familiar\\, many fans feel betrayed and upset they didn't get THEIR version of Star Wars. The Last Jedi is not the \\\"fan made\\\" version theorized about over the past 2 years. It is not the easy to swallow Star Wars comfort food some fans were anticipating. The Last Jedi is its own thing. This is a NEW Star Wars. Not the old one. The Rebellion is reborn.\\n\\nFor the majority of its two and a half hour run time\\, The Last Jedi clips along at a relatively punchy pace. Even during it's second act\\, on Canto Bight\\, which for some fans feel is the film's low point\\, I found myself in love with what Johnson does within the narrative. If Finn and Rose hadn't gone to the casino\\, they wouldn't have met DJ. If they hadn't met DJ and he hadn't betrayed them\\, the First Order would not have learned that the Resistance were hiding on Crait. This section of the film gives us an exciting Miyazaki inspired sequence\\, plus insight into the class structure within the Star Wars universe. We learn that the galaxy's citizens are made up of shades of grey\\, not only dark and light. It is though this realization\\, that Finn discovers what side he's really on\\, and what he's fighting for.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi also takes the liberty to rewrite the prequel induced rules of the Force. Resetting it back to how it was originally written\\, allowing ALL living things to access it. When Rey's parents are exposed as loser nobodies\\, it confirms that even a random scavenger from nowhere\\, can tap into the Force. THAT to me is the film's big reveal\\, and it is a concept incredibly important to the future of the Star Wars universe. It makes us believe\\, have hope and wonder in the Force again. Any one of us can be Force sensitive. It's not exclusive to the Jedi or the Sith\\, or for those with midi-chlorians in their blood. Even you\\, can use the Force.\\n\\nIn another exciting moment\\, challenging what the audience thinks they know of the Force. General Leia manifests it\\, and saves herself from the vacuum of Space. \\\"How could this happen? She's unconscious. She's never been trained in the Force!\\\" First off\\, it's Star Wars. It's a fantasy movie where all sorts of magical things can occur. Second of all\\, Leia has used the Force multiple times before\\, and she usually does so instinctively\\, when it's beyond her control. And Thirdly\\, she's the Daughter of DARTH VADER\\, the most powerful Force wielder ever. So suspend your disbelief and enjoy the moment\\, it was beautiful.\\n\\nThe film's main contention however\\, is with the treatment of Luke Skywalker. Many fans expected the same guy that audiences were left with at the end of Return of the Jedi. The same Luke (although no longer canon) that we read about in the Zahn novels\\, and played in our video-games. \\\"How could they take our hero\\, the one who defeated Darth Vader\\, and break him?\\\" Well\\, because he broke. It's like people forget how rough Luke's had it over the years. The only parents he ever loved\\, were burned to death by Stormtroopers. Obi Wan deceived and lied to him about his heritage. Eventually\\, he has to confront and essentially kill his true Father. Even after Anakin's redemption\\, and the saving of the galaxy\\, he must surrender to the fact that evil returns. Attempting to move on\\, Luke senses the \\\"Vader\\\" in his own nephew\\, and has a fleeting moment of fear that results in extreme consequences. Kylo Ren destroys everything Luke built. His Jedi temple\\, all of his students and in return\\, his Faith. The accumulation of all of these tragic events make Luke Skywalker the most sympathetic character in the series. He was never intended to be a Messiah. He is human after all. But guess what? This isn't about Luke. It involves him\\, but if you want a Luke Skywalker story\\, you won't find it here. The new trinity of characters is Rey\\, Poe\\, and Finn. The story belongs to them now. In The Last Jedi\\, Mark Hamill gives us his greatest performance as Luke. A character with dimension\\, conflict and a history. I saw the little boy from Tatooine\\, now an old hermit\\, hiding away\\, struggling with guilt. The same way Obi Wan and Yoda both had before him. Lost and damaged\\, Luke must forgive himself for failing Ben Solo\\, his friends\\, and the galaxy. This choice\\, is far more interesting than any other route they may have taken with the character.\\n\\nYou CAN break traditions and conventions. After all\\, rules are meant to be broken. Especially within the Fantasy genre. As a result\\, the story and it's characters become more interesting and dynamic. Nothing here was casual or unintentional. Johnson needed to move away from the cyclical story that Star Wars lends itself to. The whole point of these new movies was to pass the torch. So let's pass it\\, and stop going in circles. The Last Jedi has given Star Wars permission to explore and evolve into something else.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, felt very much like a Star Wars film\\, trying not to not be a Star Wars film. It's about failure\\, letting go of the past\\, and moving forward. As the dust settles\\, this chapter will certainly go down as the most divisive film in the franchise. As a fan\\, I witnessed only a few moments that irked me. Though for many\\, it is a very polarizing experience. Ultimately\\, I came away feeling revitalized and excited for Episode IX. Is it my favourite Star Wars film? No. Is it the Empire Strikes Back that people were expecting? No. Is it good? Absolutely\\, because it breaks the Jedi mold\\, and honours what I love about Star Wars.\\n\\n8\/10","true":true}
