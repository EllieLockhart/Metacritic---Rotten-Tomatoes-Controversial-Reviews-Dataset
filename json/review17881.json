Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has good action sequences and elements but there were wayyy too many characters that get introduced and disapair again without any meaning and too many side plots and distractions. The humour was good but again\\, wayyy too many times this film wants to be funny. Feels sometimes like a childrens movie. overall worth watching but not for a second time.","true":true}
