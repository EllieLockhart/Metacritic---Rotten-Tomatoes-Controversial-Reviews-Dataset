Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far from the nostalgia wankery that plagued The Force Awakens\\, Last Jedi actively uses it legacy to tell a story that marries its old characters with the new ones\\, finally creating some credence for all of them where there was none before. Star Wars had a huge uphill battle getting me to like Kylo Ren after TFA portrayed him as an angsty rarr rarr character\\, but Last Jedi did it. That Scene with Those Three Characters is great.\\n\\nBut compared to that one line in Rogue One about not looking up\\, this is all kiddie pool stuff\\, and the pace is strangely dragging in this one too. With only one real physical conflict dominating the film\\, Finn's big dalliance on the casino planet seems an odd move\\, and though every scene extends one character's story or arc\\, not all of them have the same punch. Despite having the most character moments\\, Rey doesn't actually *do* a lot in this one\\, making it feel like we'll have to wait for Episode 9 before she can really come into her own. Still\\, not bad. It's actually a real movie this time and everything!","true":true}
