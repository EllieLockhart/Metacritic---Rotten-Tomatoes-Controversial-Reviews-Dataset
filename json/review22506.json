Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me just say- I've been a die-hard Star Wars fan since I could breathe\\, and almost every second of this movie was fantastic for me. From the amazing music to the intense battles I felt like I was right with the characters. I loved how characters became further developed (cough cough\\, Kylo Ren) and how the directors used that development to further blur the lines between the light and the dark. Overall- one of my favorite movies in the franchise.","true":true}
