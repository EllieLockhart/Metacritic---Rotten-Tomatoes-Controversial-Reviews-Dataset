{"101487":175263,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is another horrific desecration of the Star Wars legacy\\, and aside from that\\, it is just a terrible film that does not function on any level.\\n\\nThe plot\\, for one\\, simply does not work. It is also hard to care about the newer characters\\, who lack depth. Kylo Ren is the most engaging of the bunch\\, but as a villain he has zero menace. It is probably not Adam Driver's fault. He was very good in Girls\\, but the fact remains that the scariest thing he could ever do is invite Lena Dunham to your party.\\n\\nWriter\/director Rian Johnson has had a very good stab at ruining the beloved characters too. The script undermines Luke\\, Chewie is mere wallpaper\\, and Leia flies through space in somewhat ridiculous fashion. There is much more to be said here but I can't bring myself to rake through the catalogue of horrors that form this so-called Star Wars movie. Instead I will just focus on a few of its more interesting points of failure.\\n\\nThe first is tone. Johnson imbues the movie with his usual irony and irreverence\\, which worked well in his debut movie Brick\\, but does not work for Star Wars. It's one thing for individual characters to make wisecracks\\, which used to be the role of the (sorely missed) Han Solo. But the Star Wars universe depends on maintaining a certain seriousness in its depiction of Jungian archetypes and the battle between good and evil\\, especially the good and evil within ourselves. When you poke ironic holes in such a lofty premise\\, there is a danger of the whole thing quickly descending into absurdity.\\n\\nI think it is also a mistake to emphasise the notion that The Force is merely a religion. The original Star Wars movies were a perfectly-realised parallel universe\\, and Lucas was careful not to let things from our world slip in wholesale. Everything was similar but different\\, alien yet recognisable. The Force\\, although very briefly referred to by the Empire as a religion\\, clearly represented many things - spirituality\\, individual agency\\, the desire to be moral\\, the temptation to stray from that path - and much more. As a phenomenon it could\\, and should\\, only be explained obliquely\\, as it was by the characters in the original trilogy. In The Last Jedi\\, however\\, The Force becomes simply a religion\\, presumably one of many\\, or perhaps even a denomination. Here it feels roughly analogous to being\\, say\\, a Methodist Christian.\\n\\nThere are also a few clunking attempts to shoehorn politics into the film. Nothing new for Hollywood of course\\, and quite far down the list of atrocities committed by this movie. The most annoying were probably the couple of references to animal rights\\, one merely a failed bit of comedy involving Chewbacca\\, the other a needless and vomit-inducing addendum after one of many pointless\\, tension-free escapes from some planet or other (planets in the original trilogy were solid and richly elaborated: Hoth\\, Tatooine\\, Dagobah. Now it seems you can just throw a few weird masks on people\\, chuck in some CGI\\, give a quick generic overview and you're done).\\n\\nThese are all relatively nuanced criticisms for what is one of the very worst movies in any genre I have ever seen. I wonder if it can even be called a movie\\, or if it is more accurately a failed attempt at one. It plays like an early\\, far too long cut that was somehow released months from being ready. If it was some unknown movie on Netflix you would turn it off after half an hour.\\n\\nBut of course it is not just any movie\\, it is Star Wars.\\n\\nAs a child I read all the books that were the initial additions to the Star Wars canon\\, most notably Timothy Zahn's excellent Thrawn trilogy. They were brilliantly judged and almost as magical as the movies. The Last Jedi is the exact opposite. We have grown used to this since The Phantom Menace of course\\, and The Last Jedi is perhaps a new nadir in the destruction of everything we will always love about Star Wars.\\n\\nI understand it is very difficult to make a good movie. Nonetheless\\, what Rian Johnson has produced is so evil I think a short stretch in jail would be in order. He needs to take time to think about what he has done\\, and never ever do it again. He should certainly not be let near Star Wars again. The only forces behind this movie are the director's ego\\, politics\\, and sheer incompetence.","true":true}
