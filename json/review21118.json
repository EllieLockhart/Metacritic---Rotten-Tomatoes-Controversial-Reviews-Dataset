Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see it yesterday and\\, from a purely cinematic standpoint it was fantastic.  The score was amazing\\, the scenery was beautiful\\, the starfighter battles were great\\, and the overall cinematography was superb\\, however the Snoke CGI was slightly lacking\\, The dialogue was rough in areas\\, and there were a ton of little errors that rubbed me the wrong way.\\nFor example\\, the starfighters were decidedly easier to hit than in earlier movies.  There was one time when five shots from the Falcon destroyed five tie fighters\\, which made very little sense\\, given the fact that TIEs are built for agility and speed.  Another Space-based critique I have is that the capital ships are really flimsy.  In this movie an X-wing can essentially vaporize a turbolaser cannon in one shot and a couple proton torpedoes can blow up the bridge on a Mon-Cal cruiser. \\nAlso\\, there was a scene where they needed to drop bombs\\, but instead of using a squadron of Y-wings\\, they had these mid-sized ships loaded with a couple hundred bombs.  These bombers made no sense tactically or physically.  They flew around five miles per hour and one stray hit would obliterate the entire ship as well as anything around it.  The also had drop-bays that were seemingly unaffected by the vacuum of space.  The people manning the bays were unaffected when the doors opened.  Maybe these bays were already devoid of air\\, but the people in the bays didn't have anything on to protect them from the vacuum of space.\\nThere are a few more dumb little things\\, like how Snoke's origins remain an enigma and the source of Rey's force-sensitivity is still undefined\\, but I'm optimistic that all will be revealed in the books and Episode IX.\\nThere were times where the dialogue was flat\\, notably in a scene where Snoke was monologuing to Rey and Kylo.  I won't give anything away\\, but he seemed like a 60s comic book villain just boasting about how powerful and intelligent he is.  But overall\\, the script was solid and the humor didn't feel shoehorned-in.\\nSPOILER ALERT\\nMy biggest problem with this entire movie was the treatment of Luke Skywalker.  When we first meet him\\, he's an arrogant jerk who eventually comes back into his old virtuousness.  He says the words \\\"Jedi Religion\\\"\\, which not one single person in Star Wars lore has ever said (besides Han\\, who was using it as a derisive\\, offhanded jab).  And he selfishly gave himself into the force despite the fact that he's the only one powerful enough to wipe the floor with Kylo Ren.  I understand why he did it\\, but his entire character felt so... Wrong.\\nThe Force projection scene was classic Luke\\, and It would've been awesome to see him use that trick on a larger scale (like he does in the \\\"Legacy\\\" EU)\\, or teach Rey how to use it later.\\nIt also just seems stupid that Luke\\, the most powerful force wielder and best fighter pilot in the galaxy\\, would doom his allies to a nigh-impossible uphill battle without him.","true":true}
