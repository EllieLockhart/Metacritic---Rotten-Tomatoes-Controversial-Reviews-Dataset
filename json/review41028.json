Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fell short\\, it wasted incredibly pivotal story lines for main characters and did not deliver on what TFA set up for it. It was almost cringe infused in some parts where you knew Disney were slowly sinking into the story with its bad slapstick humor and the entire Star Wars universe was not utilized like its predecessors. Rian really screwed this one up and its heart breaking for old school fans :(","true":true}
