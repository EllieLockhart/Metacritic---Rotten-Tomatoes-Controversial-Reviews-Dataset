Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the hate amongst fans about this movie is very confusing. This is probably the best star wars movie. It has perfect moments of humor\\, very well done space fighting scenes but most of all\\, amazing fight scenes. There is so much heart and love in here that your emotions will be played with. It is also the perfect send off and love letter to Carrie and her presence in the movies. It perfectly hands over the torch for the future and sends us off with beautiful imagery that take us back to New Hope. ","true":true}
