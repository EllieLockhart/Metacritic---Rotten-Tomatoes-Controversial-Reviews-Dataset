Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought a Star Wars movie could be reprehensible. But this is how far Hollywood have gone. Not because the script is ridiculously lousy. But because the entire film is completely engulfed in SJW\/feminist propaganda. All classic Star Wars themes are sacrificed for the idiology. Now I know how german people must have felt like when they saw propagandamovies in nazi germany in the 1930ies.","true":true}
