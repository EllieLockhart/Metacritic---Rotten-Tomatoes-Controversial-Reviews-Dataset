Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess I shouldn't be surprised that there are so many negative reviews on this site for The Last Jedi\\,  Yesterday I saw it for the second time.  I still think this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever.  I saw episode 1 when it came out in 1977. It's hard to overstate the impact that movie made on films in general. It was so innovative\\, it set a new bar for flies\\, and ushered in the beginning of an era\\, where film makes could create movie out of anything they could imagine. It also had an allegory for the times\\, as the country was just emerging from the horror of Watergate and a President determined to ignore the law and constitution in a dictatorial manner.  Fast forward 40 years and the technology has continued to evolve\\, but the story telling has improved immensely.  No movie is likely to approach the impact of the first Star Wars.  Before seeing the Last Jedi\\, my son and I binged watched every Star Wars films in chronological order of the story\\, including Rogue 1 between Episode 3 and 4.  The Last Jedi really at two levels strikes off in a new direction. When Kylo Ren tells Rey\\, \\\"Let the past die\\,\\\" Kylo Ren says. \\\"Kill it\\, if you have to. That's the only way to become who you were meant to be.\\\" I think he is voice of the Director speaking to the fans of the past.  Don't get me wrong\\, I love the past.  I still think that Sean Connery was really the only great Bond.  But I'm glad to see the franchise move in a new direction with new characters and story lines.  They can't survive recycling the past.  Luke had to die\\, as Ben and Yoda died.  He passed in the same way\\, by disappearing and leaving his cloak.  I'm also glad to see a new and much more diverse set of actors.  John Boyega was terrific as Finn.  Benicio Del Toro is wonderful as the code breaker\\, a combination of quick wit and conniving.  So as Kylo Ren asks Rey to leave the past\\, he is the voice of the Director\\, asking fans of the franchise to do the same.  I highly recommend this film.  Just leave the past behind and you will enjoy as a step into the future.","true":true}
