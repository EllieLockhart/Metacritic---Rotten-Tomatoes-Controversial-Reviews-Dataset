Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie reset the entire Star Wars saga back to the rebellion. No growth\\, no progression\\, no creativity\\, no risks taken or sh*ts given. I never thought I would say this but I miss you George.\\n\\nThey took a big dump all over LUKE and his journey to become and restore the Jedi.\\n\\nWay too long (never thought I'd say that as a Star Wars fan) too slow\\, and the slowest\\, dumbest space chase in movie history.  Since when did Star Wars start ripping off battlestar galactica???\\n\\nI care nothing for these new characters and long for more R2-D2 over BB-Jar Jar.\\n\\nOh\\, and since when can chicken walkers (AT-ST) sprint????\\n\\nDoubt I'll be seeing episode 9 since I don't see the point of continuing to watch a story that's already been told. \\n\\n\\\"The rebellion reborn\\\" - Luke Skywalker WTF Rian Johnson?!?!
