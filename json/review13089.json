Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know what movie the people rating this one so low saw\\, but what I saw last night was epic. It moved the mythology forward (no mitochondria or Jar Jar) and the character development and story were epic. Having been a Star Wars fan since I saw the original 40 years ago\\, I think this was perfection. It was beautiful\\, emotional\\, intense\\, funny and sad. I don\u2019t know why there are so many haters\\, except that they want to be \u201ccool\u201d and above it all. This was an epic\\, exciting movie experience.","true":true}
