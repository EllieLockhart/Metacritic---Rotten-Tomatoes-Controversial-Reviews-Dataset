Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is now a Disney\\, Pirates of the Caribbean\\, style movie. Alone it is a good flick but anyone who is looking to find the magic that George Lucas brought to the original trilogy will be left feeling lost\\, and maybe angry. The Kylo character is better\\, but what they did to Luke is a travesty. The movie refers unto itself\\, \\\"you have no place in this story.\\\" which i thought to be a slap in the face to the trilogy. Cheesy jokes are far to prevalent\\, it's almost as if they don't want us to take this movie seriously.","true":true}
