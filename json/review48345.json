Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why would anyone pay a writer\/director to end such an iconic character like Luke Skywalker in such an awful way? Peter Jackson might as well have had spider-man just show up and high five Frodo in the first movie then never show Frodo again. That would\u2019ve been more explainable than what just happened to Luke. Don\u2019t waste 3 hours of your life watching this garbage.","true":true}
