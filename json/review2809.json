Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie. Possibly ruined the franchise. I left the theater angry and upset with how one of the most beloved characters in cinema's story and death were presented. Absolute disgrace. Terrible plot\\, weak writing\\, and a total disregard for the Star Wars fan base. I can't believe this script was approved. IGNORE THE CRITICS REVIEWS. This is a bad film and the worst Star Wars movie.","true":true}
