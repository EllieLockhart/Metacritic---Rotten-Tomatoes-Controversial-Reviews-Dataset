Ya'll wrong\\, the reason why I really hate the game is because of how they deliver the story and how they force you to like a specific character that should've not been there in the first place.

For those who played and loved the first one will get my point. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN JOEL AND ELLIE!Clearly ND and Neil Druckmann is forcing the game to transition the characters so they could imply their beliefs about feminism and other \\\"woke\\\" stuff. We all know it and we all have seen it. I so **** love the first game that I cannot help myself but to feel bitter and hate about this one. There are so many ways to narrate and deliver the story.

I am just expressing my opinion as a gamer.I rate 2\/10 just because of the insande graphics. story-wise? **** trash.The Last of Us = MasterpieceThe Last of Us Part II = ****\u2026 Expand","true":true}
