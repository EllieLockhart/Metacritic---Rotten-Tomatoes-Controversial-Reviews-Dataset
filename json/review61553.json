That being said\\, this game is a total waste of time for the player. The story is an -okay- concept that is delivered extremely poorly and heavy handedly. A complete assassination of the characters of the original game that ends in a mean spirited and unsatisfying way. If you enjoyed the first game for the relationship between ellie and joel\\, pass this one up as it has nothing to do with that. It manages to make you hate everyone in it and leaves you feeling empty after finishing it. Definitely overstays its welcome for about 15 hours too. Graphics are obviously great and gameplay  is basically the same just flashier with a few new toys. Pass this one up guys\\, dont let the hype get to you. Not even going to go into how there are literally character skin swaps and false lines recorded just to be in the trailers to mislead the consumer about what this game is about. Naught Dog and Niel Druckman **** this one up. Big time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
