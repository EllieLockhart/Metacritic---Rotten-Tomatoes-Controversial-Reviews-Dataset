Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good picture\\, bad script\\, bad storytelling\\, bad (non-existent) character development\\, no worldbullding\\, this is barely a movie to be honest\\, Seeing how well they're doing with Marvel i was hyped to see Disney reviving the Star Wars franchise but now i just want it to die. The prequels were poorly made but at least they had interesting stories\\, characters and built a fascinating world\\, the Last Jedi is just an empty shell. I would have a lot more to say and argue my point but this film isn't worth any more of my time\\, i just want to forget it even exists.","true":true}
