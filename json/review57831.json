Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was this Spaceballs 2 Electric Boogaloo?  Between Wonder Leia in Space\\, Snoke the ultimate baddie getting taken out by a whiny 20 something apprentice\\, or ghost Luke fighting as a hologram and an unhinged Yoda helping burn down the force tree (???)\\, this is a complete travesty.  I had high hopes for Rian after enjoying Looper (yes the Joseph Gordon makeup trying to look like Bruce Willis was gawd awful\\, but the story was solid) but\\, this is just a truly awful mess.  \\n\\nSo\\, how exactly did the characters get to this point 2\/3 of the way into the new trilogy?  They were victorious and in charge after Return of the Jedi.  30 years later\\, Han & Leia are divorced\\, none of the good guys are in charge but we're still given no explanation why that happened\\, Han and Chewie broke again and back on the run.  Now Han dies at the hands of his son\\, Luke is a depressed hermit who commits Force suicide (I guess?) and Leia\\, who they should have killed off heroically\\, is still alive at the end of the film but Disney's CEO promises they won't bring her back with CGI?  \\n\\nWhat was the entire point of Snoke?  If he wasn't a burned up clone body of the original Emperor\\, then how did he get to be in charge?  If he couldn't sense Kylo's treachery\\, then he wasn't in tune too well with the Force was he?  \\n\\nComplete waste of time.  I thought Alien Covenant was the worst movie of 2017 but no\\, The Last Jedi is.","true":true}
