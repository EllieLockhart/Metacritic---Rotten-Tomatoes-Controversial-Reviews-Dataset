Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do yourself a favor: watch it twice. The first time\\, you\u2019ll feel confused - maybe even disappointed that the Star Wars story arcs you love are going in a completely different direction. Take a deep breath\\, calm yourself and take two quotes from The Last Jedi to heart: \u201cLet the past die.\u201d - Kylo Ren \u201cThis is not going to go the way you think.\u201d - Luke Skywalker The second time around\\, I promise you\u2019ll appreciate The Last Jedi on its own. Yes\\, there are a few missteps (e.g. the length\\, and Finn\/Rose\u2019s side adventure). But as a whole\\, The Last Jedi makes an emotional transition from the original trilogy into the new one.
