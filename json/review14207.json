Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get the backlash.  I get people are mad at the direction this movie went.  I get that this may not be the best star wars movie out there.  \\n\\nBut for me personally\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is the \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" of the Sequel Trilogy (both thematically and productively).  I'm not saying it's awful\\, I really liked this movie\\, but there ARE some gripes I have with the movie.\\n- The movie could have cut out a sertain side plot\\n- A character or 2 could have had more screen time\\n\\nHowever\\, there are AMAZING things that were in the movie. The acting is fantastic\\, the story (on the most part) is fascinating\\, and the fact that the Director of the movie had serious grit to make these decisions\\, even if people disagree with him\\, is interesting.  \\n\\nOverall\\, I enjoyed this movie (and that's coming from a somewhat die hard Star Wars fan)\\, but I did have a FEW issues with this movie.\\n\\n8\/10 (on par with Ep. 6)","true":true}
