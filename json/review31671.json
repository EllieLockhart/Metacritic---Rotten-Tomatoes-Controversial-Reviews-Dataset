Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry\\, but as a fan of Sci Fi and Star Wars in particular\\, this was the worst entry into the franchise for fans. It basically takes everything that fans love of the old movies and throws it in the trash. It then takes the most interesting plots from Force Awakens and throws it in the trash. What we're left with is a social and political commentary on wealth distribution and the military industrial complex. This isn't inherently a bad thing\\, but it doesn't mesh well with Star Wars. Would anyone actually be happy if Star Wars ended all Wars in the galaxy far far away?","true":true}
