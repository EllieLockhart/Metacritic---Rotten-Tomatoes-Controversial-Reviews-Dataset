Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow two and a half hours of childhood glee fore seeing the original at movies with mom and dad at age 10. one screen sold out and line around the corner. as soon as I heard the music I was transported back. I look like Luke now\\, gray and tired. loved it.","true":true}
