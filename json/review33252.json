Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sucks crap. Just a remake of Empire Strikes Back\\, except worse. Luke dies\\, Leia survives direct exposure to space because it's a damn Disney film\\, and the Rebels are all destroyed except 20 people in the Millennium Falcon. Unless you believe in blowing Tinkerbell pixie dust out your ass there's no way for there to be an Episode IX worth watching\\, just pack it up and say the Dark Side won. Plus it's just a rehashed piece of crap. Stupid bird things almost as bad as Jar Jar.","true":true}
