Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a piece of crap. Just what a piece of crap.\\nThis new saga is making me look at the prequels with renewed eyes. And I've always hated them. I don'ton't think I will watch episode 9. \\nThe only movie of this new era I liked was Rogue one","true":true}
