Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worried about Rian's new trilogy. Little respect shown for previous Star Wars films while introducing new themes that don't harmonize. Wish to see Lucas return with the vision\\, J.J. and Rian feels like driving blind.","true":true}
