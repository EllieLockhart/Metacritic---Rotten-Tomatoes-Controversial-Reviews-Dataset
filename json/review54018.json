Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can put up with the MCU type of comedy\\, I can put up with Snoke being under used\\, I can put up with Supergirl scene\\, I can even put up with Rose (on second thought\\, no) or the silly ways the new force work. But I can't put up with the portrayal of Luke. There is something fundamentally off with Luke's character that is disturbing to the core. I get it Johnson is trying to portray Luke as a beaten down weary hermit\\, that is fine but when *MILD SPOILER* Luke thought about killing Kylo before he even turned to the dark side?\\n\\nThat shit is way off. That's not Luke. Not the Luke that would risk everything to pull Vader back in when no else believed it could be done.\\n\\nThis is not 'new idea'\\, 'subversive' or 'edgy'\\, it's just bad storytelling. I'm not one of those fans who put OT Star Wars on a shrine or obsessing with fans theories. I welcome new ideas\/directions but I will not tolerate half baked\\, disjointed\\, under developed characters\/stories in ANY movie.","true":true}
