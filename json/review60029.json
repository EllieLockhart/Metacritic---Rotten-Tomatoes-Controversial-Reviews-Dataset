The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is not what I expected. I did not expect such rough treatment of characters. The game\\, in principle\\, did not need a sequel\\, since the answers were given\\, and the points were set. Yes\\, there was an open finale\\, but there was a completion. Heroes went their own way.\r\rAnd what they did here ... I did not like it. Perhaps with me a cruel joke was played by expectations. Sorry\\, but that\u2019s not what I would like to receive. The gameplay is interesting\\, the plot is bad.\r\rAnd now the spoilers. 3... 2... 1...\r\rJoel's death is too dumb. Abby is simply evil. If it weren\u2019t for the storm\\, if it weren\u2019t for the zombies\\, if Ally had shot earlier\\, if ... She just left for banal luck and that\u2019s it. Anyway\\, I didn\u2019t like his death.\r\rThe fact that he will die was understandable from the first teaser in 2016\\, but how it was presented ...\r\rSanta Barbara is some kind\\, given that Abby is the daughter of that doctor from the end of the first part. Well\\, like\\, to kill a character in the first two hours of the game ... it's extremely stupid.\r\rI am offended that from Joel\\, who in the first part was a trap for a billion miles\\, he made an idiot who says his name to everyone in the apocalypse world\\, \u0430nd he doesn\u2019t understand that he is being trapped.\r\rJoel certainly didn't deserve such a dumb death. If they had worked out his death better\\, it would have been cool\\, dramatic\\, and everything like that\\, but not the way it was done in the final version. I repeat: I did not like such a death. It's stupid.\r\rIt is clear that most of the critics were bought.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
