Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The past two Disney Star Wars movies are a huge disappointment. Disney had a golden opportunity to create new stories and add to the Star Wars mythos. Instead\\, they played it safe and stuck to a formula that they know would maximize profits. This movie\\, and its predecessor is basically Avengers with a Star Wars skin. This movie has gratuitous action scenes with no purpose to advance the story. It has meaningless subplots and minor characters that go nowhere for no reason. **SPOILER** : Poe Dameron should be court marshalled and sentenced to life in prison. His insubordination led to the deaths of hundreds of people--also for no good reason; And this guy is treated like an iconic hero? Disney is killing Star Wars.","true":true}
