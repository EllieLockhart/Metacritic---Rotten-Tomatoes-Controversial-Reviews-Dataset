Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a big f*** you to the Skywalker Saga and fans. Two stories Finn and Rose; Rey and Luke changed emotions from hype to dull. Scenes with jokes that were meant to be  serious. Too many references from the processors. A endless space battle of the century. Unnecessary characters such as Holdo\\, Rose\\, and DJ. The Last Jedi feels like a episode 9 movie. The movie was unbreathable\\, confusing\\, and annoying. P.S: Leia should of been the character to sacrifice herself on the cruiser.","true":true}
