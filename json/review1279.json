Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A real disappointment. I was hoping that Luke would train Rey in the ways of the force. I was hoping to see brilliantly dark training sequences full of speculation about fear and hate or hope and light. I wanted Rey to be a powerful unstable Jedi full of adolescent power. A grey Jedi! Instead it was full of gags\\, winking and laughable villains. It was like watching the cast of TFA in a Christmas panto. cr*p. \\n\\nThe last few minutes of Rogue One were amazing! Vader was a bad ass. Luke here should of been a bad ass. But instead we got this weak frightened pathetic shell of his former self. Disney have destroyed LUke Skywalker. \\n\\nThey need to put this behind them and maybe let Gareth Edwards direct the next one because Rian Johnson f@cked this one up.","true":true}
