Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me the standouts in this series are ANH (the original ground-breaker that still works as a stand alone movie) TPM (totally unexpected\\, novelistically thick\\, fantastic visuals) RoTS (a great tragedy -- SW style) and RO (more mature in tone\\, stylistically different\\, excellent characters) and now TLJ (ambitious\\, off-beat\\, emotional -- broke SW so SW could grow beyond copying GL forever).","true":true}
