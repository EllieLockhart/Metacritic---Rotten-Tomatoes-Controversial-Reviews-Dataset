Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4 to 4.5 out of five. There were so many great things\\, but there were also so many nitpicks I can't give it a perfect score. I'd need to give a spoiler review to explain the nitpicks correctly\\, but I'll try. We lose the best mask since Vader\\, but we gain Driver's face for more emoting so I am torn there. Not torn am I for the casino ambiance... it is so Earthlike like many have said. The comedy in the first 15 to 30 minutes did not sit well with me. \\\"Can you hear me now\\\" was funny for about a second until they had a certain baddie turn into a complete imbecile for way too long in the conversation... completely not believable. There was a very odd Chewie plus animal scene that was just \\\"wrong\\\". You can't go for cute plus death comedy at the same time\\, OK? \\n\\nNow with some gripes out of the way\\, the good. Overall Hamill was incredible\\, with the exception of one or two irreverent things they made Luke do. Holdo is very interesting... I was genuinely shocked at the beautifully natural way her scenes flowed. Princess I mean General Leia had some really great spots. Rey and Kylo were electric in their scenes. \\n\\nCan I say the great action scenes were reeeaaallly great. Loved that stuff! The heartfelt stuff was equally powerful. \\n\\nDefinitely a very good movie\\, and I'd recommend it to anybody fan or otherwise. As a matter of fact I need to see it again soon!","true":true}
