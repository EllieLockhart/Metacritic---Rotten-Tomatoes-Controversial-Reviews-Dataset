Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How do these huge franchises always end up in the hands of people who don\u2019t fundamentally understand them? This movie is a dumpster fire. Don\u2019t waste your time or money. Contrary to what some will tell you\\, this movie isn\u2019t trash because wild internet fan theories didn\u2019t pan out. It\u2019s trash because there are too many cheesy\\, out of place (and out of character) jokes and gags\\, the characters (all of them) are handled ridiculously in almost every conceivable way and there are plot holes bigger than a football stadium\\, which retroactively make TFA even stupider and render the OT movies more or less pointless. Don\u2019t believe the positive critic reviews. Most of these \u201ccritics\u201d are either on Disney\u2019s payroll or are trying to curry favor with Disney so they can maintain access to their movies\\, actors\\, sets and properties. This is a bad movie\\, plain and simple. Disney is not only ruining this franchise\\, but they also don\u2019t care that they are. It\u2019s all just a soulless cash grab and a middle finger to the people who have supported Star Wars for 40 odd years. ","true":true}
