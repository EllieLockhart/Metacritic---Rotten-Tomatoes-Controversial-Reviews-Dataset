Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps the most beloved protagonist in cinematic history\\, Luke Skywalker\\, has his storied and revered character utterly emasculated and sequentially killed off.  Fans of the original trilogy are left scratching their heads\\, and possibly quite angry\\, as to why such an unnecessary decision was made.  Disney will likely loose money in the long haul over this bizarre directorial choice.","true":true}
