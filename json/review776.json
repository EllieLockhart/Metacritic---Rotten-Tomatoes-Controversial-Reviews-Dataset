Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An Empire rehash that shits on nearly all of its characters not to mention long time fans of the film. The Last Jedi replaces episode 2 as the worst Star Wars film.","true":true}
