Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the mixed reviews\\, I thoroughly enjoyed this next installment of the Star Wars saga! Certainly\\, it held a few surprises and it's epic moments did not at all disappoint. The character development was phenomenal. Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, and Adam Driver were partciluarly spectacular in their respective roles\\, but all the other actors did such all great job as well. I won't spoil anything for you\\, but it is all must-see film and I can't wait to see where the last film of this new trilogy will take us.","true":true}
