Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie sells diversity but sidelines characters of color\\, turns them into comedic relief and their arcs mean nothing to the story. Does Disney not realize that tasing a black man for comedic relief is not the most progressive of choices?","true":true}
