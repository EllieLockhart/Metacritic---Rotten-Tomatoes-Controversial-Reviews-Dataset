Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hopefully the last time that i'm ever this disappointed ever walking out of a theater ever again. None of the dialogue or actions make any sense. It almost feels like the writers decided to throw a dart at a spinning wheel for just about everything that happens in this movie","true":true}
