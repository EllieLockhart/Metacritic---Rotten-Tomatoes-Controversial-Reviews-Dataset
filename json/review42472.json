Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disaster. It was by far one of the most poorly written comedy movies of this year\\, I can say that at least. It's weird to say this because I had no idea that star wars was ever intended to be a comedy.\\nBut really\\, Disney copied the Empire Strikes Back's plot\\, mixed in with a bunch of time wasting garbage...huge lack of character development\\, complete misuse of the concept of the force\\, REY DOESN'T GET TRAINED. Kylo Ren gets his butt handed to him by a stormtrooper guard\\, there's no lightsaber duel the whole movie\\, and they add in a pointless romance triangle. Huge disappointment.","true":true}
