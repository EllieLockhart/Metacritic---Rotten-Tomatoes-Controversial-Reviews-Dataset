Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was no applause in the theater after we watched it\\, if that tells you what random other people thought of it on opening night. There are so many problems with the story I don't want to spend time listing them all here... Pretty much breaks a flow of momentum between 7-8-9. They tried to make the movie too 'modern' with all the feel-good stuff going on these days.. Much more just don't have time to write the rest.","true":true}
