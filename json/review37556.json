Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a small amount of disappointment to be had with the first third of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\". There is a sense of not caring during this first bit of the film where both the character interactions and plot delivery are performed in a lazy manner.\\nThankfully\\, it's a huge relief that two thirds of the film deliver what needed to be delivered from the continuing\\, beloved franchise: familiar faces\\, action\\, unpredictable plot twists\\, exploitation of character strengths and weaknesses\\, and even moments that will quicken your pulse and make you sit at the edge of your seat. The film performs just well enough for us to wait in anticipation for the next episode. Overall \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a solid entry and nothing more.\\nSpecial kudos to Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver for getting most comfortable as their characters since the last episode. On that note\\, continue to rest in peace Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
