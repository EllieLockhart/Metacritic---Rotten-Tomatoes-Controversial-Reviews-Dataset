Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found myself almost screaming from how good some moments in the last jedi were. That's a thing that this movie does well\\, setting up really interesting and emotional moments that genuinely left me in awe. I absolutely loved my time with the last jedi\\, I agree\\, it's not a perfect movie. The writing sometimes is off\\, you will notice it\\, there is a part in the movie that is flat out boring compared to everything else that's happening \\, but it's nothing major that will ruin this wonderful roller-coaster of a movie. Absolutely recommend!","true":true}
