Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very fun movie\\, but it wanted to be an even longer movie and the cutting shows. There's a sub plot that doesn't quite work and could have been fixed. The tension between it being a movie for kids and a movie for adults was clearly a strain on the writers\\, as was the tension between the new generation and the older generation of characters. They only have so much screen time. Maybe this all should be happening on a small screen.","true":true}
