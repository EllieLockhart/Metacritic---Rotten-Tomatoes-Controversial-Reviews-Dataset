Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dreadful film. Mean spirited at heart. Utterly negates and destroys the character of Luke Skywalker for seemingly no good reason apart from trying to makie a new and uninteresting character appear superior. It's riddles through with plot holes\\, boring in many stretches\\, and has a generally ugly feel to it throughout. There is a new character wedged into the story for no reason\\, a nonsensical side plot on a casino planet that seems to exist only to wedge in a political message and ultimately ends up being pointless to the main plot. The film is an utter\\, incoherent mess. But the worst of it is how it ruins Luke Skywalker as a character. It's complete garbage. Everyone responsible for this film should have been fired before it ever hit theaters. And so long as Kathleen Kennedy is at the helm of Lucasfilm I have no interest in any more Star Wars films.","true":true}
