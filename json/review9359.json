Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets off to a bumpy start\\, but once the film clicks into gear it roars ahead and never stops. Unlike the Force Awakens\\, this is a truly evolutionary Star Wars\\, building on what's been established in the previous movies while avoiding the temptation to peddle in recycled material. The film introduces new ideas to the familiar story of good vs evil while retaining that authentic Star Wars magic.","true":true}
