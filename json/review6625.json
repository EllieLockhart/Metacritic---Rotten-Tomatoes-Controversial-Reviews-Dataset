Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not understand all these positive reviews. Very poorly developed story arc\\, horrible interpretation of star wars cannon. An amalgam of  amazing cinematography and CG effects but 0 substance. SO disappointing. With the budget and talent behind this it felt mailed in.

What did we do Disney Santa to deserve being ripped of like this?","true":true}
