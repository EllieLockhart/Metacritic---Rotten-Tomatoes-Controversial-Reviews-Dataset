There's a big boss battle here that should be explored and expanded if a third installment is introduced. The cordycep zombies mutation gives great opportunity to create great massive enemies. The issues with this game lies in the story. This is spoiler free. I am a big fan of TLOU. This next installment seems to be at war with itself between the story it's trying to tell and the gameplay. A stealth\/shooter game is not the best way to tell this story. This story actually works much better as a movie than it does a game. This story is about revenge\/trauma\/ PTSD\/ guilt\/ and forgiveness. That's a very hard thing to pull off when you are killing countless enemies for entertainment. What you have is a story not matching the avenue that is being used to tell it. There is also too many cut scenes and flashbacks used. It leaves the gamer holding the remote doing nothing and I always advice against it. The first game added a significant portion of it's narrative to the actual gameplay it made it more entertaining. But sometimes\\, when you make choices and write yourself in a corner you have to use flashbacks to get yourself out. Flashbacks are a very weak narrative tool and must be used wisely. This game went too hard at this. This is why the story was average at best which hurts a narrative game's replayability to a certain degree. The gameplay is tense\\, yes there's a form of repetitiveness from it but there's only so much you can do inside the world that was built. It feels tense throughout especially at harder difficulties. Overall\\, I enjoyed playing this game. This is not 10\/10 game of the year material reviewers are saying. It's also not the trash people are claiming it to be because they are mad at the story's direction. It's a solid 7 out of 10 that will inevitably be in the running for game of the year and inevitably lose. From a story standpoint it's weaker than it's predecessor. Most everything else is an improvement. Graphics: 10Voice acting: 10Gameplay: 8Story: 5.5Replayability: 6Overall: 7.9\u2026 Expand","true":true}
