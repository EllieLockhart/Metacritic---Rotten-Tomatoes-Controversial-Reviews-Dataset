Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dumb Dumb Dumb\\,\\,\\, pllot wholes\\, stupid far fetched happenings.. Umm Lei flyign around like peter pan anyone ?\\nJust a copy of Empire and return of the Jedi\\,\\,  really disapointed.\\nOh well at least they didnt have storm troopers getting beat up by little girls with a stick.\\nPlus the Kylo Ren actor is absolutely horrible actor. Comes across like a whiney little brat.","true":true}
