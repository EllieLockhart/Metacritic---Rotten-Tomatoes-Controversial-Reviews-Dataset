Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just an utter insult to the entire Star Wars franchise. Not only have they killed Luke Skywalker\\, they've killed the magic. This film is bland\\, boring\\, uninspired\\, and painfully 'safe.' The humour style is not in keeping with The Force Awakens\\, and there are no truly scary villains (a la Darth Vader) only ridiculous morons. The story could have been somewhat entertaining if this were not Star Wars\\, but something entirely different. But as Star Wars\\, it comes off as just wrong. Its primary point seems to be to teach a lesson\\, but instead of doing so artfully or subtly\\, it bludgeons you over the head with it like a cheesy government-funded PSA. It is subversive for the sake of being subversive\\, not for the sake of the series. It feels as if Johnson hated Star Wars and gleefully revelled in his chance to destroy it.","true":true}
