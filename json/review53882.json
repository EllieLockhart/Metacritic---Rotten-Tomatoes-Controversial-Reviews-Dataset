Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. For Star Wars fans this atrocity butchers beloved characters while breaking previously established rules of the universe while also breaking the laws of our universe such as projectiles experiencing drop or fall off in space or a ship experiencing drag in the vacuum of space. For non fans the only redeeming quality of this film is the visuals. The main character suddenly gains new abilities and powers that deem every other character as useless\\, breaking any and all tension as the audience knows the main character will never fail at anything. There are too many sub plots with not enough time to get invested into any of them while the overuse of bathos\\, or comedy\\, breaks the mood completely in every scene that is set up to be tense or suspenseful. Gaping plot holes are present everywhere\\, the choreography is horrific\\, and the \\\"subversions\\\" are a blatant middle finger to any invested audience members. It cannot even be enjoyed like the Star Wars prequels or The Room as it fails to be entertaining in any and every way possible. I would only recommend this to aspiring film makers who wish to see examples of what not to do or to distract one's pet goldfish. Absolutely horrendous\\, would give it 0 stars if possible as I have seen and read fan made content that are vastly more entertaining than this thing.","true":true}
