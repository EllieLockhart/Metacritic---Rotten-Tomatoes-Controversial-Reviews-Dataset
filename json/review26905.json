Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies I've watched in a long time! I give it a 4 1\/2 as the only thing I didn't like was Luke Skywalker's parts in the movie. A true Jedi never loses hope\\, they stick with the light and are dedicated to fight the dark\\, I would of loved to see an actual lightsaber duel with Kylo and Luke. Other than Luke Skywalker's parts I loved it and I recommend people who haven't watched it to watch it! It's fantastic! Ignore the Audience score as the people who did that are anti-Disney\\, they probably haven't even watched the movie\\, they just hate Disney.","true":true}
