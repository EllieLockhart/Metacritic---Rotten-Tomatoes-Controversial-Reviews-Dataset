{"101487":175016,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a politically relevant film\\, slipping in hints to modern-day talking points? Does it want to be a Marvel film\\, all about humor and explosions? Or does it want to be a Star Wars film? That option seems to be the least likely of the three\\, as the movie doesn't even remotely resemble a Star Wars film.\\n\\nLet's start with the good: Finn and Rose. Both are played by good actors\\, including a virtual unknown in Kelly Marie Tran who was just wonderful. They have such good chemistry together\\, you can see them as the next Han and Leia. The only problem for them is that their entire story arc is rendered moot by other events in the film. Basically they do everything they do for no reason. It seems like a mistake from a fanfic.\\n\\nThe rest of the film is also a bad fanfic. Rey is acted better than she was in Episode 7\\, but she's still a pretty dull Mary Sue who has immense power but no backstory. Why is she so powerful? No reason\\, she just is\\, and too bad if you don't like it.\\n\\nBut the main reason for this film sucking is Luke Skywalker being totally out of character. He isn't even remotely like the guy we grew up with. He tries to kill his nephew? Seriously? Did Johnson and Abrams even watch the original trilogy? Luke would never do that.\\n\\nThe rest of the movie has such ridiculous plot lines that it's embarrassing to even list them\\, but I will. Leia floating in space\\, Rey and Kylo Ren being able to touch each other and have conversations\\, and of course Luke creating his own proxy. Let's not forget the pointless scenes with Yoda\\, and Kylo Ren shirtless\\, which were pure fanservice.\\n\\nOverall\\, if this film did not have the Star Wars name\\, I would probably like it. But it has a reputation to uphold\\, a story to follow\\, characters to develop. John Boyega and especially Kelly Marie Tran were amazing\\, and I don't want to take anything away from them. But the rest of this movie sucked\\, and it's sad to see Star Wars in this shape.","true":true}
