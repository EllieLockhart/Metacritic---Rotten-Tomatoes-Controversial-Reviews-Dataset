Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film and definitely a very good continuation to the already good The Force Awakens. It delivered an intricate\\, appealing plot\\, with interesting new characters and answering some of the answers posed by the previous movie\\, while also presenting a compelling argument for the following sequel.\\nAn absolutely wonderful movie\\, which can be enjoyed by fans and newcomers alike.","true":true}
