Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not even worth half a star. the story doesn't make sense\\, terrible jokes\\, horrible characters\\, unecessary and disturbing cliche twists\\, and the fact that its logic doesn't match up with any other movie of the series just comes to one conclusion: this movie should be excluded from the series\\, and a new episode 8 should be made.","true":true}
