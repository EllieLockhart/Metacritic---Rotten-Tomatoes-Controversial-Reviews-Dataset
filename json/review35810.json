Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is now one of my favorite films in the saga! Kudos to Rian Johnson and Lucasfilm for having the guts to take this film in a different direction. The characters grow immensely from beginning to end and everyone has some interesting storylines set up for episode 9. Sure there were a couple things\\, but I'm not going to complain\\, this was an amazing movie.","true":true}
