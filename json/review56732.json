Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was an abomination to all Star Wars fans. It was so bad it killed the fan in me and my family. Where to start? How about with some of the lessons we learn in the film\\, Rey taught us that family is irrelevant\\, the purple haired Admiral Holdo taught us never to question authority\\, especially female authority\\, from Rose we learn that capitalism is evil (these are communist manifesto themes)\\, and also animals have rights too\\, and men are disposable. Ryan Johnson the director hates the star wars fans so much\\, he humiliated the hero Luke Skywalker and made him a grumpy old pessimist. He killed star wars lore with using light speed as the ultimate weapon (now all you have to do is make some drone ships equipped with light speed to easily take down any Empire fleet or Death Star). I can go on and on and on and on....The one light in the movie was the battle with Snoke. I hope Disney fires Ryan Johnson and starts listening to fans\\, otherwise they will implode","true":true}
