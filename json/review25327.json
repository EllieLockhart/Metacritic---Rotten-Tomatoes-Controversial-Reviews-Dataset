Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No imagination. No consistency. Overt and sloppy attempts to shove warm emotions\\, nostalgia\\, a diversity agenda\\, and whack humor down my throat. 1\/10 will never watch another new Star Wars movie. Literally going to go watch the prequel trilogy and reflect on how much better it was than this.","true":true}
