Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best Star Wars movies to date! Sure\\, the film has a some weaknesses but I thought they followed the essence and meaning of Star Wars perfectly. There are wonderful twists and plenty of mind games which left me dying to see Episode 9 and how things all turn out.","true":true}
