Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a horrendous\\, pointless mess. Zero forward progression from The Force Awakens. They tell you everything you need to know in the trailer with the characters' lines. (ie. - \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\" \\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to.\\\") This movie was visually remarkable\\, but that is about all that it is. It is cool to look at\\, but if you want substance\\, especially Star Wars substance\\, you'll have better luck finding a Jar Jar Binks short story with more cohesiveness and focus than this. I feel bad for Mark Hammil. He did a phenomenal job whilst choking down what is ultimately the most insulting version of the most remarkable and outstanding Jedi in Star Wars lore. Everyone else did okay. It's not the actors' faults that this thing was a train wreck. I signed the petition to strike this from Star Wars canon and remake this atrocity properly and with some dignity and respect. I urge anyone who enjoyed Star Wars growing up to do the same. This is shameful and Disney owes the world an apology but they will enjoy the destruction of this 40 year old wonder all the way to the bank. What a disgrace.","true":true}
