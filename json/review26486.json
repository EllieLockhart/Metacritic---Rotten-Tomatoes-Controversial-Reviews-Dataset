Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Obviously great soundtrack but also astunding sounddesing. Incredible cinematograpgy and stunning visuals. Intense and great acting. Alright story with believable characters\\, few out of character or out of logic decisions.","true":true}
