Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie sets nothing up\\, gets rid of much of what has been previously set up\\, leaves Rey as an uninteresting character who is still more powerful than the only villain still alive\\, Hux is literally a joke\\, there is no character motivation for the enemies\\, the movie lacks continuity with both old Star Wars physics and lore as well as basic physics. Finn\\, one of the most interesting characters\\, is played for laughs\\, Phasma comes back impossible and dies immediately. A third of the movie is pointless\\, Luke is ruined in a way that is impossible for his character. There is nothing to like here.","true":true}
