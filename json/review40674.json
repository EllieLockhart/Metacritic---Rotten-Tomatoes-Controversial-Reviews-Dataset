Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Part of the reason is I have no idea why the good guys are rebels. At the end of return of the jedi the rebellion became a republic\\, during the force awkens the republic had several planets get destroyed so the \\\"rebels\\\" should be republic soldiers. \\n\\nAll the actions scenes were awful. At the start one x wing destroys all the guns on a dreadnaught which is supposedly better than a star destroyer\\, then bombers fly up to it and fly so slowly over it I think I can walk faster\\, then the last one destroys it in a ridiculous manner. \\n\\nMost of the movie is about how the rebel ships are too low on fuel to jump into hyper space but for whatever reason the star destroyers can not catch up to them nor can they do a hyper space jump to catch up to them\\, so a bunch of the characters run around and do stuff while the star destroyers dont destroy the ships. \\n\\nMore boring action scenes happen\\, then eventually one of the rebel ships sacrifices itself to destroy a fleet of star destroyers. What is the point of a star destroyer if an old big ship can destroy a fleet of them? \\n\\nThen they do a terrible awful battle of hoth at the end of the movie except the speeders never actually get to the at at's. \\n\\nUnderstand this is just the action scenes\\, the story is even worse.","true":true}
