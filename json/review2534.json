Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A weak movie\\, that is.\\nNow even though I would have tolerated a middle of the roadish Sci-fi movie with numerous plot holes\\, hollow characters\\, barely any suspense\\, I do not tolerate such a movie if it's a Star Wars. They had the biggest budget possible\\, they could have cast anyone in the world. And yet all they can come up with is a mediocre film. I tried real hard to keep this review spoiler-free but you'll see soon enough if you watch the movie which plot holes i'm talking about. Some of them are quite.......ridiculous. See for yourself...","true":true}
