However the game is let down massively by uneven pacing\\, poor writing and mixed level design that really spoil what is on offer here.\r\rThe elephant in the room: It's no secret that this game had big boots to fill and this series in particular lives on it's story which is in a word quite terrible. The plot has several prominent convenient and immersion breaking plot holes and conveniences that fail to really give a valid reason for it's existence. The characters are poor and do not reflect the excellent character building from the last game and almost deliberately seek to tear them down in a way that is hollow and unfulfilling. Some new characters are good but on the whole most are shallow and not likeable with little core to them that would build the empathy the game attempts. This game can be fun but it is massively overshadowed by this due to it's heavy story focus. There is a bold decision halfway through that makes little sense in how it was excuted. This game would score significantly higher (7-8) if the story was given a directors cut that interspersed the stories with each-other at the same time.\r\rGameplay wise it's more refined and open but again suffers from poor pacing and some areas of really quite awful level design which appears to get worse as the title progressed. You can see at the beginning that they wanted to expand the scope but this is replaced later on by increasingly linear hallway type levels that don't expand the series in any meaningful way.\r\rCombat too is refined\\, but is more of the same and is not really improved beyond some elements of stealth and does little to further the genre.\r\rSound is excellent\\, graphics are great. This on paper could have been a masterpiece but unfortunately it was executed poorly. It is not a bad game and it's not a masterpiece.\r\rI would recommend renting this or waiting for it to go on sale. If you do not like depressing content or really enjoyed the first for it's story I would probably give this a miss entirely.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
