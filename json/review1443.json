Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan I was very disappointed Spoiler Alert We learned why Kylo Ren turned to the dark side but we as we learn he has light on him the story still decides do portray him unnecessarily as a villain Its all Luke\u2019s fault Finn Poe and Rose story was pointless since\\, it doesn\u2019t add anything felt like a filler for the movie Leia should\u2019ve had survived being on space and there is no sound on space either","true":true}
