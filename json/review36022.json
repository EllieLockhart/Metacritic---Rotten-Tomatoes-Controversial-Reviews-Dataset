Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi serves up an epic episode\\, humorous and nostalgic\\, and with a fair dose of reality. Rian Johnson echoes the cinematography and style of the Original Trilogy\\, without recreating the wheel. He introduces so many new themes and ideas that fans will be debating this film for decades!\\nLines are blurred\\, the good guys are not always good and the bad guys not always bad. Even great heroes are fallible. The Last Jedi opens Star Wars up to new possibilities\\, both in the Force and in the many characters. \\nUnfortunately\\, the film's pacing was far to fast for the depth of material and the multiple story lines. We could have spent far more time fleshing out each major character's journey and I would have felt far more satisfied. Perhaps Rian Johnson's original cut was a more whole ad satisfying episode\\, despite being three hours. Star Wars has such fantastic characters; could we spend just a little more time fleshing out their personalities? I'll give up a space battle or two just to see Poe and Finn interact for three minutes.\\nHowever\\, as it stands\\, The Last Jedi is easily in my top three Star Wars films to date. It's a whirlwind ride for sure\\, but one that will be impossible to forget.","true":true}
