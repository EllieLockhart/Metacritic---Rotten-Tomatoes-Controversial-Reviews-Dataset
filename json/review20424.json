Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I used to think Phantom Menace was the worst Star Wars movie\\, but now I'm not so sure.  The only reason I rated it as high as I did is because the cinematography\\, CGI\\, special effects and score are absolutely incredible.  There are several scenes where you will drop your jaw in sheer  awe.  The actual story leaves a LOT to be desired.  There are entire scenes that haze zero purpose in the movie and the Porgs are a distraction throughout.  To put it simply\\, I will not watch another movie written by Rian Johnson.  He has single handedly destroyed everything true Star Wars fans hold dear.  An awful story\\, don't waste your money on a cinema ticket.   Wait till it hits blueray then watch it.","true":true}
