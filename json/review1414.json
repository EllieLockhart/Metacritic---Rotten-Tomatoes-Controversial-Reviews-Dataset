Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, it pains me terribly to write this review. But I have to do it\\, because it's true. Star Wars is dead. Disney and SJWs killed Star Wars. Star Wars was too good for this cruel world. Rest in peace\\, Star Wars.","true":true}
