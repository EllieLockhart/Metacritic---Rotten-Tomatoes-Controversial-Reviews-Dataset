Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In all honesty\\, it wasn't just barely Star Wars. It wasn\u00b4t just barely entertaining. It was barely a movie. Half of the characters are trapped in some sort of circular pointless plot. The protagonists talk about actual interesting topics\\, but act in any but interesting manner. At the end of the day\\, the bad guys are bad\\,  the good guys are good and nothing really happens. I legit believe you will be able to skip this movie and still make sence  from episode VII and IX..","true":true}
