I was trusting the game to come through as its a story is a marathon\\, not a sprint but they never delivered. I didn't want to play as Abby but understood where the game was coming from making me play as her and seeing her POV. I understand that and I do respect that. The game wanted me to see Abby as a human and understand her motives and not just be a one dimensional \\\"bad guy\\\". I did see her POV and I did understand her motives but that didn't change the fact that I hate her and want to play as Ellie again so I can kill her. The section with Abby dragged on WAY too long and when I was forced to \\\"hunt\\\" and then beat Ellie I almost turned the game off for good. I continued thinking that after all this Ellie would finally get her revenge but no\\, 30+ hours and no pay off. The game really expects me to hate Ellie and see her as the bad guy now? Not happening! You've taken one person I care about away in Joel and that was a bold move but I am not turning on Ellie. I was actually ok with Joel being killed if the premise was to exact revenge but you never get it. Abby gets to sail off into the sunset (almost literally) after she got her revenge but Ellie loses everything. You never really see Abby grow as a character and she never shows remorse for what she did to Joel. You see Ellie struggle with some of the things she has done\\, Mel especially\\, collapsing to the floor when she realises she just killed a pregnant lady but no such thing for Abby. In fact when she finds out that Dina is pregnant she says \\\"good\\\" and goes to slit her throat only being stopped by Lev.\r\rThe positives of this game is that it is visually stunning\\, just breathtaking at points and i did enjoy playing it but the story and disappointing\\, stupid unsatisfying ending ruined not just the game but the franchise.   If they make a third game with Abby as the main protagonist (which im really worried they will) I wont be buying it. I feel so let down by how this game ended. 7 years I waited for this and its such a huge slap in the face. \u2026 Expand","true":true}
