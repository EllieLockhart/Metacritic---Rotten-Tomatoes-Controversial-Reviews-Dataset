Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics are reviewing this movie in a sci-fi vacuum and not part of a beloved franchise. It is very shiny and has a few \\\"woo-hoo\\\" moments which are enough to please a critic or a \\\"loyal Star Wars fan\\\". Real Star Wars fans\\, who are angry about this movie\\, saw poor story telling which is inconsistent with past Star Wars stories. De-inventing the tractor beam to have a drawn out space chase was bad enough\\, but disgracing Luke via dubious and out-of-character choices was the deal-breaker. While half the movie-goers did like the movie\\, they were not hurt by their hero randomly changed into seemingly a different person for no reason other than to justify a a hack writers plot. The people that like this movie\\, the so called \\\"loyal fans\\\"\\, would happily watch a turd get flushed for 2 hours as long as the toilet had the words \\\"Star Wars\\\" on the seat. Real Fans hold their beloved IP to a higher standard.","true":true}
