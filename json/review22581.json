Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let The Past Die. Kill It\\, If You Have To.\\\"\\n\\nRian Johnson is able to bring the saga in to our current intellectual time age. The rediscovery of themes like duality\\, transcendence and egolessness was something needed for the Star Wars saga to move forward. Like George did with the original trilogy\\, this movie will bring joy and wisdom to the younger generations who in a long term will be able to grasp these concepts. \\n\\nAgain if youre stucked in the past\\, meaning (an unwillingness to grasp and integrate old important values from a childhood long gone and bringing them forward and developing them to the current adult mind in a post-rational era)\\, this movie will seem totally irrelevant. \\n\\nAs Luke Skywalker goes from the heroic young and innocent into the dark night of the soul only to discover boundaryless enlightenment\\, so should we the audience. Going from the light to the darknes\\, from darkness to light\\, creating grey\\, creating light\\, and landing in emptyness again. Star Wars is again relevant. Looking forward to the upcoming films.","true":true}
