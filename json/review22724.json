Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Listen it just didn't make sense why even build up Rey's backstory I mean I get it but why even hint she's related to anyone because they did or literally build up snoke with zero backstory btw to this god like figure then boom he's dead\\, sorry dumb dumb dumb dumb tried too hard to be funny ran a little long\\, sorry kinda hated it but it looked great and Luke and the like saber battles were great","true":true}
