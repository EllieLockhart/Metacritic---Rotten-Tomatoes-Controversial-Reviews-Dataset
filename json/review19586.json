Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took me time to understand this movie after watching it. Reading many review from critics and users and for me I finally truly understand. Star Wars TLJ is not a Star Wars movie!!! Everything the TFA sets up to move the new trilogy ends with nothing. TLJ is a rewrite of TFA!!! And when TLJ ends there is nothing for the fans to come back to for episode nine. ","true":true}
