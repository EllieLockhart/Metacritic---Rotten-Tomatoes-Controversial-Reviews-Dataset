Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i'm not going to say that I'm an expert critic. But this movie was a complete let down. From the start of the movie it was very obvious that this movie was going in a completely different direction than the last movie. Maybe it was because of having Ryan Johnson work on it rather than JJ Abrams. Almost felt like both of these guys had completely different visions for Star Wars. The quote \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" is taken literally in this movie.","true":true}
