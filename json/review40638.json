Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is to film as Michael Jordan taking up Ping Pong would be to sports.  How in the World does someone squander as much potential as the Force Awakens set up for them?  I'm not sure the guys making this movie had ever seen a Star Wars film before.  Incredible disappointment.  Other than that\\, it had some pretty visuals.","true":true}
