Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage. Wow!!! I'm not sure what movie the critics saw. If you watch close in one scene you can see an X-Wing jump a space shark!!!! Mickey Mouse is the new Sith Lord. Millennials like PC crap movies so I am sure this will do well.","true":true}
