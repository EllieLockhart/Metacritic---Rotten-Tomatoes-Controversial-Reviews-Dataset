Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely dreadful. Never did it once cross my mind that a movie could be worse than the prequels\\, but they actually did it. I have no idea how this movie is getting such good critical reviews\\, the script was an absolute mess\\, it was childish\\, it was not Star Wars. The poor mishandling of Luke Skywalker in this film cannot be understated. While Mark Hamill gave an incredible performance\\, Luke Skywalker was given the shaft in this movie\\, and was not given a moment to shine. Absolute garbage. NOT STAR WARS!","true":true}
