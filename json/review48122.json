Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there are scenes and characters in this movie that made little to no sense (The code breaker definitely. Rose and Holdo to an extent) there are still many great moments in this film that are visually stunning and add more depth to the star wars cannon. The performances are great all around and the Rey Luke and Kylo scenes are well done. This film takes risks that backfire\\, but some of them stick a perfect landing!","true":true}
