Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie\\, plot holes the size of planets\\, mishandled and unnecessary characters\\, movie doesn't continue the story of The Force Awakens in a believable manner. Because of the ending the story has nowhere to go in the next movie.","true":true}
