Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE AUDIENCE REVIEWERS ARE LIARS! Notice how every audience review says there are tons of plot holes\\, but they never give you a single example of plot holes? I just got out of the movie. There aren't plot holes. Don't believe these pathetic internet kids... They exist to give bad reviews because their lives are miserable and they could never be capable of creating something like this. Don't forget: all of these audience reviewers are liars. The Last Jedi is amazing and any real Star Wars fan will enjoy it.","true":true}
