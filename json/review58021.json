Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there are some minor flaws with the film\\, overall this movie is a fantastic entry to the saga. \\n\\nFlaws:\\n-Some weird transitions between shots which leads some scenes feeling slightly disconnected\\n-Some questions from The Force Awakens are not answered or wrapped up in unsatisfying ways\\n-Character deaths are slightly underwhelming\\n\\nOther than that\\, The Last Jedi is a fantastically written movie that at points stuns audiences and takes you on surprising adventures that develop characters in new ways. The story is not derivative as many say and overall introduces an entirely new structure of storytelling that breaths fresh air into a franchise that began to become rather repetitive. The action sequences are absolutely fantastic\\, at times awing with beautiful shots and camerawork. The performances from both the main and side characters are very good\\, especially that of Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Adam Driver. This an overall fantastic film and I rank it number 2 on my list behind The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
