Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily the second best starwars film ever made. If you are interested in film as an art form and starwars being more then a collection of laser swords and space battles you will probably like this film. If however you dont like movies that make you think you will probably find it soso. Last Jedi is by no means a perfect film but the truly great films never are.","true":true}
