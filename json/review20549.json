Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've loved Star Wars my whole life.  My introduction to the films was Return of the Jedi when I was five years old.  Since 8've watched them all at least 10-20 times.  They've always been everything a movie experience should be...tense\\, exciting\\, compelling\\, etc...in short\\, it's simply a fun 130+ minutes\\, and that matters.  Not all of the films are equal by any means\\, I certainly have a Top 5 (Empire Strikes Back\\, The Force Awakens\\, Return of the Jedi\\, Revenge of the Sith\\, and Rogue One).  However\\, I've left each one with a sense of excitement and optimism.  I'd see them in the theater 6+ times\\, watch them more when they came out on VHS and now Blu-Ray.  I'd ponder them\\, dissect them\\, discuss them (probably too much)\\, speculate on them (maybe even obsessively)\\, and always look forward to more of them.  So though I realize that they are only movies and there's so much more in this life\\, it still deeply saddens me that all of this came to an end in The Last Jedi.  To forge a hero in Luke for 40 years and then to treat his character like that is offensive and\\, even worse\\, heartbreaking.  To raise so many questions in The Force Awakens that thrilled and excited fans\\, and then not only fail to address them but dismiss the fact that any of it ever mattered is shortsighted.  And to be so dismissive of everything that ever mattered (for 8 films and 40 years) is selfish and arrogant on the part of the filmmaker.  Director Rian Johnson has extinguished my optimism\\, hope and excitement for the franchise.  I actually resent him\\, and thus Disney and Lucasfilm for permitting him to do this.  And though I recognize that maybe J.J. Abrams can reconcile some of this in Episode IC\\, I feel that it may be beyond repair and is already \\\"going down a path I cant't follow.\\\"","true":true}
