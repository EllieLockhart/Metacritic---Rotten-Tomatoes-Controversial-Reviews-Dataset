Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The franchise obviously has a recipe they are sticking to.. TLJ is a mix between Episode 4 and Episode 5. Same roles\\, different characters\\, with a little twist. I enjoyed the movie but felt that it was unfinished. There were a lot of things introduced that deserved more attention and depth. Additionally\\, this movie will be the gateway drug to more of the content from third party novels\\, particularly with Leia. Some VERY big steps were taken plot and cast-wise.","true":true}
