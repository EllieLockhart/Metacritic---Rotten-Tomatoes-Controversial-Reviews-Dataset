Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disregarding and ignoring many of the things that made Star Wars what it is\\, I guess this is what Disney and Rian Johnson meant when they proudly announced that everything would be different and new. \\nUnfortunately \\\"new\\\" means ignoring the complete narrative of the previous trilogies\\, telling us a story that merely happens in a few hours. Instead of giving us an epic space saga that takes place over years\\, telling the journey of a generation and has a real impact on the galaxy\\, we get the lamest chase of movie history. In a normal Star Wars episode\\, the content of this chase would have been told in like 20 minutes and then the movie would have moved on to more important stuff. New spaceships\\, worlds and a actual new view on the galaxy and the overhaul saga? Nope\\, we get more of the same old shit just wrapped up. Empi... eh I mean First Order vs. Rebels. I guess we will see X-Wings\\, Tie-Fighters and Star Destroyers shooting at each other for the next 20 years\\, because thats it what Disney thinks Star Wars is. \\nAside from that\\, Rian Johnson proofed again that he is simply a terrible director. I did not like his movie \\\"Looper\\\" at all\\, and here again he shows a missing sense for pacing and compelling storytelling. The \\\"story\\\" is told in an almost agonizing way\\, never bulding up any real tension\\, filling it's lack of substance and vision with many unforseen \\\"twists\\\" to shock the viewer\\, desperately trying to look more clever than it actually is. Sadly most of this dosen't work at all and makes no sense and is in there\\, just for the sake of it. \\n\\nThis is the first Star Wars movie I really\\, really didn't like at all. I'm not a huge hardcore fan\\, I have never read any of the books\\, comics etc. I grew up with the PT and loved that one and I saw the OT like a hundred times and will always love them\\, even TFA was fine. But this one dosen't feel like Star Wars to me. \\n\\nThe movie gets 1 and a half from me\\, due to good effects and overhaul good actors. I really like the new cast they assembled. Especially Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver are great actors\\, which makes the movie even worse for me\\, because he does literally nothing with its potential.\\n\\nMy last hope for the franchise is J.J. Abrams who is obviously a superior director and might be able to safe this mess. For the moment the story is just so confusing\\, un-epic and not like Star Wars at all\\, that im not sure anyone can really lift things up here.\\n\\nAside from that\\, fans might have to be honest to themselves\\, accepting that the one and only true vision of Star Wars was the one we got from George Lucas. Everything Disney does is just high budget fan-fiction.","true":true}
