Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"iN one sentence this is disappointment.\\nIs this a bad movie? No. But it is not a good movie. As a Star Wars fun\\, I am disappointed. It has plot holes\\, misused characters\\, some of the worst comedy moments (not counting Jar Jar)\\, butchers old characters at the expense of not known characters\\, puts two-dimensional women for sake of sticking them in\\, go against what we saw in previous movies (Star Wars lore)\\, sticks \\\"sell-able\\\" toys left and right\\, and of course promotes lots of political agendas\\, which is such a shame\\, because some of the visuals are breathtaking\\, some of the concepts are interesting (albeit poorly executed)\\, ships design\\, costumes\\, and creatures (minus Porgs) are great.\\nBut to put the question \\\"is this a bad movie?\\\" in perspective - I'd rather watch Episode 2.","true":true}
