Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is boring\\, humor is not funny\\, a bad drama\\, a copy of the fifth episode. Draining of the main villain\\, a strange connection between Ray and Ren\\, which at the end of the film does not explain. It could have been made more interesting if Ray and Ren were on one side\\, and Snok? or Luke on the other. Anyway\\, the end of the film upset me.","true":true}
