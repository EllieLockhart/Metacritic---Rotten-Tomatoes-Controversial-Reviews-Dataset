Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest\\, this film was a bit of a let down. The story was jumpy and relied a bit too much on cg. It has a George Lucas feel all over it. It had some great moments don't get me wrong. But not enough to save it. There were too many jokes for starters\\, it felt a bit like a sci fi comedy at some points. Too many new characters who brought very little to the plot. Half this film could have easily been cut out. There's too many questions left to answer or were unanswered. It also relied on recurring characters from previous films and had them for only a few minutes. I had trouble finding a steady flow throughout. I felt very disappointed walking put the cinema. Hopefully Episode 9 is a bit better.","true":true}
