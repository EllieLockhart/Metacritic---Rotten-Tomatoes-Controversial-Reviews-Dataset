Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes too many chances in the wrong areas\\, and succumbs to something even worse than the dark side\\, politics.\\n\\nFar far away from any meaningful commentary on gender roles\\, or any thoughtful dialogue on war\\, what we as the audience actually get is like a watered down\\, well\\, Disney movie. A Disney movie that throws characters (literally) and world building out of the window. That is\\, assuming that the gravity switch is set to \\\"ON\\\" in any given scene. \\n\\nThe film is such a mess of illogical stupidity and blind liberalism\\, from gravity literally functioning or not functioning based on the convenience of the scene\\, to characters doing things incredibly against their nature\\, almost NOTHING in this movie makes sense. The movie is essentially a fireworks show. Sure it is pretty to look at\\, but at the end of the day\\, leaves you with a kind temporal awe that feels like a bad dream. Events that should carry weight and nuance feel like attempts at being risky for risk sake.\\n\\nJust awful. \\n\\n---Should you see it?---\\n\\nHonestly\\, no. You really aren't missing anything. If someone paid for my ticket I would probably see it\\, but only to make fun of how bad the movie is. Wow\\, and I didn't even mention the completely useless asian girl.","true":true}
