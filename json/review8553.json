Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First let me just say because of the Finn\/Rose storyline on the gambling planet\\, I can only give this movie an 80%. Other than that aspect of the movie\\, everything else is incredible. Rian Johnson has restored mysticism to the force\\, thank you.","true":true}
