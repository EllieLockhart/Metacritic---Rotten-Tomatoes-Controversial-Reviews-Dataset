We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I give it four out of ten. One point for the visuals. One point for the music and sounds. Two points for the flashbacks with Ellie and Joel. The rest was pretty pathetic in my opinion. First off\\, the end left me empty\\, no joy\\, happiness\\, or hope. I bought this to entertain me but feel like I was slapped in the face\\, over and over again. Foolishly I kept playing thinking it would get better. Second\\, who thought it would be a great idea to make players play as Abby?!? Bad move! I feel like the 40% or so playing as Abby was a complete waste of time. This is not what we signed up for. To drag it out as long as her part is was stupid. I get it\\, you were supposed to start to like Abby. Well\\, that didn't work. What makes it even worse is you have to play as Abby when up against Ellie. Just why?!?Finally\\, the story felt like it was missing parts\\, liked they had to cut things out to complete the game on a schedule. The artwork that's in the bonus section somewhat backs this up since there are pictures of things that didn't make it into the game but probably should have been. It will be interesting to hear the behind the scenes discussions. Perhaps some of that is mentioned there. The writing didn't feel as solid as in part one.Overall\\, the game mechanics\\, audio and visuals are where they need to be. The story was not what I had hoped for and not anywhere near as good as part one. I wont be playing this again for sure. Not surprisingly Gamestop will only pay like sixteen bucks for it after just a few months. I guess this will sit on a shelf and collect dust reminding me how's bad it is. Don't even bother making a part three.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
