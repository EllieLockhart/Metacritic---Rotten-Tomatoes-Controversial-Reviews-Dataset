Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As not much of a Star Wars fan I was still incredibly disappointed with this film\\, it both fails as a sequel as it just unceremoniously clears the board of the plot threads raised by the previous film and yet doesn't add anything in their place except for big explosions and weird \\\"why did they do that??\\\" moments. It relies so heavily on having seen the other films that it even fails as a standalone film unlike the previous film that was an enjoyable experience even if you had no idea what a Jedi was or who Darth Vader was. This film feels genuinely hampered by the characters it's been given and has no idea what to do with them\\, so it just keeps them busy while the main \\\"plotline\\\" is dragged out for far longer than the situation could ever possibly have lasted (it's like interspersing scenes of someone making toast into another film and leaving the audience wondering how it could have taken that long to toast and butter two pieces of bread). Put simply\\, this is a mess of a film and I'd come to expect much better from Disney.","true":true}
