Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a Star Wars fan since I was kid in the 80s.I liked all the films including the prequels\\, I've watched Clone Wars and Rebels\\, I enjoyed Force Awakens I although had a few minor issues with it\\, loved Rogue One. Last Jedi looks amazing\\, hence the 1 star\\, but beyond that it is a mess of plot holes\\, poor story telling and disregard of the source material even as recent as ep7. The plot holes are too many to mention here\\, the writing was just awful\\, plot lines weak and  I explanation given for Snoke and weak backstop for Rey. Then there's the treatment of Luke\\, disrespectful to the character\\, the fans and Mark Hamill. There is far too much political points scoring going to the detriment of the actual plot. I enjoy strong female characters in films (like Jyn Irso) but much of their inclusion in this film feels contrived and forced. We go to watch films like Star Wars for escapism not to have political talking points shoved down our throats. The humour was misjudged and unfunny and the funniest part was leia flying through space which wasn't even meant to be funny. I fear for the future of the franchise if this is the direction Disney and Lucasarts continue to follow. Really disappointing\\,  it's going to take something massive to turn this around and I'm just not sure it is even going to be possible. As Luke nonchalantly throws away his old lightsaber after Rey hands it to him\\, Disney\\, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have nonchalantly thrown Star Wars away.","true":true}
