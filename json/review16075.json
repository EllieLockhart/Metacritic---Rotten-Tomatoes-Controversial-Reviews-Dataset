Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m an avid Star Wars fan and I don\u2019t understand the really mixed reviews of this film. Was it overhyped? Yes. Did it completely meet expectations? No. But it was overall a gold Star Wars movie. The biggest problem that I have with this film is the clunky build up to craft the story. If could have certainly been stream-lined and more effectively set up the mind-blowing last hour of the film. People are complaining about Rey\u2019s parentage and snoke\u2019s death and so on and so forth\\, but remember\\, there is another film in this saga\\, and I have a feeling there is more information to come. Overall it was fun and exciting with many cool\\, new signature Star Wars moments. It deserves more credit from audiences than it is getting.","true":true}
