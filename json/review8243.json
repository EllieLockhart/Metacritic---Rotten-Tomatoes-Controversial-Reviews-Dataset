Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic visual effects\\, absolutely second to none.  However given that that this is Star Wars\\, the world's biggest Sci-fi franchise (in addition to now having Disney's money behind it) this is a bare-minimum expectation.  This film failed to capitalise on any of the plot points set up in the previous film and did a great deal of disservice to the characters it borrowed from the original trilogy.\\n\\nOn top of the character issues\\, the film played out like a string of highlights from episodes 5 and 6 strung loosely together with the universe's slowest chase scene\\, and the First Order\\, who were introduced as a very dangerous adversary at the beginning of The Force Awakens have been reduced in The Last Jedi to a bungling troupe of clowns whose repeated incompetence from the outset is the only reason that the credits weren't rolling a few minutes into the film.\\n\\nOn the whole this was a very poor showing and has ensured that the upcoming Episode 9\\, instead of riding the crest of a wave\\, has a mountain to climb to try and recover the franchise's credibility moving forward into the next phase of films.","true":true}
