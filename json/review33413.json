Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Taking Star Wars in the wrong direction. This isn't Guardians of the Galaxy. Nostalgia is what makes Star Wars great\\, don't treat it like dirt. Going to sign that petition now. Also made this account solely to express my disappointment. Can't wait to see if the third one is somehow worse.","true":true}
