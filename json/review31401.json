Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some nice effects and action scenes are not enough to overcome a plodding\\, confused\\, and frankly insulting story that trashes characters we love to make room for make room for overbearing and poorly-written new characters.  This film goes out of its way\\, and trips over its feet doing so\\, to 'subvert' the audience expectations\\, but not in ways that delight\\, but in ways that shock and simply frustrate.  So many story ideas set up by Episode VII are tossed out for a quick gag or ideological grand-standing.  The more I think about TLJ\\, the less I like it.  I wish we just just press the Undo button and start over on this one.","true":true}
