Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie redeemed The Force Awakens. It was very different\\, but good different. It wasn't the same rehashing of old classics like the rest have been. It went it's own way & took its own direction. It introduced very exciting elements of the force that the others didn't. It redeemed the idea that anyone can be a Jedi\\, not only people with \\\"midichlorians\\\". It's fresh\\, serious\\, deep\\, fun\\, sensual\\, & unique.","true":true}
