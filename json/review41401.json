Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an epic waste of time and the bribed film reviewers who need to be invited to Disney's red carpet events are no longer trustworthy. I don't want to rant here but I want to outline bullet points of everything that is wrong with this film.\\n\\n- Plot holes galore. The main one being Finn and Rose's subplot which was seemingly put in their to make social justice commentary.\\n\\n-A nonsensical storyline (when did ships run out of fuel in STARWARS) that is a direct copy of the Empire Strikes Back\\n\\n-A disservice to the legacy of Leia and Luke (especially Luke)\\n\\n-A story where no one accomplishes anything and nothing is advanced.\\n\\n-Cute animals were thrown in there for product placement.\\n\\n-Giving the fans the middle finger by not answering or advancing setups from episode VIII (Who is Snoke\\, who are the Knights of Ren\\, who is Captain Phasma\\, how did the 1st Order come to Power\\, Rey's lineage\\, and the reasons for her insanely powerful force abilities).\\n\\nSkip it if you don't want to be angry with the selling out of a classic and timeless story.","true":true}
