Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Frigid fanboys are giving low ratings to The Last Jedi because their shitty theories weren't even taken into consideration. Oh well\\, if I wanted to watch another \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\"\\, definitely I'd watch \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and that's all.\\nAlthough some scenes seem odd\\, the movie has a solid plot and the balance between the dark and light side of the force is thrilling.\\nFunny\\, unpredictable\\, risky\\, and an unusual Star Wars movie that leaves behind the safe and conventional path. Loving this new turn of events.\\nDon't be afraid to embrace the new.","true":true}
