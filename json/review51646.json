Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A decent mainstream science fiction movie if it were not part of the Star Wars franchise. The movie is clearly targeted at a younger audience and has been strongly influenced\\, for better or worse by current political positions.\\n\\nThe sense of humour in the movie\\, although funny and probably fitting for Guardians of the Galaxy it a little too slapstick and immature for what most fans would expect from a star wars movie. As a related element the villains of the piece have been stripped of all menace or gravitas becoming comically incompetent.\\n\\nThe pacing of the movie is poor\\, it is far too long while simultaneously feeling rushed and weakly explained. \\n\\nThe messages of the movie seem inconsistent with the previous Star Wars mythos while also managing to seem inconsistent within the movie itself.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether Abrams can rescue the franchise.","true":true}
