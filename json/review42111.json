Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie reminded me of a Michael Bay Transformers movie.  It jumped from scene to scene without a lick of cohesiveness.  Zero character development.  Scenes were slowed down for \\\"added\\\" effect.  I think we reverted back to the 1999 installment of the Matrix a few times between all the lightsaber fights.\\n\\nAny answers from questions in TFA were either left unanswered or thrown down the trash chute into a big pile of dump with the rest of this movie.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead: I almost walked out of the movie upon seeing Leia magically float through space.  The casino scene...DJ....huh?  They continuously threw in undeniably movie killing \\\"ha-ha\\\" moments that pulled you away from the seriousness of a scene.  At some moments\\, you question whether you should root for  the resistance\\, hope that the First Order just finished them off\\, or hope that something new altogether forms to destroy both sides.  At moments\\, you could believe that\\, but then\\, nope\\, insert a new hope in our underwhelming slave Jedi with apparently zero family heritage into the Jedi.\\n\\nAt times I felt like we were in a Doctor Strange movie with all of the mindless astral projection going on.\\n\\nThe acting in this movie saved it from permanent\\, irreversible  repercussions.  If you are under the age of 10yrs old\\, and are looking for a surface level space war\\, this movie is definitely for you.\\n\\nYou have to watch this movie so you can disengage from the Star Wars franchise.  Being a life-long Star Wars fan\\, it hurt me to see this movie as the end result of a franchise heading in a never-ending money sucking direction.\\n\\nYou'd swear that Rian Johnson and Michael Bay collaborated on how to successfully destroy a franchise.  Utter disappointment....","true":true}
