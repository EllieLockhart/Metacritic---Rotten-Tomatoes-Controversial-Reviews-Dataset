Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While there were loose ends and some unsatisfying moments\\, overall the movie was highly entertaining and visually impressive. Ultimately the final movie will decide the fate of this trilogy in how it seeks to clear up the confusing moments in The Last Jedi and bring the storyline to a satisfying conclusion.","true":true}
