Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***spoilers*** okay\\, let's start with the things that are undefendable and SHOULD make people upset. First off\\, Leia in space was executed poorly. it's not unreasonable to think she could survive space with a force cacoon\\, but the way they portrayed it was just.... it could've been done better. then there's the slap stick comedy that was I'm the first 2 minutes of the film. wow\\, was that cringe worthy. and then the last terrible thing about the movie is debatable and is what I think is dividing the fans. Luke not going full badass or doing anything truly cool is indeed disappointing\\, but he did serve a purpose to the story. okay\\, now to the good... and there is a lot of good stuff. Even though this is the first non-spinoff film to not feature a lightsaber battle in the traditional sense\\, there is a battle with lightsabers that can easily be considered one of the best action scenes in star wars history. the space battles were memorable. kylo Ren killing snoke was surprising. the movie as a whole was just overwhelmingly good and people shouldn't let the few hiccups ruin the entire movie (or their entire veiw on star wars) experience.
