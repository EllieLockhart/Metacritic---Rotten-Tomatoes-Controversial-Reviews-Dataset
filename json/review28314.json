Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"poor writing and pointless plots made this a bad movie.\\nThere are 10 movies in the franchise. 3 great films and 7 bland to down right terrible films. Mathematically this franchise is now a rotten apple. I used to be a fan... what happened?","true":true}
