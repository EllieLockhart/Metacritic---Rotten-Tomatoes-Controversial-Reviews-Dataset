Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some beautiful shots and one amazing fight sequence\\, aside from that the films falls pretty flat. There was a lack of progression in the story\\, several unnecessary cringe worthy moments and overall a lack of interesting character development. Had high hopes but I was disappointed.","true":true}
