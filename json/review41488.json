Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is AWESOME! Don't let the boys drive down the audience score! Diversity in all universes is essential and I love Star Wars for all the strong\\, positive influences of all colors \\, backgrounds and genders!","true":true}
