Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible treatment of Luke Skywalker. Bad pacing. Bad undertstanding of how the star wars lore and canon work in previously made movies\\, such as but not limited to the mary sue character Rey. No training no failing no character growth. Crapped on other characters such as Poe and Ackbar to fuel a story that didnt make sense. Im glad the fan base has EU novels and comics because they need to do alot of work to save the franchise with TROS","true":true}
