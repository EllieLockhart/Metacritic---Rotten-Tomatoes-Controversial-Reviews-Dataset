Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes risks not taken in The Force Awakens\\, which his bound to upset some (or apparently a significant number of) fans. But to me\\, the risks paid off. It plays things very smart\\, redeeming in many ways plot holes and inconsistencies in the prequels\\, and above all righting the the gradual loss of the original focus\/philosophy behind Star Wars over the years. Minus half a star for how some characters were handled.","true":true}
