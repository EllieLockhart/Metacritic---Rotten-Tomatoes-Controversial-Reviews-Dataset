Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heartbroken... not happy with making a bad movie\\, RJ and Disney have ruined the original trilogy and the legacy of one of cinema's most enduring heroes. I wish I could erase the memory of TLJ from my mind as I can't go back and watch the original trilogy now knowing the fate of Luke's character. Seriously\\, what hasn't Disney done for the franchise?!! They remade A New Hope with The Force Awakens\\, a movie that didn't need remaking\\, but that was tolerable as it brought back SW and a new trilogy and set up intrigue for episode 8. TLJ was too important in the whole saga to screw up\\, but to screw it up so emphatically??!! Way to go Disney\\, way to go Rian Johnson. As a fan of 41 years I will not be seeing episode 9\\, no interest\\, and that truly hurts me to say. HOW COULD YOU HAVE GOT IT SOOOOOOO WRONG?????!!!!!!","true":true}
