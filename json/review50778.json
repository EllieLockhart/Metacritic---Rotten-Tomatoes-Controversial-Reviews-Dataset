Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautifully made bungle\\, complete with a vacuous\\, wandering narrative\\, awful attempts at comedy and dozens of world-breaking events throwing the cinematic universe of Star Wars into a postmodern crisis of meaning. We would all be much better off if this movie had never been made. Quality acting and beautiful sets simply cannot make up for the tragic immolation of so much content built up over the last 40 years. Utter irresponsibility on behalf of Disney.","true":true}
