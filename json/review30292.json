Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Scenerio is so bad\\, that I want to cry in cinema. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kenedy gave us a hell of a ride\\, with bad script\\, dialogues\\, idiotic scene with Lea in space and more. Shame on YOU Disney\\, Shame on YOU. Plus Rey\\, she can do anything without training. Pity.","true":true}
