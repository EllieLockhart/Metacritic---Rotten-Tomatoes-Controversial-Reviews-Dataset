Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think it was as good as the Force Awakens. \\nWe find out Rey just has \\\"nobody\\\" parents\\, really after all the hype from the first one\\, thats what we get?\\nKylo kills Snoke with ease and we never get a background on him\\, when Snoke should have been the main antagonist\\, like the emperor was. \\nLuke projects himself and just fades away after\\, really that's what we get from the Master\\, if felt like an injustice to him being killed off like that. According to Lucas\\, Luke is the most powerful Jedi to ever exist\\, and he just fades away...no force battle\\, nor sabre battle...just sad.\\nThe casino scene seemed pointless\\, just there to give Finn something to do\\, and the humor in the movie just didn't fit the scenes at times like it was just forced in.\\nI think Rian Johnson could have done this so much better. I was let down\\, especially to all these builds ups we had from the Force Awakens.","true":true}
