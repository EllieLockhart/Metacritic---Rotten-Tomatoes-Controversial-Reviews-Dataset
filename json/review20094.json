Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not a good movie.\\n\\n1) Entire plotlines went nowhere.\\n2) Many logical problems that should have been thought through. Viewer is constantly asking why didn't they do this or why did they do that? How did they know ...? \\n3) Characters act out of character. While some may enjoy the deconstruction\\, it was handled very poorly and in an unsatisfying way.\\n4) Makes all the weird\\, mysterious stuff from The Force Awakens pointless. In this sense\\, not only is it a bad sequel\\, it makes the previous movie worse.\\n\\nI have no desire to watch it again.","true":true}
