Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi delivers the thrills\\, the emotion\\, and the jaw-dropping visuals in spectacular\\, innovative ways to the fans! The opening and final acts will have you on the edge of your seat! While The Force Awakens was an excellent homage to the 1977 original\\, Episode VIII makes it a point to break new ground\\, while channelling the best parts of Empire Strikes Back and Return of Jedi. The entire cast is in top form\\, but Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher\\, just like Harrison Ford in TFA\\, do their best work in the series! Last Jedi is the longest instalment yet\\, but so much happens that by the time the end credits roll\\, you truly feel that you've gotten your Star Wars fix and then some!","true":true}
