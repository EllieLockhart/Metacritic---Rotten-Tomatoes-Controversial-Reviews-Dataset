Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"42\\, still know the original trilogy verbatim\\, even enjoy the prequels as fun (but very bad movies)\\, but this...first time I've ever been bored with a Star Wars movie.  And it's idiotic.  Shameful.","true":true}
