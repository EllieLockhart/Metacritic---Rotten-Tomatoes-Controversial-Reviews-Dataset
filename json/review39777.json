Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an amazing star wars movie. Bold and risky move by Rian but it is refreshing to see. It is one of the best star wars movie ever made. Visually stunning cinematography woven with emotional moments will surely tug at your heartstrings. Character challanges are dealt well\\, the choices they make\\, the consequences of it all may not go the way we think or want but it is necessary for their story arc. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver are definitely at their best performance here. Overall this is a deep\\, layered star wars movie with amazing acting\\, stunning visuals and great directing.\\n\\nP.s. One needs to watch this movie\\, pay attention to details\\, process and understand it\\, then come up with your own opinion. Don't let the salty \\\"fans\\\" complaints deter you from watching this. Experience it yourself.","true":true}
