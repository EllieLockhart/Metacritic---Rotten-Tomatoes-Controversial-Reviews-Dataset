Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outside the visuals and special effects this movie was terrible....it was more of a cartoon Starwars Rebels episode than a part of trilogy...also I am not a faker reviewer and I am not russian.  The critic review was so appalling that i had to register and make a review as this movie is ranked too high...\\n\\nThe story and plot was terrible and it ruined the jedi lore...it has been reduced to magic...2 out of 5 stars is too generous","true":true}
