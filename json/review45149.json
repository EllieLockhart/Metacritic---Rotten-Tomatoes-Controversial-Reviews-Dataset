Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately this is the worst movie in the entire franchise. JJ set up a number of interesting  and exciting questions in Episode VII\\, and Johnson answered them in the most uninspired\\, and disappointing way possible\\, that makes you think he either hates Star Wars\\, doesn't understand it\\, or simply doesn't give a damn. He ruins the character of Luke Skywalker\\, and Mark Hamill is too much of a gentleman to come out and say that directly\\, but if you hear his interviews\\, he sure as hell believes it to be the case. Let's hope the Johnson trilogy never sees the light of day.","true":true}
