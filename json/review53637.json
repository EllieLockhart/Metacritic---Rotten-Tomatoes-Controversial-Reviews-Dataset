Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off it was too long. Many scenes dragged on with the same taste and flavor of many other Star Wars films. One scene in particular which I thought was really really bad was when their last remaining ship releases all the Escape ships and then it takes many of the Escape ships to be blown to bits before the captain realizes all she has to do is turn her ship around jump to lightspeed and slice the attacking ship into pieces. That scene alone should never have happened especially if she is a commander that it had to take that long to watch her friends Parish before she realized her option was to attack and sacrifice herself I thought that was quite honestly pretty pathetic but it is Star Wars and the predominant number of fans will be satisfied but myself being old school and seeing the original it's time for new chapters to be written and not depend on many of the old Star Wars standards in the battle scenes. I surely hope that things can change now that it's Carlo Ren against the girl for the future. I can and will say this I believe the MCU Infinity War film will blow Star Wars off the map dollar-wise in box office receipts at least I certainly hope so much better writing going on in the Marvel Universe than for Star Wars.","true":true}
