Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wait for video. On its own merits this film will leave you disappointed; if you paid to see it in a crowded theater it will leave you disappointed AND annoyed.\\n\\nPerformances were good\\, but the story elements can be put into two groups: Things that don't make sense for that character and things that are pointless.  I have to imagine talks of a Rian Johnson trilogy are to save face and that those movies will never happen.  At least I hope not.","true":true}
