Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A over the top action movie that seems to want to be something other then Star Wars. It spits on star wars fans and uses cheap modern humor to appease the younger crowd. Overall the worst entry in the star was saga. I would give it a pass.","true":true}
