Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If there was a way to completely ruin a beloved story and movie franchise\\, the Last Jedi succeeds in spades. That's the only way succeed and the Last Jedi could be used in the same sentence. It would have been so simple and effective to go along with what the Force Awakens and Rogue One established as the new era of StarWars. Those films regarded and set up the original films in a way that lifts the entire story and intrigues viewers to find out and want more. \\nHowever\\, the Last Jedi is full of ridiculous slapstick humor\\, plot inconsistencies\\, and a storyline that drags the hero\\, Luke\\, through the mud. The latest StarWars completely nullifies the epic and classic tale of good-vs-evil set up in the previous films by marginalizing the bad and vilifying the good causes and that's just some of the huge misses of the Last Jedi. When your kids ask\\, \\\"Why did they make Luke Skywalker a bad guy?\\\" then there has been huge mistakes made. \\nIf you're still interested in watching a Saturday Night Live-esque parody of StarWars\\, you can forgo the Last Jedi and rent Mel Brook's film\\, Space Balls. You'll have saved yourself $50 and you'll get to keep one of your favorite movie franchises from being completely ruined and have something to actually laugh at and not shake your head in disgust.","true":true}
