Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER FILLED REVIEW\\nFinally saw The Last Jedi and it's ok\\, but in no shape or form second best after TESB. \\nWhat I liked most was the character development of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren\\, very well build up as the main proponent of the dark side\\, no second Vader but he doesn't need to be\\, actually a much more complex and interesting character.\\nThe battle scenes were impressive and the movie looks and sounds beautiful.\\nThere's a few funny moments that work well\\, not the Porgs though\\, what do these anoying penguins in a star wars movie\\, they didn';t learn their lesson from Jar Jar Binks.\\nCarrie Fisher was great\\, even though the space scene was utterly ridiculous. The reunion with Luke was very well handled even though he turned out to be a bloody hologram\\, jeez.\\nI loved the reunion of Luke with Yoda\\, to me the most moving scene\\, quite magical.\\nOk\\, the gripes:\\n- Luke was badly handled and I know it's a very subjective opinion\\, but on  this topic it can't be anything else of course. I didn't want\\, what some fans seemed to be craving for\\, a reunion with Leia and Han and the old gang kicks ass one more time. That would have been stupid in my mind\\, but the way it eventually ended up being handled didn't feel right to me either.\\nOf course the movie is about Luke\/Rey (being the last Jedi) I excpected way more than the scenes they had together.\\nEven though\\, if you think back\\, Luke's training by Yoda wasn't spend that much time on either\\, but somehow impacted you more\\, because Luke leaves\\, though before completing it\\, called away by the urge to save his friends. Rey leaves\\, because she has no time left to help her friends\\, but also because she is disappointed and failed by Luke\\, Big difference.\\nAlso a gripe that keeps resurfacing\\, the parallels with the original trilogy are becoming a bit annoying and to be honest\\, come accross as a bit lazy by the writers.\\nRey has become annoying and in no way captures your heart as Luke did in the original trilogy\\, sorry\\, she has a lot of spunk\\, but memorable she the character is not. Don't know why yet\\, but I think it's the writing not the actress.\\nStill don't have a clue what Finn is good for in this story\\, baffles me how he keeps getting screentime even though the character is developing nowhere.\\nDamon Poe has replaced him as the more fun rebel.\\nDidn't like at all the send offs of two of the new villains Snoke as well as Captain Phasma\\, apart from the fact that nobody kicks Brienne of Tarth's ass\\, sorry Poe\\, they both deserved a way better ending\\, having been build up in part seven and then show them once and off they go?\\nThat;s crappy writing and no one will convince me otherwise and a shame because both had potential.\\nAnyway\\, I am very glad there was a new Star Wars and well\\, since the old garde is now gone\\, I hope they will start truly taking the reigns of the franchise storywise and actually come up with someting new and not just a badly disguised rehash of the original trilogy.","true":true}
