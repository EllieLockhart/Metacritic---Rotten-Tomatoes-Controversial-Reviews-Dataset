Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm old enough to have seen the first Star Wars in the movie theaters.  I'm bewildered at the reaction of some audience members who hate this movie.  They wanted the characters to be true to their own ideal\\, they wanted the force to be confined to some sort of Jedi religion thing\\, and\/or they had their own storyline\\, and Rian Johnson gleefully takes the story to unpredictable places.  The force is now not limited to Jedi\\, and it can do more than what we thought\\, now that non-Jedi\/Sith can use it.  A hero's journey doesn't always have to be predictable \\\"story book\\\"\\, but instead a rich story about failure\\, pain\\, and redemption.  When I read the negative reviews I see a desire to have a story that is more fairytale and predictable.  You can't please everyone\\, but for me\\, this is one of the deepest\\, surprising\\, and richest tales in the franchise; the fact that it is provoking such discussion proves its success.  I remember being so disappointed in the turns that were taken in Empire Strikes Back\\, and deciding\/hoping that Darth Vader was lying to Luke about his parentage; now that movie is considered the best in the series.  I wouldn't be surprised if The Last Jedi comes around to being considered one if the finest as well.","true":true}
