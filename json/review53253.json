Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars film created. Unimaginative\\, too reliant on humour (that did not work and becomes awkward)\\, very wishy washy. It has the clear intent of 'wiping the slate clean' in order for Disney to make endless amount of spin-offs. Force Awakens was amazing and I expected a great follow up film to answer the mysteries of Episode 7. Instead\\, the fans were given a film full of plot holes\\, pointless sub-plots\\, a waste of opportunity (Captain Phasma\\, Snoke\\, Luke Skywalker\\, Rey's parents etc. were all very very disappointing and has the chance to be much better). The ending was awful. Throughout the entire film I hoped that it would get better\\, but it didn't. It's like someone who has never seen Star Wars wrote and directed the film. Give it a watch and decide for yourself - all I can say is thank goodness that Johnson (directer and screenwriter) is reported to have nothing to do with Episode 9.","true":true}
