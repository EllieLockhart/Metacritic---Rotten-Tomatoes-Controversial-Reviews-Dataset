All you want to do is to loose. To let her win. But you can't. All you can do is to play and feel terrible and it's getting worse and worse.\rI've even don't remember when i hated negative character THAT MUCH like Abby. Yupe\\, it's still an negative character. ND shows her motives\\, but i don't care (and it sux also) - it's just an bad and ugly negative character.\rIt'll be quite ok for a standalone or a spinoff. But as for an sequel? It's not.\rDamn is so much about hate. Dear Neil\\, all i want for xmass is You. And an golf club.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
