Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of action and unexpected turns throughout the movie with characters brought back from older movies! Love the movie but was also a tiny bit confusing","true":true}
