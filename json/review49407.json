{"101487":198877,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst SW movie by far! You know it's bad when you look back and have to painfully admit that Phantom Menace was better. As many others have said\\, long time SW fans feel as though SJW Disney bought this franchise to destroy it and re-invent it to promote their SJW propaganda and shove it down our throats. This is the revenge of the \\\"socially awkward and emotionally broken\\\" who are now in positions of power and control and feel as though they're superior to all of us and need to teach us a lesson. Money and\/or consumer opinion is no longer a concern for the higher ranks of SJW America. Star Wars it's just another casualty of this soon-to-be shameful period of our history.\\n\\nAs far as Last Jedi is concern\\, the movie already starts with an awkward scene in a sad attempt to inject \\\"Marvel humor\\\" into a franchise that isn't compatible with that. An early sign that Disney has no interest or clue about the essence of what made SW a powerhouse.\\nWe have SWFA characters that don't evolve into anything new (Poe\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, etc.). Luke\\, the ultimate SW legend\\, being reduced to a caricature of a hermit that constantly paces around an island like a squirrel on caffeine and squeezes the tit of a giant female Watto to drink the green milk that comes out of it. They totally killed the bad ass that Luke was supposed to become and instead they gave us a shell of a man that is closer to a demented bum than a Jedi. The excuse to explain how this came to be is as lame as any story line in this trilogy. All the while Kathleen and Rian loved every single second of it: \\\"Screw that white man! HA HA HA!!!\\\". The only classic character that gets any sort of respect is Leia [a female]\\, so much so that they make her \\\"Superwoman\\\" in the one infamous scene for no good reason. Chewbacca\\, 3PO\\, R2 don't do much of anything\\, totally useless! (Save the R2\/Luke scene\\, was ok).\\nInteresting to note that light sabers no longer cut through everything. The bad guys came up with light saber proof material for their weapons and random parts of their uniforms. Puzzling that this happens in an era when Jedi are basically extinct\\, but hey\\, good for them for being pro-active.\\nRey is as boring as ever with her amazing powers that she just happens to have\\, she's good at everything w\/o trying\\, no explanation\\, no consequences to her actions because everything she does seems perfectly calculated. You can't criticize her too much though because you'll be labeled a woman-hater even though it has to do with character development and not gender.. (\\\"but which gender..???\\\"). Yes\\, all SWLJ female characters are strong but in no way this advances or does anything for the story other than letting YOU\\, the audience\\, know that women are strong and independent.\\nKylo Ren is about the closest to anything interesting as far as characters and he's still lame\\, weak and predictable\\, doesn't cut it as lead bad guy. Glad he got rid of that useless helmet of his though. New characters are easy to forget including del Toro's stuttering double agent (what's his name?).  SJW Disney would also like to remind you that rich people are bad and poor people are good. Oh\\, don't forget that guns are bad too because that's what makes rich people rich... and evil. This movie was written by a 12 year old and someone else took credit.\\n\\nGood special effects\\, although CGI creatures are still obvious.","true":true}
