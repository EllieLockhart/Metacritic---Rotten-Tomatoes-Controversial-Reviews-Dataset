Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely awful. The few good scenes and arcs it had were ruined by poor comedy\\, plot holes\\, bad characters\\, and lack of any real direction. Characters lack any sort of meaningful development due to Rian Johnson throwing Abram's story out the window.","true":true}
