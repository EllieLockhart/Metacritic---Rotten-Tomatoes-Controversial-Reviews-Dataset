Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, terrible movie. It is as if Rian JOhnson wanted to destroy this franchise\\, He did not stay true to the original characters or any premise in Star Wars lore. When has fuel ever been mentioned in a Star Wars movie? Yet it is the central theme of Plot A. Weird. I don't recall Han refueling the Falcon in the middle of space. Questions were set up in TFA\\, the first of the Disney owned trilogy\\, only to be thrown to the side and made a mockery of by Johnson. I have to believe they had a summary for all three films to follow\\, originally anyway. Johnson through the original plan out the window and created something far worse than even the galactic Empire!","true":true}
