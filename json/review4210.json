Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the biggest disappointment of the year.  Doesn't advance the grand plot of starwars at all.  Doesn't answer any of the big questions left from the force awakens.  Wastes a significant amount of time on sub plots that don't advance the plot of the movie.  Adds a few new special effects\\, that are totally un-necessary\\, ie Laser shots that fire on an arc and bombers that actually \\\"drop\\\" bombs in space.  If this movie didn't have te starwars tag not a single person would be giving it a positive review.","true":true}
