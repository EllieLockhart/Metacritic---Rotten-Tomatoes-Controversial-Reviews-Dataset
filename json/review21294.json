Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this wondering if they'd be able to do something new and different\\, and they absolutely did. it's got the same bleak tone as episode 5\\, but it's also so much more. definitely the deepest star wars movie to date. not everyone will get it\\, as many other reviews make clear\\, but that doesn't matter. the Last Jedi is an amazing movie and you need to see it right now.","true":true}
