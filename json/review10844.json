Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has rian johnson ever seen a star wars film? This was beautifully shot but the worst star wars film so far (including the prequels.) Every character is acting completely ooc. Rey\/finn\/poe\/rose\/leia all get completely sidelined for the least interesting character (kylo) to get some half hearted nonsense attempt at a redemption. When the first movie established that he actively chose the dark side and wouldnt be redemed. Luke isnt luke in this movie. Its so obvious that rian just adores kylo and doesnt really care about plot advancement. The end of tlj leaves the main crew in pretty much the same position they were at the end of tfa but with hundreds more deaths. There is no plot development and no setting up for the next film. Just a weird nothing movie that didnt add very much.","true":true}
