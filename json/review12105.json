Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a big Star Wars fan. I have read all of the books andof course all of the movies. I loved this movie. I would rate it as the best Star Wars movie yet. The movie brought in elements with the force that had only been explored in the books. It was emotional and exciting. I see a lot of hate from supposed fans and there is no reason for it. It was fresh but still had new elements that expansed our knowledge of Star Wars. I wish I could have seen it again right after. I kept hoping that it would not end.","true":true}
