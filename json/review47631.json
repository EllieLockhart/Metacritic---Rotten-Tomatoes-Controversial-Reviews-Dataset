Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was Rian Johnson thinking! Poorly done and not true to the original Luke's character! ?? Boo! This saddens me to see such a beloved franchise\/ saga get flushed down the drain by the way Rian haphazardly put this together. Sad day for Star wars.","true":true}
