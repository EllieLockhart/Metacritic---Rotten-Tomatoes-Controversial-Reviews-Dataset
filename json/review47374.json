Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a terrible movie. Character development doesn't make any sense. Luke & Leia serve no real purpose. Rey is the infallible Messiah of the Star Wars Universe. I've no motivation to see the third movie. Once it's completed\\, I'll only watch it if it gets added to Netflix.","true":true}
