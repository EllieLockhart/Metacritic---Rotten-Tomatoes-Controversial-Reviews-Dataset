The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The story of this game is a hard hitting one. It takes dark and horrific turns. Characters are humanised and dehumanised\\, even your enemies have names.\r\rThe Last of Us 2 is a story of how Abby went from a toxic\\, vengeful individual to somebody with purpose and a heart\\, who felt empathy for others and truly realised that every side is capable of being evil\\, or good.\r\rOn the flip side\\, it's a story of how Ellie goes from an already fairly broken person to a vengeful\\, toxic mess. It's almost like she and Abby swap places.\r\rBut I do think that Joel definitely had to die - he was going to. Ellie may have never viewed it that way (You can tell how selfish she is when she's telling him \\\"you took that from me\\\" rather than \\\"you brought me to these people\\, then murdered them all\\\")\\, but he was far from perfect\\, far from a good person\\, and it was inevitable that his past would catch up to him. By the end Ellie was worse than he was\\, by a significant margin. If you're attached to Ellie and Joel especially\\, you'll struggle with this game. If you struggle with empathy chances are you'll hate it.\r\rDina is a gem of a character and a bastion of patience\\, Lev was amazing and really lent to the development of Abby\\, who definitely had the better arc as a human being. Those environments though\\, absolutely stunning - that situational environmental design and attention to detail is unrivalled. I'd love to see a sequel from the perspective of Lev and Abby\\, I think that'd be pretty awesome.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
