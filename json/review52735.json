Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All you need to know why it wasn't that good a Star Wars movie or generally movie: \\n- https:\/\/youtu.be\/tVtaM1af6bg \\n- https:\/\/youtu.be\/B_Z_GXf-FDM \\nThe actors themselves is pretty good. But the characters they are portraying\\, is not done well (As Mark Hamill also thought about Luke when he first read the script). Pretty bad actually. Most notably; Luke\\, Leia\\, Ray and a specially Snoke. In that\\, I would also include General Hux and Captain Phasma. Hux just looked like a weak stepping stool throughout the movie. And Phasma\\, barely been in it\\, has no actual point or development in it. The same as with Snoke.\\nKylo Ren were the one character I thought were very good and true to the character. Poe Dameron and Vice Admiral Holdo I would also give a thumps up for the portraying of the characters.","true":true}
