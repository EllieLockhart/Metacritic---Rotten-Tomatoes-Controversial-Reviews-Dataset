Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is Star Wars to a \\\"T.\\\" Its the story of a group of underdog warriors trying to survive against unspeakable odds. It's the last remnants of the Jedi maintaining their sacred religion and passing it on. It's a visual spectacle on an grandiose scale. What more do you want from a Star Wars movie?","true":true}
