Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was sloppy and uninspiring. The acting was poor. General Hux was absolutely horrible. Laura Dern was horrible. Her character was weak. Purple fucking hair? Give me a break. The plot was thin. The writing was pathetic. The direction was a total travesty. The only thing that kept this movie from a complete disaster was the Rey\/Kylo Ren story line. Daisy Ridley did a tremendous job again. Carrie Fisher god bless her soul was just awful. They totally blew it with bringing skywalker back. Now he is a pussy. Fuck that\\, he should have been doing extensive training with Rey. Like like months of it. Have some flashbacks of the training and make her more powerful. Then get skywalker back in the god damn fight. He should have raised that x wing and got in a battle scene. The yoda scene was ??. Too much cheesy forced comedy. Needs to have way more drama. Maybe darker. Where the fuck did snoke come from? This movie just bounced all over the place. Luke should have been leading a fucking army against Kylo Ren to show him what's up. There is Disney all over this movie. What the fuck was Disney thinking? Did the director even watch the original movies?","true":true}
