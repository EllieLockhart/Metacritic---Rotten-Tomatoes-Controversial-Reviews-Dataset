Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very disappointing. a hole Portion of the movie dedicated to 2 characters is entirely filler. major plot holes. a villain that is never utilized were left wondering were he came from and why is he doing this with no explanation. actually this will sum of this movie for you. It's a star wars movie with no lightsaber fight. nuff said. ","true":true}
