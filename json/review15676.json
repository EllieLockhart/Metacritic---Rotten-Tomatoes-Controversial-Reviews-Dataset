Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie! At first I didn't know what to think of it and I was like 'what just happend' but I watched it twice now and absolutely love it\\, I think everyone should see it twice! Better than TFA in my opinion","true":true}
