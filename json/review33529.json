Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible even from the very start. This movie does not belong and does not resemble the star wars universe. I won't watch it again. For the normal viewer it has an appropriate amount of action pointless deaths including the offscreen death of a well cult hero character which didn't seem to make any sense. Princess leias role almost made me cry and there are a lot of inconsistencies. If you care at all about Star Wars don't offend your eyes. Oh flying space leia???????? Really?","true":true}
