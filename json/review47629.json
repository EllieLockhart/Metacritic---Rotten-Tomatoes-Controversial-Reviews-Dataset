Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was once a pure and hopeful trilogy made with the intention of making art\\, is now a heartless sellout to push a political agenda down everyone's throats. It's painful to see everything that was once loved about Star Wars being tortured before your eyes\\, this simply isn't what anyone wanted","true":true}
