Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an overrated mess. If it wasn't before\\, it's most definitely clear now that the Star Wars franchise is a one-trick pony. I won't spoil anything simply because there's nothing to spoil: all the \\\"big\\\" reveals are none too interesting\\, there are plenty of \\\"huh?\\\" moments\\, and we get more of the same ol' \\\"it's your destiny\\\" crap. SW continues to lack the courage to reach outside its well\\, but at least I know better than to buy a ticket for the next movie.","true":true}
