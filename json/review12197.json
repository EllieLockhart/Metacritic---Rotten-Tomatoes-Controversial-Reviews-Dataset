Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a very big Star Wars fan much like a lot of people on here reviewing. I am very disappointed and feel that this movie was poorly written. Money grab junk is what I got from it. I am lost for words.... some many things I want to say and I'm sure we all do but it's to late. There is nothing we can do. It's done.","true":true}
