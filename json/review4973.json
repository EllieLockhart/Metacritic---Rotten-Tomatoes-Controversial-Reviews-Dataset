Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have easily been titled Star Wars Episode 8: Gotcha because every time it approached a previous plot point\\, franchise theme or foreshadowed character arch\\, the movie subverted it and you can hear Rian Johnson's voice in the background saying\\, \\\"Gotcha!\\\" \\n\\nBut seriously\\, what's going on with the locked 49%? There is NO. WAY. there isn't something going on here\\, and it's going to bite RT's credibility in the arse if they don't address it.","true":true}
