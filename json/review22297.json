Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi has ruined \/ ended my 40 year enjoyment of George Lucas' Star Wars franchise.  I will not see another Disney SJ Wars movie.  I gave Force Awakens a chance\\, and it delivered a reasonable performance for the SW franchise.  Rogue One was a wasted 2 hours\\, the last five mins. were the only thing worth watching.  Last Jedi leaves massive plot holes and unanswered questions\\, SJW messaging ridiculously over-the-top\\, no connection whatsoever with any character.  Rebellion survives or First Order wins....it's meh\\, whatever.  Don't waste your time \/ money on this Disney money-making fiasco.","true":true}
