Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney direction of the new Star Wars trilogy is a mess. They don't seem to have a clue what story they want to tell\\, they just do it as they go which causes a lot of characters and plot points to be unresolved or resolved really poorly. There are new things that we never seem in the SW universe and I'm ok with that unless you explain it to me decently. There are a lot of plot holes and Finn's and Rose's subplot could be much more interesting and useful to their story and the general story of the movie.","true":true}
