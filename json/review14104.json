Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you take it at surface value its a good film. By all means not perfect but surely enjoyable\\, both visually and emotionally. \\n\\nThe majority of reviews are from lifelong fans who have blown their expectations out of the proportion completely. They expect the characters to stay the same and the story to be familiar; whilst at the same time asking for new legendary plot-twists that have kept Star Wars so vidid in our memories. \\nTo sum up: \\n\\nThe good: \\n-Cast both new and old cannot be faulted\\n-As per normal\\, the action and visuals are what you expect from Star Wars. Nothing less than brilliant \\n-Special mention for Adam Driver's acting. He evolves from a scared young adult to an agressive warrior \\n-Lukes arc is continued well. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n- A key point that has been brought up and for good reason is plot holes. \\n-Poes story and character ate some weaker points of the film\\n-Still unanswered questions and now even more questions \\n-The ending \\, for me fell a bit flat. Would have perrefered if luke had been sacrificed himself physically in the final battle. Instead we got him using a force power which does suspend disbelief which some takes you out of the movie experience \\n-The humour was too frequent and in places very heacy handed\\n-Finn and Rose had a poor side story","true":true}
