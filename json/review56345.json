Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, cast aside a load of plot threads from TFA\\, totally wasted the character of Luke Skywalker and the whole film centres on a nonsensical slow speed chase through space. I don't know what the critics were watching but I was massively disappointed by this.","true":true}
