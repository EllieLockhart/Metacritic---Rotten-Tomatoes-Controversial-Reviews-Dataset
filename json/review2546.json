Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well made film to a terrible script that forsaken everything that made Star Wars great. Butchered Luke\u2019s and the original films storylines in favor of political correctness agenda and uncharismatic characters. Long\\, uneven by tone\\, and overstuffed. Despite strong performance by Hamill it single handedly ruined the Star Wars saga\\, and with amount of damage it caused\\, it\u2019ll be hard to Impossible to fix in future sequels. ","true":true}
