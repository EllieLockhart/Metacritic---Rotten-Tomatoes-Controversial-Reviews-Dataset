Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do I really have to give the 1 star for RT to count my vote?  Whatever.  I have been using RT for a decade\\, but this is my first review.  I had to come out and let people know the truth about this movie.  What did you do to Luke?  Luke...my eternally optimistic hero has given up on everything.  This not the Luke you're looking for *waves fingers*.  I never thought I'd miss the prequels.  Never.","true":true}
