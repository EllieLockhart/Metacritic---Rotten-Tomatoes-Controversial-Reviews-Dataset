Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. There were bits of it that I think the movie could have done without but overall such it's a fresh and exciting take on the Star Wars universe. It doesn't just expand what we know about the Force but also the politics of the Universe.","true":true}
