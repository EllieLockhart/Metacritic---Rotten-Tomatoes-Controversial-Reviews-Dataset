Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a tone deaf mess in which none of the jokes ever landed and the characters were so stupid that I found myself constantly rooting for them to die only for them to saved by some of the dumbest\\, most laughable plot armor that I have ever seen (Finn and Rose during the exploding ship and salt planet scenes\\, I'm looking at you). Rey is bland and unbelievably good at everything she does\\, and the movie constantly spits on Luke Skywalker\\, and\\, really\\, Star Wars fans everwhere. I watched this movie on the same plane ride that I watched Daddy's Home 2\\, and this movie made it looks like a masterpiece. Oh\\, and it reeks of SJW propaganda. Like bad. Terrible movie. Don't waste your time.","true":true}
