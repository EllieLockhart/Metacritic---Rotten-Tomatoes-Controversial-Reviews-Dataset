Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m pretty sad about it. So much\\, decades worth of\\, potential and build up thrown away. I love all the Star Wars movies\\, and still watch them all repeatedly...just\\, woof. Years of anticipation for things hoped for never to be realized\u2014ugh. I don\u2019t post reviews ever but I had to say something about this one. 2.5 hours of unfulfilled hopes. The Star Wars we knew and loved is now gone. Ironically TFA represented a new hope but TLJ is certainly the empire striking back...maybe Abrams can bring about a return of what we loved for IX. - - - Saw it a second time. Liked it better the 2nd time. Middle still drags though.","true":true}
