Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has anyone noticed the conflict between men and women in \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"? I noticed that Ren and Rey are in conflict between good and evil.Poe is in conflict with the female admiral about who's in command of the Rebel ship. Finn is in conflict with Rose the techie. Luke is in conflict with Rey about who will be the teacher and who the mentor. Was the screenwriter trying to make it clear that men and woman in tense situations will be in conflict?","true":true}
