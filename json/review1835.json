Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As entertainment movie an 8\\, as a Star Wars movie just a 5 minus.\\nI didn't like the overkill on disstastefull humour and the lack of respect for the character of Luke Skywalker.\\nWhen Luke threw away the lightsabre it was already done for me!\\nThere are cool spectacular scene's in it but Star Wars? It's a big NO.\\nI'm realy pissed of about this!","true":true}
