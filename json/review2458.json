Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very lackluster movie. The Force Awakens put the fun of the old movies back into the franchise. This entry most decidedly did not. All very serious. The script obviously had major issues. Rey's adventures weren't interesting. Finn's romance and wild outing seemed very contrived. The pilot's 'mutiny' against the admiral (whose entrance seemed very forced) seemed designed to make some sort of PC point proving that Star Wars wasn't all about brave boys doing warlike things. Mark Hamill was okay\\, but not quite Alec Guinness. There was some humor\\, but overall\\, not that much. Some 'wonder' but just to little. The best scene was undoubtedly the confrontation of Rey\\, Solo and 'Snope'. But even there\\, you have to wonder just how stupid these Sith Lords are.","true":true}
