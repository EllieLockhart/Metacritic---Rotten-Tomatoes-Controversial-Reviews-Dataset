Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was able to go in without expectations. I'm not a fanatic but I did buy Friday night tix 2 months ago. Visually amazing. Fight choreography solid. Adam Driver has an amazing performance that requires him to emote vulnerability\\, longing and rage (sometimes simultaneously). I would have cut out a couple of scenes. Pleasantly surprised twice. No screw ups. Solid movie given it is a \\\"2 of 3\\\" -- no super satisfying finale.","true":true}
