Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies never mind a Starwars movie that anyone can watch. The movie has zero respect for content that relates to the characters that came before\\, for example Princess Leia now has Lesbian undertones\\, Fynn is now just pure comic relief\\, Poe is a childish testosterone filled caveman idiot\\, and Luke Skywalker is a murderous coward who abandons friends\\, family and reason only to die a pathetic death in the end to pull off a joke.\\n\\nRey\\, the main character still overcomes obstacles simply because she exist. Two movies in and all hee skills\\, abilities and knowledge exist because she does. The force made her so. This is not a good character and poor story telling at it's worst.","true":true}
