Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good moments\\, but it is a BIG departure from what Star Wars has been\\, and not in a good way. Very disappointed. That\u2019s really unfortunate\\, because other than the Death Star sized ball of disappointment I left with\\, I would have been semi entertained. Nobody owes anyone an apology\\, but someone sure as heck owes us our characters back. What a gut-punch!","true":true}
