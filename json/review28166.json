Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor direction\\, terrible dialogues\\, amateur use of humour\\, incompetent and contradictory screenwriting with enough plot holes to fill a Star Destroyer. Feels like a collection of YouTube clips stitched together by a very confused and bickering production team - none of whom have ever seen a Star Wars movie or know what it is supposed to look and feel like.","true":true}
