Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi takes its viewers on a glorious space adventure. This film in particular is extremely story and Star Wars lore heavy\\, so unless you've seen the previous films (at least 4-7)\\, and\/or are a Star Wars fan that follows the lore\\, this one may be a bit hard for you to follow. This movie is very different from its predecessors\\, while still borrowing elements from prior films. This films unexpected twists and turns will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.","true":true}
