Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't bad because it was \\\"different\\\"\\, it wasn't bad because it \\\"took risks\\\"\\, it wasn't bad because fans are \\\"too picky\\\" (see responses to Rogue One and The Force Awakens to dispel this rumor). It was bad because The Force Awakens' Hux became the oafy goofball on the other end of a prank call\\, because our beloved princess flew through space like she was Mary Poppins\\, because Poe murdered an entire squad of resistance bombers with no consequences and no remorse\\, because Holdo wasn't a traitor and Poe's treason was chalked up as \\\"cute\\\"\\, because Finn and Rose embarked on a subplot with no purpose or resolution\\, because Luke was a coward\\, because Rey was not trained\\, because Snoke is nobody\\, Rey is nobody\\, because as Han said before \\\"that's not how the force works\\\"\\, because Kylo Ren appeared to kill Luke but it was an illusion but then he just dies anyway. Remember the iconic new John Williams piece from the film? Me neither. Star Wars is over\\, the dark side has won.","true":true}
