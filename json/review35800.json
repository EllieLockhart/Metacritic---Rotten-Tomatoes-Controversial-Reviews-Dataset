Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is not as good as it should have been. It removes the old characters in the worst ways possible. While trying to seem like they are being   respectful For example\\, Han Solo has no growth.As some one who used to be a smugglers\\, he should have been something greater like a owner of something that showed his wisdom over the years. The honorable Luke Skywalker is now a parody of himself. He is a coward that put a tracer in r2d2 but now doesn't care about his once loved rebellion. And they both die as something less than what they were. And to top itoff\\, Chewbacca hasn't aged since Return of the Jedi. Wow that's insulting and thinking of these problems among other issues. I wonder how this Franchise will age. My guess is it will  step down as one that once was one of the greatest blockbuster of all time and become a shallow boring kids movie. However it might still be a blockbuster.","true":true}
