Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie so much! Great cast\\, fantastic script and the visuals were just spectacular! I really have no idea where the hatred and dislike is coming from\\, but those people are just plain wrong! Can't wait to see it again and again! This has definitely thrown a wrench into my personal ranking of the film's in which the top three have always just been the original trillogy.","true":true}
