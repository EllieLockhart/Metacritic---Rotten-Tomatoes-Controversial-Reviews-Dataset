Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a total disappintment in every single level. People in the years to come will put Star Wars int: the Lucas films\\, and the abominable Disney films. This movie is choppy\\,uneven\\, uneven\\, excruciatingly slow\\, character regress or are destroyed by terrible storyline decisions. There is a scene where Luke gets milk\\, and it is sickening. If you are watching this film to see the continuing story of the Jedi and the Skywalker line\\, you best stay home. Looking for the ultimate lightsaber duel between Luke and Kylo-you best stay home. Looking for a big reveal and more exciting developments with Snoke? Nope. Rey training with Luke as Ashe did with Yoda? Wishful thinking. Luke Skywalker coward and hermit? Now you're getting it. Luke might be in 19 minutes of the film\\, and you'll wish he wasn't in that much by the time this catastrophe plays out over a very long 2 hours and 32 minutes (which seems more like 5 hours). Slapstick comedy in spades\\, it never stops. In what should be some extremely poignant moments\\,  you instead get cornball comedy. Rian Johnson means to erase Star Wars as we know it\\, and all its grand legacy\\, and replace it with his blasphemous vision. Luke is no longer a hero\\, but a whiner\\, and a recluse. He and Yoda laugh about the destruction of a sacred Jedi treasure(s). If Johnson set out to destroy Star Wars\\, he did an outstanding job. Look for a gigantic second weekend drop as word of mouth will do some damage to this train wreck of a film. If I had a choice\\, I would not have seen this film to start with. Stay home and enjoy what you know of State Wars\\, you will not like what you find here.","true":true}
