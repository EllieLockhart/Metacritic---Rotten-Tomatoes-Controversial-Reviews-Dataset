It does come at a slight cost however as it\u2019s capped at 30 frames-per-second\\, dipping slightly below that in very rare instances. Music plays a central role not only enhancing the mood\\, but also humanizing the world and characters. If you manage to find a guitar lying around\\, Ellie can practice for a bit\\, offering a nice distraction from the unforgiving elements. Like the original\\, companions accompany you periodically on the journey. During combat they occasionally help out by dispatching enemies\\, but problems similar to the original game are still present. While partner movements aren't as awkward as before\\, they still feel artificial as they bounce around in an effort to follow your lead. When not engaged in combat however\\, they offer touching moments\\, levity\\, and insight into the world. Countless conversations range from mundane to deeply personal and further contribute to the incredible storytelling. The Last of Us Part II presents an absolutely crucial and challenging narrative about love and hate. Characters have convincing motivations that leave you thinking about more than what\u2019s in front of you. The places it takes you to are awe-inspiring to explore\\, with unrivaled attention to detail\\, and although the combat is somewhat forgiving\\, it remains thrilling throughout much of the harrowing journey. The Last of Us Part II leaves a deep\\, emotional impact\\, and this unforgettable continuation should not be missed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
