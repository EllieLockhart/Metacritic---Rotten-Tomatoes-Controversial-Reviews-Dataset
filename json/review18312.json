Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this film was an odd failure\\, put together by someone who either didn't understand what they were doing\\, or wanted to subvert expectations in a way they weren't talented enough to pull off. I wish that this film had been made completely differently. It disappointed me.","true":true}
