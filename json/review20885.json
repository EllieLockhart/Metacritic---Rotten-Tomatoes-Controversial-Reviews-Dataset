Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was blown away. I went in xpecting a remake of ESB but this was something different\\, \\\" this isn't going to go the way you think\\\". The galaxy just got a whole lot bigger. \\n\\nI laughed and cried. I was surprised over and over. Loved the twists and turns. The comic relief was fun but never overpowered the story.  The action was riveting\\, and the acting was great. Well done Mark Hamil.\\n\\nFinally I found myself sitting in the theater during the credits\\, not expecting a post credits scene\\, but because I needed time to process and wipe away a tear. Thank you to Disney\\, and the cast and crew. Well done.","true":true}
