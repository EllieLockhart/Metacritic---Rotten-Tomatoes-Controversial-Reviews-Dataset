Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it! I felt it! I really felt this film more so than any other of the SW films. The only conflict I have is were to place it on my top 9 list 1 or second. I will be going to see it twice in theaters. I left this film emotional but not sad. Glad that the evolution of the stir tidbit that all lines are not as concrete as some fans would want be blurred be unpredictable this is a perfect evaluation to force balance and at the end of the day this is a force story not a sky walker story he was tool by the force and now the force is choosing others to continue the battle that is the balance of light and dark.. peace! Almost my altime favorite movie of all time that good.","true":true}
