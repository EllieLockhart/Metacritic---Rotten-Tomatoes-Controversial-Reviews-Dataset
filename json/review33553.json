Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film. Not so much the ideas\\, but the way they were done. Some really lame storylines. I?m a lifelong dedicated Star Wars fan and I couldn?t believe what I was watching. Come back George Lucas\\, all is forgiven.","true":true}
