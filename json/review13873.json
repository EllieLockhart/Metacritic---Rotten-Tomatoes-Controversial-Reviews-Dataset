Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If upon first viewing this film feels like an elaborate\\, multi-million dollar fan fiction funded by a colossal\\, greedy corporation to milk another overworked franchise for money then it's because that's exactly what it is. And unless you're still hungry for even more flashy spectacle paired with vapid\\, muddy substance\\, a second viewing won't even be necessary.","true":true}
