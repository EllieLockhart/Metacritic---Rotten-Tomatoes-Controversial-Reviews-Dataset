Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes real world politics too far\\, and fans dont need to be divided by political rubbish\\, Star Wars brought people together it never divided them regardless of their political views. This movie has done a massive disservice to fans old and new. Kathleen Kenedy please do everyone a favor and step down clearly you cannot stay as the head of Lucas Film. Please let Star Wars be what it once was. Amazing and let people come together politics aside. Please step down immediately. And Hire capable humans.","true":true}
