Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Failure was a thematic necessity in this film\\, just like it was in Empire. Our main heroes learned that love for each other in the throes of catastrophe is all that's worth fighting for. Yoda says it\\, \\\"a most courageous teacher\\, failure is.\\\" They don't win just because they are good\\, just like Luke couldn't defeat Vader in Empire just because he was good. And that doesn't render their efforts irrelevant... through all that failure\\, they (and we) still dare to have hope in the end? That was powerful and it dared the audience to have hope in the real world that constantly beating us down.","true":true}
