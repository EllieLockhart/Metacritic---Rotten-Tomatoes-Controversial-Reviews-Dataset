Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not 100% certain as to why this is getting such good reviews with critics\\, and such terrible reviews with audience.  Is it possible that so many audience members truly had no idea what they were going to see?  This is quintessential Star Wars\\, and the newer generation is wrecking the acting of the original one.  Mark Hamill's acting in this\\, is the WORST part of the movie.  No one is giving Adam Driver enough credit\\, and YES the \\\"last jedi\\\" is going to be a god damned woman!  Why is everyone having such a hard time with this?  Rey is 10x the jedi that Luke was anyway.  I don't get it.  I really feel as though everyone forgot that this is the 8th film in a franchise.  Did you see 1-3?  Go complain over there.","true":true}
