Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can a movie this bad have a rating of 8.1? Its real-world politics and the way they deliberately disrespected the old characters to promote the new is disgusting. This movie left me feeling profoundly sad as the child in me died and realised he has no place left in the world.","true":true}
