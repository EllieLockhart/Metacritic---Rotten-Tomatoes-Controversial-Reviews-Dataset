{"101487":175236,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a negation of everything what Star Wars symbolizes and stands for. Star Wars is a story about the fall of Anakin Skywalker and his redemption initiated by his son. Luke is the one that believed that there is still good in such an evil\\, dehumanized person as Darth Vader. Seeing Luke igniting a lightsaber above sleeping Ben Solo is just out of his character. This is not \\\"false expectation\\\". This is a negation of everything what he represents. Jedi Master... heir of the Legacy of the Jedi does not behave like that and specially does not hide from the world for 30 years. This is just absurd. It's like seeing Spartans running away from a fight\\, or seeing Socrates praising democracy.","true":true}
