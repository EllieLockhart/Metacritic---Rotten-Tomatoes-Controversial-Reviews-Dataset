Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surprising that a film this long could have so many plot holes and pointless sub-stories. From weak attempts at emotional draw to outright slapstick moments\\, this movie holds no concern for the overall Star Wars story line\\, and yet offers nothing grappling in turning in a new direction. It's clear the focus was on creating campy characters and creatures to be plush dolls lining the shelves of Disney stores nationwide. If you're able to stomach the eye-rolling moments\\, you'll come out thinking \\\"What was that even about?\\\"","true":true}
