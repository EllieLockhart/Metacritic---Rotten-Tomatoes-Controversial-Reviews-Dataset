Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps my favorite Star Wars of them all. Dialogue is incredibly well done and self-deprecating and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Ushers in a whole new way of thinking about \\\"the force.\\\"  Has plenty to satisfy the die hards and usher in a new era as well.","true":true}
