Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is bullshit and full of wtf moments. Main characters are so stupid and poorly written they are able to win in every circumstances because \\\"huh they are the good guys\\\" . The heroes wins in the most stupid and improbable ways possible. If I had to resume this movie in one sentence it would be \\\"shut up it's magic\\\".","true":true}
