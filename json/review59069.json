Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have just finished The Last of Us part 2 and have to say that it is a masterpiece in terms of graphics\\, gameplay etc. which is an important part of the credibility in this world. The Last of Us 2 biggest strength is not the aesthetics or the fun in killing zombies\\, it is about the relations with the characters. The Last of Us Part 2 is about revenge and the circle of hate\\, where moral\\, death and suffering plays a major role. Hate is something what not only the protagonist will encounter\\, but also the player himself. Even though it is a game what you play\\, it never felt like it\\, the emotions what you create after a certain plot twists was for me something what I have never felt before. I questioned everything in it\\, the violence\\, the motives and the results.\r\rThe Last of Us Part 2 wants you to hate it\\, is highly controversial and that makes it so great. That's also why it has so many negative reviews\\, its not the typical hollywood movie style of telling a story\\, where the \u201ehero\u201c and the \u201eenemy\u201c is clear to see.\r\rThis game is truly unique and I recommend it\\, beware  you will not have fun \u201eplaying\u201c it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
