Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To many misses than hits. More like a Disney animated movie they tried to adapt to live actors. Anti climatic deaths along with terrible character usage. \\nActing overall was great along with most of the CGI. Just seemed like a mix of TESB and TROTJ was hoping for a more original story line rather than an almost carbon copy line for line scene for scene from the old movies. Porgs and crystal foxes not needed at all was waiting for princess leia to start busting out in a song.  Lando should of been the master hacker and luke was a joke and didn't even act like luke skywalker.  Could of incorporated old characters while still making the new characters the focal point. Don't parade characters with the main cast who do nothing for the movie and only have 5 minutes of screen time at the best\\, Phasma was a waste of screen time and her time.","true":true}
