Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 is ambitious. It's not the film you'd expect at this point from Star Wars\\, and\\, for that\\, I respect it. Rian Johnson was relentenlessy determined to tell his own story\\, one that doesn't cater to Star Wars fandom.  It lays the foundation for the future of the force and the franchise.","true":true}
