Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a fan of the Star Wars movie but not a fanatic\\, I've watched all the movies at the cinema but I don't own any toys or other memorabilia nor have I read any of the books.\\n\\nAs a standalone movie with no connection to the canon\\, entertaining but awkward and messy. (3.5 stars)\\n\\nAs a Star Wars movie I can't help but think that this is is a contrived and abrupt move away from the old movies. Too many changes in a single move\\, no real sense of ARC or continuity. Sorry Disney\\,  This aspect was not executed successfully and has left a gaping hole as a result.","true":true}
