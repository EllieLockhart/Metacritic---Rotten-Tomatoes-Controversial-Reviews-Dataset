Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointing. Lacked any understanding of physics or suspension of disbelief; had mostly pointless plots and subplots that didn't ultimately do anything to further the story but just distracted from it; a lot of forced political correctness which was too obvious not to be jarring; ignored the canon\/universe it is set in\\, which is why a lot of fans are upset; on that note\\, they totally misunderstood both what makes Star Wars great and who their audience is (perhaps in an effort to sell more merchandise). I don't think this was a half a star movie\\, however the critic reviews need to be counteracted because they are clearly compromised and dishonest.","true":true}
