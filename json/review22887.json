Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looked good yet was not and from flying Leia's and the dreadful  portrayal of Luke to the general poorly executed script and plot left me feeling why was such a train wreck given a green light","true":true}
