Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most god awful movie ever created. there are bad movies such as \\\"justice LEAGUE\\\"\\, \\\"the room\\\"\\, \\\"suicide squad\\\" and OTHERS\\, they are bad but at least you can laugh because of how cringy they are\\, but with the last jedi the only thing you get is disappointment and feeling of great franchise being murdered. 0\/10 worst movie ever!","true":true}
