Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. The acting and visual effects were great. However\\, the plot\/story was just disappointing. I felt like a majority of the questions I had from The Force Awakens were either ignored or brushed aside. Some of the plot-lines just went no where. This movie certainly wasn't awful\\, but it definitely left me feeling underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were too high.","true":true}
