Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warring: Spoilers!\\n\\nAfter all of the hype\\, the movie is absolutely disappointing. I would give it a negative score\\, if I could\\, because it actually takes away from all previous Star Wars films. It annihilates any rules of the Star Wars universe. It lacks sentient aliens\\, and has substituted them with silly racial diversity. It lacks jedi light saber duels\\, but has cheezy action in some strange casino. The atmosphere of being on another planet is entirely missing - no interesting architecture\\, no alien civilizations\\, no nothing - just staring at the ocean vista from Luke's boring hideaway. Luke is portrayed awfully; R2-D2 and C3PO have meaningless cameos. But\\, even the new characters are treated with little consideration - Ray is nobody; Damron is no longer a hero; John Boyega's character is on a red herring mission; Snoke is killed!!!\\, oh and so is Phasma; and Kylo Ren is turned into a confused character\\, with little meaningful motivation for what he does.\\n\\nPlus\\, the whole movie smells of an Exploitation film (a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends). And it has obvious product placements\\, as though it is a cheap production.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars film\\, it is total trash\\, just like the icon on Rotten Tomatoes shows.","true":true}
