Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has a lot of issues\\, but I can deal with it. I don't think this film is as bad as what most \\\"Star Wars\\\" fans said about this film. For the most part it was a decent sequel\\, but it's my least favorite film of the sequel trilogy.","true":true}
