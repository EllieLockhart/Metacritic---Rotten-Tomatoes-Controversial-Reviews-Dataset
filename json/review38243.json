Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The way Luke was portrayed in this movie was down right awful. This was not Luke Skywalker.  The story seemed like it was taken from a battle star glatictaica ep. The worlds and sets lacked any imagination. The prequels may have been awful in certain areas but at least they had imagination which this movie lacked. Every book\\, comic or cartoon that's come has been better then this movie.  Star wars died with this movie. The Originals are still there and star wars ends for me at Return of the Jedi.  I enjoyed Force Awakens but this movie killed star wars not just killed but when complete fubar. This movie has no respect for anything that came before not the movies not the fans not even for good storytelling nothing what so ever. but hey Disney made a ton of money that's all that matters right? Not stories not imagination not fan service not respect for source material just the bottom line.","true":true}
