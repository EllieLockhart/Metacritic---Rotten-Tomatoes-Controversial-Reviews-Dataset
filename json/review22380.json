Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lazy story telling with a ludicrous plot. The movie is all style and no substance. Mr. Disney -who buys Star Wars toys? Who buys Star Wars Halloween costumes for his boys every year? Who buys Star Wars activity books to teach his children how to count and develop a love of read. I do\\, but not anymore. You've betrayed and insulted your most loyal fans. You knew exactly what you were doing.","true":true}
