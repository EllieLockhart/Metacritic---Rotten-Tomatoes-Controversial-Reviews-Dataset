Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can\u2019t believe all the people who consider themselves Star Wars purists completely dismissing this film. This so blows away Phantom Menace\\, Attack of the Clones\\, Revenge of the Sith... And yes... EVEN RETURN OF THE JEDI. Return of the Jedi was so cheesy and campy. And the Ewoks??? Hated those stupid teddy bears. The Last Jedi Rocks. I wish we had seen it all in this order... Rogue One... A New Hope... Empire Strikes Back... The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi. These Five are the best. Last Jedi was good story telling and good fun!","true":true}
