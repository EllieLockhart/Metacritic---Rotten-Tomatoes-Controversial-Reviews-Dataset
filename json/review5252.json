Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deeply disappointing\\, all flash\\, no class.\\n\\nNo good storyline\\, an overabundance of sitcom humour\\, Rey has some kind of Superman ability where she is awesome without ever having to earn it.\\n\\nWill not be rewatching.","true":true}
