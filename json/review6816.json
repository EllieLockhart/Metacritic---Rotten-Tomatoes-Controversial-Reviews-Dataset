Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't understand why so many don't like this film. Plenty of action and the story holds up the Star Wars tradition with new heroes and bad guys. There were a couple hokie scenes but overall great movie.","true":true}
