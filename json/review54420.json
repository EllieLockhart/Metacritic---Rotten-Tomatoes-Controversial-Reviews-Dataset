Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked Ep VII\\, it had its flaws\\, but it got me very excited about the future of Star Wars. That last scene with Luke and Rey...oh my gosh\\, Luke is finally here and it's going to be so awesome to see how powerful he has become since the original trilogy\\, right? NOPE\\, Ep VIII has completely undone ALL the hope I had for Star Wars. I'm so disgusted with how disney and rian johnson dragged the original trilogy story and character development through the mud. I actually signed into rottentomatoes for the first time just to leave this review. No other movie that I've seen in my life has disappointed me so much that I couldn't just let it go. Decades of Star Wars lore now tainted. For what? Cause disney just cares about finding ways to make new money with Star Wars. They figure\\, just throw the old fans a bone and some scraps here and there\\, and they'll take it and keep buying. Well not this guy\\, I'm out now disney. You didn't have to do it this way disney\\, you could have propped up the new characters at the same you gave the original characters the proper service us old fans wanted. I'm just covering what I hated the most\\, I'm not even getting into the many other things ruined just from Ep VII to Ep VIII. I'll never pay for another rian johnson movie.","true":true}
