Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film made me lose all the faith in star wars that episode 7 had renewed. This movie was more like a boring filler episode from a cheesy Sci-fy TV series than an actual movie. This is the absolute laziest example of writing available today. From having such a rich story line left from The Force Awakens it abundantly clear the zero effort that was made in order to make an entertaining film. \\\"Oh man coming up with something deep and profound for Luke to say to Rei is hard\\, I might have to do some research.. or I could just have Luke toss it over his shoulder and go out drinking with my buddies.\\\" That kind of thinking and attitude can be applied to all aspects of this movie. Who is Snoke? Easy just kill him. Kinghts of Ren? Knights of who lol. Who is Rei? Nobody. What is Luke's role in the new trilogy? Be at fault for Kylo Ren turning dark side and refuse to do anything  and die from creating a distraction that he doesn't even tell the people he is saving about.","true":true}
