Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You have a lot of reviews to read. Some of them will be great. I'll just add one non-spoilery thing:\\n\\nI *liked* how they handled Leia and Carrie Fisher. From the first camera shot to the shot that a lot of people will complain about to the final closing credits\\, they showed her grace and how much she brought to this universe. As an homage\\, it's perfectly on point and beautifully executed.\\n\\nMy biggest beef with the movie: the humor frequently falls flat often by having bad timing.","true":true}
