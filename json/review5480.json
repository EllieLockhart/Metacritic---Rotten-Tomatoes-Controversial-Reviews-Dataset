Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed everything that TFA set up. Destroyed classic mythos of star wars characters with SJW propaganda. Wanted to love it\\, but just saddened instead. Left TFA awakened excited about the next chapter. Left TLJ not caring what happens in the future.","true":true}
