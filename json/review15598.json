Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved The Last Jedi! *thumbs up to Rian*!\\nBefore TLJ I was a casual fan of the SW franchise\\, after TLJ my presence in the cinema for IX is an absolute given. Perhaps my opinion as a previously casual fan is not as valid or justified as older more invested fans\\, but from where I was sitting\\, characters failure\\, arch's and motivations ROCKED. Perhaps FRESH\\, nuanced and complex characters are just not some peoples cuppa? ... Can't wait for more! ;)","true":true}
