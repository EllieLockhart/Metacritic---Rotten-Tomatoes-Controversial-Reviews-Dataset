Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning!  Like the best Star Wars movies\\, The Last Jedi is so visually dense\\, that you can watch it multiple times and it only gets more rewarding.  Impeccably acted!  All the new characters are very charismatic and there is a lot of good humor.  The Last Jedi also hits some really strong emotional crescendos.  Having been a Star Wars fan for 40 years\\, I believe Episode VIII ranks up there with Episodes IV and V for me in terms of best episodes.","true":true}
