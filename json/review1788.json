Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars movie\\, it is just ok.  I find the storyline between Kylo and Rey intriguing\\, and the only redeeming quality of the film.  The chase of the rebels across the Galaxy was truly a waste and took up way too much of the film.  Disposing of Snoke was a mistake\\, especially without tying him in better to the overall plot.  I can understand why Luke turned out the way he did\\, with the amount of pressure on him being the saving grace of the Galaxy\\, but I don't think hiding on an island would have been his choice.  Better to have him waiting there for Rey to come\\, as if some vision told him it were to happen\\, or better yet\\, she was his daughter.\\n\\nBetter to have left the old characters completely out of these movies\\, or to have have them short cameos.","true":true}
