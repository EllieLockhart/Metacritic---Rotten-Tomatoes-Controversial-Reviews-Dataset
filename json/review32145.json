Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: the Last Jedi honors the legacy of the trilogy while adds new and exciting characters with in-depth emotional connections. In some cases the script falls short BUT the overall movie was well done and the acting was impeccable. \\nWOW!","true":true}
