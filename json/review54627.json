Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In case anyone needs to see it\\, here are my rankings of all time best star wars films:\\n\\n\\n\t1. Rogue One\\n\t2. Empire Strikes Back\\n\t3. A New Hope\\n\t4. Return of the Jedi\\n\t5. Star Wars Rebels\\n\t6. Last Jedi\\n\t7. Force Awakens\\n\t8. Revenue of the Sith\\n\t9. Attack of the Clones\\n\t10. Phantom Menace (could be lower if possible)\\n\\n\\nI thought Force Awakens was terrible.  I thought the plot lacked originality (obviously) and lacked any connection to ROTJ.  It was basically a new story in a new timeline\\, with some cameos from old characters.  The fact that it introduced some many loose threads wouldn't have been so bad\\, had those loose threads only led forward in time\\, but many of them led backwards.\\n\\nNow\\, Last Jedi\\, was actually an OK film in its own right.  It had some elements of originality and fit a little better into the continuity\\, but for every thread of plot that was tied off\\, it created like 10 more.  And when it tied off a thread\\, it did it with bubble gum instead of a proper stitch. If you're going to provide answers\\, provide some decent ones especially when the original question was so profound.  Who was snoke? (Answer: Who gives a F---.  Who is Rey's parents? Nobody.  Come on\\, that's horeshit.  That's weak storytelling (I know I contradict myself).\\n\\nI don't think Disney killed star wars.  It think Disney is doing so much better than Lucas did with the prequels.  And besides\\, some of the best Star Wars in recent years has been Rogue One and Star Wars Rebels.  So\\, I don't know why Abrams\/Johnson screwed the pooch so badly\\, but I have hope for better things to come (and worse too\\, that's the expectation).","true":true}
