{"101487":151018,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-26","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of plot holes\\, poor character writing\\, lore breaking stunts all around\\, no respect for Chekov's Gun\\, needs to show and not tell\\, and a chase scene that involves running out of fuel... in space... a vacuum where momentum doesn't slow down... I know Star Wars doesn't always follow IRL laws of physics\\, but that one ruins the suspense of disbelief. Overall\\, I don't recommend The Last Mary Sue.","true":true}
