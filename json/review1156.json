Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anything Disney torches they destroy - \\nPolitically correct Pro women anti men - diversity - poor upbringing for all kids and they are super special - 8 year old kids can save the universe - poor script - merchandise push on kids - \\nLastly the rich are to blame for selling weapons to both sides - they are the true villain - sound familiar -\\noh lastly Rose -= new Jar Jar binks -","true":true}
