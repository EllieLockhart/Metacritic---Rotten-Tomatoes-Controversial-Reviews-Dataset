Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically \\\"Space Balls 2\\\"\\, rightfully making fun of the previous movie\\, ep 7. The way it destroys everything that the previous \\\"film\\\" has established\\, warms my heart\\, as there was nothing to be sad about. Technically\\, it does to Ep 7 exactly what Ep 7 did to SW franchise. But as a movie it's as much a failure as its predecessor\\, on every level.","true":true}
