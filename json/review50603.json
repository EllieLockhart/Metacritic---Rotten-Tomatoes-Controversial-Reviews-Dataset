Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3 o 4 cosas que no me gustaron del todo\\, sin embargo hay que entender que se trata de una historia ya muy explorada\\, por tanto\\, lograr ese desprendimiento de lo viejo y generar nuevas tramas es complejo.  Excelente y emotiva pel\u00edcula.","true":false}
