Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"UPDATED REVIEW***  I can see why people are mixed. Immediately coming out of the movie theater\\, I was entertained. This movie had so many epic stand-alone moments that made it worthwhile. The visuals were great and if you are merely a casual fan that just wants to be entertained for a few hours and doesn't really care about the underlying story\\, then\\, by all means\\, enjoy the action sci-fi movie. However\\, as a Star Wars fan\\, I don't feel this movie should be judged in isolation. It is only an individual part of a whole and if it ruins the whole\\, then it not a very good movie.  And this movie RUINS the franchise mainly because of the effect it has on the lore and its disregard for all the setup in The Force Awakens (TFA).\\n\\nThe effect it has on the star wars lore is HORRIBLE!  This movie makes horrible decisions regarding the story that has already been established and the story going forward.  It cuts off so many potential story arcs that fans were looking to explore and ruins existing story arcs and has its characters make decisions that make no sense.\\n\\nAll the main questions that we wanted to be answered in TFA were quashed:  Rey's parentage\\, Snoke's background\\, Luke and Kylo's relationship\\, etc. There were so many characters that were introduced in TFA that still needed to be fleshed out\\, but instead of fleshing them out\\, their stories were ruined and\/or cut short. In addition\\, this film seemed to also go out of its way to make sure that these horrible character story choices were final and couldn't easily be fixed. This film went out of its way to close so many doors for no apparent reason\\, it's ridiculous.\\n\\nIt's almost as if Rian Johnson completely disagreed with the direction that JJ Abrams was taking the franchise and decided to completely disregard it. But this is incredibly disrespectful to the franchise and the fans that were looking forward to learning more about these story arcs that were being set up in TFA. He should have tried to improve upon them rather than set them aside.  Continuing storylines between films only work if there is some internal consistency\\, but this film took so many sharp turns that it made the previous film pointless in many key respects.  I am disappointed in the arbitrary decisions to cut off so many promising story branches that could have been explored.","true":true}
