Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now that the saga is complete\\, TLJ is clearly the worst movie in the trilogy.  It suffers from a devotion not to fan-service; but intentional fan disservice.  The abandoning of relationships and continuity elements from the first movie; plus blatant character assassination and negligence around real world events' effect on the films (Carrie Fisher's passing) make this movie feel like a hole in the series.  It feels like a side story and not a main plot aspect of the trilogy.","true":true}
