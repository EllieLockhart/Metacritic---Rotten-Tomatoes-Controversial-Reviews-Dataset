{"101487":149715,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me preface my review by saying this; I loved this film to bits\\, and after leaving the theater for the first time I found very little to criticize. So when I saw the 55% of audience liked this film I was deeply shocked. That was until I read the audience reviews\\, and thats when I realized half the people wouldn't know a good movie\\, or a good star wars movie if it hit them in the face. If you want to see my thoughts on the movie that'll be further down\\, but I wanted to highlight some of the idiocy on display from my fellow movie viewers; and pick apart some of their criticisms with the film.\\n\\nDom P who gave it 1\/2 stars 'How is it possible to decimate the greatest franchise in movie history' the prequels 'the plot sucks' you can\\, just call this statement personal opinion; or  you could say that Dom P is wrong and that it was a good plot\\, that explored deeper themes than any other star wars\\, such as accepting the past and the actual balance between light and dark within the world and individuals. \\\"the character development was non-existent\\\" what? Dom P did you watch the same film? Kylo Ren struggles to fully embrace the dark\\, having his fathers memory haunt him\\, and slowly becoming more than just a shadow of darth vadar instead becoming a Villian worth fearing on his own.  Luke sky walker coming to terms with his failure and confronting Kylo\\, Luke who until now has been portrayed as godlike\\, and a paragon of good.  like holy crap how did Dom P miss all this character development\\n\\nD W who gave it 2 stars really struggles with basic comprehension it seems. His review is quite long (kinda like my review) but the gist is\\, D W  can't suspend his disbelief in this science-fiction film and then goes on to list \\\"errors\\\" that the film makes; most of these error he points out can be explained using basic logic\\, and I implore you to read his review and just think. For example 'Why don't the bad guys just send a few star destroyers ahead and back at light speed' Space is big\\, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that maybe\\, light speed travel in star wars is real fast\\, so that the ships can get across that big ol' space and the star destroyers would probably over shoot the 'good guys'.  D W also doesn't understand the difference between distress signals and calling somebody. D W also has apparently never seen a star wars movie because he's surprised anytime anyone survives anything\\, I could go on and on about how his nit-picking is unjust\\, and even if it was justified; who cares\\, but you can read the review yourself. He also apparently missed one of the big themes of the film by complaining that 'luke was acting out of character' when the whole point was \\\"yes Luke is out of character\\, maybe he isn't as perfect as we all though\\\"\\n\\nJoey L who gives it 1\/2 stars can be used a good seaway into a point I wanted to make\\, which is that it seems people have been randomly claiming the movie had \\\"plot hole\\\"; joey here critics the film for having 'so many huge plot holes' yet Joey and many other never elaborate on what the plot holes are\\, so I'm assuming that plot hole has now devolved into butchered buzzword which basically means \\\"Duuuh I didn't get the plot so it must be bad\\\"\\n\\nBahadir Y jumping onto the last Jedi hate band wagon before even seeing the movie 'this is not star wars' I'd make a joke like \\\"oops he must've walked into the wrong movie theater\\\" but he literally hasn't even seen the movie so.\\n\\nChris R with 1 and 1\/2 stars \\\"Left many plot points undone. Didn't expand on Snoke or Rey's parents.\\\" It did explains Rey's parents\\, they where nobodies; which might not have exactly what people had thought in their fan canons\\, but they did explain it. And they did not need to explain Snoke\\, they never explained the past of the emperor (talking original trilogy wise) so personally don't see why we need an explanation for snoke\\, especially because he is a plot devise for Kylo Ren who is differentiating himself from darth vadar by not being subservient to a master\\n\\nJJ H with 1\/2 star has got another mind numbing review; but this part in particular I wanted to focus on \\\"What are the knights of ren?\\\" You see JJ H\\, I can understand why you'd get confused because\\, luke didn't jump on his Soap box and yell  'the knights of ren are the students that Kylo Ren didn't kill at my Jedi Temple and they aren't in this movie because they'll be in the next' Instead it was subtly implied\\, so I can see why JJ H and 1000 of other people got confused\\n\\nI realize at this point that this was more of a review of the review than the actual movie; and the reason I wanted to do this is that the reception this film got really disheartened me\\, this film was bold and is was a divergence from the simple \\\"Bad guys blow up good guys and then good guys blow up bad guy\\\" and the film focused heavily on character growth opposed to two dimensional characters e.g Luke being a infallible good guy\\, the bad Villain serving the bigger Villain\\, Yet\\, despite the mastery of the film fans simply did not enjoy the film And people seemed to only not enjoy it because of either mythical plot holes or character not acting how they wanted them to act. \\n\\nTL;DR: Kylo Ren kill his Dad Han solo\\, the movie was good people just like to complain","true":true}
