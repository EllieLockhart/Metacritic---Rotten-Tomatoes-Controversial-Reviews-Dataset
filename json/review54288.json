Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"one good actor doesn't make a good movie\\, poorly written\\,no well known or interesting characters. Half hearted effort just to cash in some more on the franchise","true":true}
