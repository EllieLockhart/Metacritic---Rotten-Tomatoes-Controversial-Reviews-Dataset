Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A friend told me that Mark Hamill wrote somewhere that \\\"it's not Star Wars\\\".  After seeing the movie I get it and I totally agree with him. Silly jokes everywhere\\, weak script\\, good characters wasted\\, cute and annoying pets...the list is endless. Plus\\, the only one that got me has died. Ok\\, Admiral Holdo death was amazing\\, but she could be used on other parts. That's it. I'm disappointed.","true":true}
