Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the cgi\\, visuals\\, and theme music was great\\, it was mostly star wars fluff. It was def dragged out at the end and the whole thing was rather predictable. I really didn't care much for any of the flat one-dimensional characters. Better than the last one that was just a carbon copy\\, overall could take it or leave it.","true":true}
