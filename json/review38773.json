Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They could have done so much more\\, cause the storyline was thin\\, but in spite of that it was a good movie\\, in fact a real Star Wars movie. I have seen them all so many times since my first visit to the cinema 1977 and this is not the worst. I had a wonderful time and I am going to see it once more in 3D. May the force be with you\\, always","true":true}
