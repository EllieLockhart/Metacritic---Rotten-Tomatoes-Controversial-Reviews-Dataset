Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. Uninteresting  characters. Even Mark Hamill disagrees with what JJ did with Luke. Bad jokes\\, plot holes\\, and wasted time promoting propaganda. You really shouldn't see this movie. I know I am not gonna seer the next one.","true":true}
