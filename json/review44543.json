Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total betrayal of Star Wars fans\\, it's obvious that the directors kept things from Mark Hamill. Mark was right\\, Luke  isn't supposed to be whiny and hopeless\\, Jedi are optimistic and diligent. \\n\\nIt was a great movie with a terrible\\, TERRIBLE story.","true":true}
