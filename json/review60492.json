The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"An absolutely beautiful\\, sad\\, thought provoking and riveting game.It\u2019s daring\\, unafraid of eschewing a safe narrative that would\u2019ve cashed in on the emotional heft of the first game. The game made me consider that the idea of good\/bad\\, right\/wrong is often simply a product of perspective. It also looked at revenge and its ultimate futility and inability to fulfill or set right. The game is also about mercy\\, small or as large as they may be.I loved the new characters introduced\\, and enjoyed that the new playable character Abby had a different set of skills and strengths than Ellie. Playing Ellie as a ninja\\, relying on stealth to then play as Abby and not be afraid to get into a heads up fight was really interesting.Overall\\, the gameplay felt so good\\, and almost like what I would\u2019ve wanted out of a more focused and story driven MGS5. I also liked the flirtation with some open world elements and could\u2019ve even went for more of it\\, but this is a Naughtydog story based affair\\, so the linearity made sense.This game just worked for me on every level\\, and exceeded my expectations. I\u2019m very glad I avoided the leaks and went in only peripherally aware that a controversy existed.The pacing at times felt slightly off\\, probably my biggest gripe. And some moments were downright painful or punishing but to me the game\u2019s ability to make me go to those places was satisfying to me. It may not be for everyone\\, but it was definitely for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
