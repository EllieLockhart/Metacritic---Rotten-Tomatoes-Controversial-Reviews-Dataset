Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A big let down.  No explanation for Snoke who put up the weakest fight of any Dark Lord in the series.  No explanation for Rey.  Luke was great.  No excitement for ep9 because Ren isn't really a villain and with this  let down I'm not expected anything unexpected to happen.  I think this movie is trending towards the lowest fan rating of the series\\, no wonder.","true":true}
