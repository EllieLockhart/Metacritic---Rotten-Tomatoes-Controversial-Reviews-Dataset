Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointing take on the Skywalker story\\, Leaves many fans betrayed as Disney tries to eradicate all that was good from the original trilogy. Wish I could get my 2 1\/2 Hours back.","true":true}
