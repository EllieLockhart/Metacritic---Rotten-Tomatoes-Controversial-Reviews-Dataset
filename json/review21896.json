Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just plain awful in regards of every metric except visuals.\\nStory from 7 is not really continued and everything that happens just seems dumbed down and meaningless. I mean a Star Wars fan will watch out of curiosity but I figure you can't make too many of this kind of movies without ruining everything we now about Star wars","true":true}
