Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, awful\\, awful! Actually makes TFA a decent movie!  It also has the uncanny ability to actually make the 1977-83 movies less interesting!  I normally do not  \\\"review\\\" movies on websites but I had to get this off my chest.  This is the first Star Wars movie I did not see twice!   Where does one go for the next movie?!  So the new big bad guy is Kylo Ren!?  Does anyone care about the next movie!?  This movie seemed like a culmination not a 2nd movie of a trilogy!  All of these new characters suck and are unlikable!  Rose!?  WTF!?","true":true}
