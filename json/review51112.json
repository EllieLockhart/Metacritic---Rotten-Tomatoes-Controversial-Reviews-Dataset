Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely garbage. This movie is proof positive why its director should be stripped of the trilogy  he has been offered. Poorly written and unable to continue a single thread from the previous movies in any meaningful way. Save your money and don't see this.","true":true}
