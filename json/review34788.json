Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Director of this movie must have not watched the previous movie. The writers of this garbage never watched a Star Wars movie or at least never cared about continuity. I left this movie shocked. I went to see The Force Awakens three times in the theater but once is enough of this hot mess. I wonder if J.J Abrams stole Rian Johnson's girlfriend and this movie is the only way to get back at him.","true":true}
