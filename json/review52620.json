Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All i can say is that im very disappointed as a long time star wars fan. People will love this movie just because of the name Star Wars. But as a fan of star wars I expected much for the amount of hype that was shown.","true":true}
