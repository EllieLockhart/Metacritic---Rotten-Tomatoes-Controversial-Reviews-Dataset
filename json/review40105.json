Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars movie. Disney is eager to keep making money off star wars so they wanna get rid of all the \\\"complicated\\\" stuff that makes Star Wars\\, Star Wars. JJ set up so much stuff that we were eager to find out and then Rian\\, thought he was clever and messed with all the fans expectations. They have a right to do what they did\\, but I don't have to like it. Apparently 50% of the people agree. Regardless of the money made from fans expecting something better\\, I hope the 50% score from the audience sends a message to Disney. Truly disappointed.","true":true}
