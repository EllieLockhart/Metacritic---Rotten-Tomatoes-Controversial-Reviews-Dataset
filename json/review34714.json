Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics who are giving this movie high marks were paid by Disney. Any other Star Wars fan fiction writer could have done as well as Rian Johnson\\, who evidently doesn't know why astronauts wear those big clumsy suits in space. Midway through the film Rey & Luke are still squabbling on the island while the Finn & Fangirl are riding llamas and trying to destroy the Empire's flux capacitor. The only positive is the Snoke double-cross\\, which was a refreshing twist. Still\\, this movie is proof that the people who knew better had no power and the people with power wrongly thought they knew better. Oh\\, and the bad guy ships can travel at light speed but are stuck in place after that because.....Rian Johnson.","true":true}
