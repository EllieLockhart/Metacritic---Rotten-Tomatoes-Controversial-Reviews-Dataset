Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The line Han says in episode 7 \\\"that's not how the force works\\\" can be applied to 7-10 scenes in this movie. I understand Rian Johnson wanted to take risks but there is a difference between taking risks and completely throwing away what made this Franchise what it is. Instead of continuing on what Star Wars was before\\, they're simply going for the next dollar regardless of what is done with the story. But also making sure they push their clearly left wing political agenda as much as possible. I'm all for women and men being equal\\, but that doesn't mean make the male villain and the male heroes so helpless. This movie deserves the awful audience reviews it's getting","true":true}
