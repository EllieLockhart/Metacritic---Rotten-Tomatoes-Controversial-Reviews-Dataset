Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. I hate to say that\\, I had such high hopes for this movie after 7 and Rouge One. However\\, they dropped the ball and destroyed a trilogy that had wonderful potential. They made every male character in the movie impulsive and weak. That is a major downfall since the biggest audience for this movie is men.\\nAll that aside it did have a few moments that were solid\\, but either they played no roll in the story line or very minimal. \\nThere was absolutely no character progression from 7 to 8\\, which I was looking forward to. Kylo is still a giant brat and Rey can use the force even though she was barley trained.","true":true}
