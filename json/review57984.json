Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do i start....\\nRyan Jonhson show some promisse with all the released trailers\\, but that trailers hide a very dark secret in this movie...\\nSome incredible dumb decisions are made by the director that \\\"kill\\\" allmost all the mistery and questions of the previous movie...\\nThings like\\, who is Snoke\\, why is there\\, what is his story\\, his powers\\, etc...\\nAlso.. Rey parents and his legacy... this are treated like CRAP and thrown out of the window... \\nThen there is the LEIA scence... They should not have \\\"Resurected\\\" it... It was a proper goodbye and ppl whould understand... What they made was just stupid to say the least...\\n\\nThen we have the Side Quest in the Casino... Very boring and unecessary... DID NOTHING to the story...\\n\\nFinally Luke... OMG... Ryan portraid Luke like a psycho! A guy that would murder a children and his own blood!! WTF???\\nAlso\\, he was portraid like a Pussy and even died like one...\\n\\nHow come that was possible? Luke was one of the stong points of this new trilogy... Snoke the same... And they are discarted like trash... \\n\\nIt was like\\, Ryan see what JJ did on \\\"The force awakens\\\" and just trow everthing away for HIS vision to take place...\\n\\nI give this score\\, just because SFX was great\\, cinematografy was awsome and the Space\/Force Battles  where very well done...\\nThe story is dull\\, boring and right down silly.\\n\\nFor a long time StarWars fan was a very strong blow to the LORE...\\nLike Ryan didn\u00b4t give a shit about the  LORE of the SW universe...\\n\\nLuke was right... Nothing went the way it should... It went WAY WAY WORSE...","true":true}
