Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible at best\\, dog turd at worst.  \\n\\nSo in the past 2 movies we lost Han\\, Luke\\, Leia (IRL) and Snoke.  All we're left with for the next episode are the underdeveloped Finn\\, Po\\, Rey and Kylo - not to mention the annyoing newcomer\\, Rose.\\n\\nHow are we supposed to care what happens in the next episode?  Anyone we loved or had any intrigue to them are gone and we're left with some pretty weak characters.  \\n\\nMaybe they can bring Lando back.  Nah\\, they'll just kill him in a very lame way too.","true":true}
