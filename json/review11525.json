Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible! One of the worst written movies I've have ever seen. It was like the writer (Rian Johnson) never seen star wars but was told about it. The movie didn't tie into the last star wars. Super cheesy lines all through the movie. Just very very dissapointing!","true":true}
