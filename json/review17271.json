Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like it\\, but after having downed my huge soda and holding off on going to the bathroom because I didn\u2019t want to miss anything important\\, I realized\\, \u201cI\u2019m not going to miss anything\\, I don\u2019t even like this movie.\u201d So I left\\, did what I needed to\\, and came back to the slow space chase feeling much better\\, but still disinterested in the movie.
