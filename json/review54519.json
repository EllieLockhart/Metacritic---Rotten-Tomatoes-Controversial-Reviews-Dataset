Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a big SW fan since youth\\, but does not consider myself a hardcore fan. I don't do movie reviews\\, ever. Only this once I feel like I have to. \\nI liked Ep VII a lot\\, and was excited to see where they would bring us next. I have to say\\, yes the movie (VIII) was beautiful\\, but omg did the script leak like Titanic on April 15...\\nThe story is BS\\, and it is a complete disrespect to the original sixology. Changing key characters and universal features. Dropping exciting plot lines as if they never existed\\, giving nothing in return. The humour is lame and almost makes me beg for JarJar to step in and save the day (I said almost). It's just poorly made. It is supposed to be made by a star Wars fan\\, but Rian Johnson doesn't seem to have seen the original movies at all\\, or he is too thick to get it. It's either that or this is sabotage. Perhaps he never really liked the Star Wars universe to begin with and got the chance to torpedo it where it hurts. That's how VIII feels.\\nIts a sad thing. Go home Rian. Disney re-do. \\nMark Hamill\\,  all the things you are unable to say\\,  due to a gigantic Mickey-Mouse-gag\\, we feel it and we stand with you! A Jedi never gives up\\, and neither shall we!","true":true}
