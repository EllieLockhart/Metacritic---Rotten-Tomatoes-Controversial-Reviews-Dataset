Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. It wastes a ton of time telling circumstances that doesn\u00b4t even make a difference in the story\\, all that time wasted to make most characters look useless\\, what was that for? Really bugs me that the director was commissioned to make 3 more movies\\, Really Disney? It is barely tolerable that you accepted this director to fuck up Star War once\\, but 4 times? Common\\, you can make it better.","true":true}
