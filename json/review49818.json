Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes its a well made movie but they completely destroyed whatever was left of Star Wars.  \\n\\nStar Wars is based on Cambells HEROES JOURNEY  Not Rian Johnsons WHINY LITTLE PUNKS JOURNEY.  Not he LAME HERMIT THAT NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED UPSIDE THE HEAD JOURNEY.   It seems like George Lucas completely lost sight of it and Disney woudn'y know what to do with it if it bit them in the behind.","true":true}
