Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie tries too hard to be humorous like the new MCU movies\\, which is not needed or required\\, and completely out of place in the movie. These movies are essentially sci-fi war movies\\, constant humor and War movies is never seen. Also not a fan of Fin and Rose side adventure\\, seems like they are forcing characters into the new storyline. Fin now seems extremely out of place in the story with Rey and Kylo. ","true":true}
