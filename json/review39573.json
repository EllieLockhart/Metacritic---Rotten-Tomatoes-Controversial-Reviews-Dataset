Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was so bad I was ashamed to tell people that I was a Star Wars fan. Rian Johnson absolutely ruined the last trilogy with this pathetic attempt of a movie movie. Disney has all the money in the world to make the final trilogy of Star Wars and THIS is what they come up with ??!. I won't be paying to see episode 9.","true":true}
