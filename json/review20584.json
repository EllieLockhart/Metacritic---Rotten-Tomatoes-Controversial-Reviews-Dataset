Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never openly laughed in the theater at a Star Wars movie before. Many scenes were ridiculous\\, while others felt boring. It had by far the best Star Wars visuals and the worse plot. The director's vision for Luke was by far the most disappointing aspect of this movie. The dramatic cliffhanger of The Force Awakens is botched by unneeded humor right from the start. Such an anticipated movie is ruined by scenes as such over and over again. I was so bored during Finn and Rose's story line\\, which also came off as unnecessary and uninteresting. Overall\\, I was highly let down by The Last Jedi. You could say that I let the hype raise my expectations\\, but the director's goal to seemingly ruin everything that The Force Awakens started can not be understated.","true":true}
