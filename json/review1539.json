Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long fan this movie really fails.  It seems that many people agree.  Why would you create a sw film that alienates core fans?  Makes no sense.  Does not respect the world and rules of the original.  Also\\, the growth of the characters from the original trilogy is again cast aside in the case of Luke.  They try to be creative and surprise us with plot twists but they mostly hurt rather than help the plot.  Also\\, the overt political elements feel forced and are distracting.  There were also several word choices and one scene where it felt too much like 2017 or something you could visit in our world.  It yanks you out of the SW world.  Also\\, the heavy handed political statements were out of place and don't resonate.  This has never happened before but I will probably not watch the next one.","true":true}
