Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In years to come it will become clear this film was a complete Troll on the old original Star Wars fans.\\nRyan Johnson is a complete arrogant director and has ruined Star Wars I will not go to see the next one.","true":true}
