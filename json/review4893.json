Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cool CGI and fight scenes\\, rogue squadronish. What Rian did to Luke is a travesty and has destroyed my faith on the direction of the film. Rey is a Mary Sue\\, completely unbelievable but this was the same as Force Awakens. Characters all lack depth\\, in the attempt to discard the old in the favor of the new\\, it's only Star Wars superficially.","true":true}
