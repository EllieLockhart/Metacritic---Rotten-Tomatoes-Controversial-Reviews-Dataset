Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely one of the best Star Wars films of all time. I am a die hard Star Wars fan and I loved this film. I have not felt so excited after watching a Star Wars film since I was a child and watched the original trilogy. Don't listen to these other rotten and critical reviews. This movie is beautifully written\\, directed\\, and shot.","true":true}
