Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are going to HATE me. But I thought this was a master piece. Kinda brought that sad destruction feel that we get from so many other movies that the Star Wars saga lacks a lot. Had so much action and beautiful scenes. Rey seems to battle who she is. Great movie.","true":true}
