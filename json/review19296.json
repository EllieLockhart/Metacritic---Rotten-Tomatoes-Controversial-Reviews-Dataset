Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not terrible but it's not great either. As a sequel\\, it just doesn't work. Feels like Johnson ignored most of what happened in TFA and instead made a sequel to his version of TFA which no one has ever seen. There's a lot of unexpected decisions in this movie\\, but a lot of them don't work. The movie tries to preach this theme that sacrifice is bad\\, yet has two characters sacrifice themselves right before and right after that moment. And glorifies them for it. This movie just doesn't work. Only thing that holds me back from saying it's a bad film is Kylo Ren. The choices Kylo Ren and performance by Adam Driver are IMO the best part of the movie.","true":true}
