Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the movie. It's not perfect\\, but no movie is.\\n\\nI loved the idea that that the light side and the dark side are forces that must be balanced (light and dark as equals)\\, and not that one must overpower the other. Another welcomed surprise was the fallibility and the flaws of the characters; Luke\\, Leia\\, Poe\\, Rey\\, Kylo... they are all HUMANS; they can fail; they can make mistakes and that's good\\, everyone can make a bad decision because NO ONE in perfect\\, not even legends such as Leia and Luke.\\n\\nI am sad that so many people didn't like the movie but everyone is different\\, what I like doesn't necessarly have to be liked by someone else; what i hate is that I've seen some people angry at EP.VII because it was too similiar to the old ones\\, and claimed they wanted something new\\, but now are pissed that EP.VIII is different from the previous installmets and i find that ridiculous (pick a side!).","true":true}
