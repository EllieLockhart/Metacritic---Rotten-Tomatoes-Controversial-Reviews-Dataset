Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great Star Wars movie. Does it have flaws? yes. But it's a powerful entry in the saga. I love this universe and this is one of the most impactful episodes for me.","true":true}
