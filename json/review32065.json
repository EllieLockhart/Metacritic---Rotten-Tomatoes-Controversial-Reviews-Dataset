{"101487":169480,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers!\\n\\nI just saw it with one of my best friends ever\\, whom I have watched 3 straight films with\\, and had a good time.\\n\\nI have MAJOR criticisms of it\\, tho:\\n\\nThe plot line of the second in command keeping her plan a secret was dumb. I'm sorry\\, but they mishandled it.\\n\\nThe whole Finn\/Rose plot was engaging\\, but entirely useless. Especially annoying was Rose preventing Finn from sacrificing himself. More on that later\\n\\nThe amount of training to be a Jedi is getting shorter and shorter. The one thing that the prequels got right was showing how long and arduous the training is. Even ROTJ did a decent job of making a shortened training be useful. Rey literally learned to be a Jedi master in 24 hours\\, and her going to Kylo and Snoke was essentially a ripoff of ROTJ\\, but with a highly telegraphed twist.\\n\\nLuke's character was just stupid as shit for no real reason. Here's the guy whose faith brought the biggest bad guy to the light side\\, and because he sensed a touch of darkness in Kylo\\, he acted impulsively\\, and almost killed him\\, but didn't have the foresight to realize that killing someone in the way he almost did\\, is the act of a Sith Lord.\\n\\n\\nI'm fine with the thought that true balance of the force would be to not be a Jedi\\, nor a Sith\\, but they pissed away that entire thought process.\\n\\nAs with the Finn plot line\\, the \\\"darkness beneath the island\\\" was a waste of time.\\n\\nBack to Finn\/Rose. Having him fall in love so quickly with Rose\\, and Rey immediately with Poe is the laziest thing that's ever been done in a Star Wars film. The prequels suffered from poor directing\\, and wooden acting\\, but at least George put some serious thought into that romance*.\\n\\nAlso\\, the film completely wasted the character of Snoke. All this mystery of the last film\\, out of the window. He was basically a one dimensional character here. Manipulating Kylo and Rey was pretty cool. \\n\\nIf Kylo was telling the truth about Rey's parents\\, and I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and assume he's not\\, but if he was\\, then Rey being as powerful as she is\\, is fucking stupid. Anakin was created by a virgin mother\\, possibly with help from Palpatine\\, Luke and Leia had the strongest force user as a father\\, but Rey has random nobodies for parents\\, which makes it yet another example of lazy writing to avoid having to explain her background\\, but also a lazy way to allow Kylo to have the hots for her. \\n\\nAlso\\, how many times are we going to go to the well on Skywalker men acting like emotionally stunted teenagers? \\n\\nAnother thing: how the hell did both Luke and Yoda not know Rey took the books? If Yoda knew\\, it was retarded to keep that a secret. \\n\\n\\nLuke's whole fake teleportation was a cheap gimmick that never happened before in the Star Wars series\\, and was obviously only used due to poor writing. \\n\\nFinally\\, this movie took absolutely no risks\\, and highly telegraphed 2 major events\\, namely that Kylo would kill Snoke and that Luke showed up\\, only to stall Kylo so that everyone could escape. They could have had Rey turn to the Dark Side\\, Leia or Finn sacrifice themselves\\, or make Luke die an original death\\, but they took the safest decision every time\\, and there's not much mystery after the film\\, and it's pretty obvious that the next film will be Rey being all powerful\\, and defeating Kylo. The whole \\\"they received our message\\, but did nothing\\\" is too obviously a reason to get to Luke's sacrifice\\, but will have them helping next time. \\n\\nI'm fully aware of the theme of this movie being \\\"patience is essential\\\" but every single example is lazily written. \\n\\nThe third trilogy is better than the prequel trilogy\\, but only because George Lucas did a shitty execution of his ideas.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAgain\\, had fun watching it\\, but this movie is too flawed to recommend to anyone who didn't already want to watch it \\n\\n\\n*When you consider that Padme and Anakin have been largely isolated from people their own age\\, and that they're young and in love\\, their cringey behavior makes a lot of sense.","true":true}
