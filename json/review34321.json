Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action and cinematic's were beautiful\\, dare I say breathtaking. The story was more interesting than TFA and I finally cared about these characters. However\\, this new trilogy feels hollow. As if this wasn't how the next big chapter of Star Wars was meant to look like. It rely's on too many callbacks to older episodes. Basically if you're not a hardcore fan\\, it's a good movie. If you are a hardcore fan\\, it's still a good movie.. but it doesn't feel right. And I just can't get past that feeling.","true":true}
