Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an utter disappointment and is arguably the worst movie of the Star Wars franchise.  Yes\\, the cinematography is great and there are a few battle scenes that are fun.  However\\, as soon as I witnessed the \\\"prank phone call\\\" bit at the beginning of the movie\\, I knew it was going to be a disaster.  Also\\, a shirtless Kylo Ren?  Really?  Apparently Disney is trying to turn Star Wars into a campy-disaster like the Batman movies of the 90's.","true":true}
