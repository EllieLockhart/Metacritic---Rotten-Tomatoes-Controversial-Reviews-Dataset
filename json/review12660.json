Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I confess I am not a serious Star Wars fan- I have a casual interest but due to the huge cultural significance I try to keep up with them. \\nI have to totally agree with the fans who have slated this film. It is far too long. It makes no sense. Some of the scenes and plot turns are ridiculous and come from nowhere. I have often thought the Jedi and the Force a bit inconsistent in what they can do \\, to say the least\\, but now it feels like nothing more than a plot device \\, a bit like Dr Who's sonic screwdriver- sometime it can crack open open a portal into another dimension and sometimes it can't open a can of beans! One minute Luke can't be found \\, the next the good jedi woman and baddie man are snap chatting away \\, Carrie Fisher is coming back to life and flying through space and Yoda has turned into Zeus !? And Luke's confrontation with baddie jedi at the end is the biggest cop-out I have ever seen in film. It was the equivalent of a story ending with ' and then I woke up and it was all a dream.'!","true":true}
