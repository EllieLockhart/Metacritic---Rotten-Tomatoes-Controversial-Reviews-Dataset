Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this film three times\\, trying to like it. I am a die hard star wars fan. grew up wanting to be Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson has no respect for Star Wars or its lore. I didn't have any emotion. Walking out of the theater\\, I realized I had never felt this way before. This movie had removed all of my emotions for Star Wars\\, and I didn't care about anyone in this film. This is a disgrace to the great Star Wars saga.","true":true}
