Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals and Music are fantastic!  However\\, once you take all the twists or Gochta ya moments plus all the call backs to the OT\\, there is not much of a story and the slowest plot for a starwars movie.   I would not recommend this movie to a hard core fan but it should be fine for kids.   Most of the jokes fell flat and some of the serious scenes were laughed at during the movie.  It felt like a bad Marvel movie more than SW.  Maybe the next movie will fix this one but I was hoping this one would fix some problems in TFA.","true":true}
