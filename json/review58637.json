It throws you through the emotional ringer time after time\\, and can at time be a little exhausting. It's perhaps a little overlong. But overall\\, i think the messages within are justified. The story is well-written. A simple revenge tale told well. I won't reveal it's multiple twists and turns (although i'm pretty sure the entire world knows them by now) but by and large it's a compelling experience. The graphics are what you expect from a Naughty Dog release and are incredible\\, easily the best of the generation. My only issue with the visuals are more often than not you're forced into dark spaces where it can be difficult to navigate. I had to adjust my settings away from the recommended brightness just to navigate a couple of sequences.\r\rOverall i think the narrative beats are welcome\\, and although i loved both games i hope this is the last foray in the world of the last of us\\, as i don't think the world will ever be ready for a continuation on Ellie's journey. Great game which\\, i will no doubt play again at some point in the future! Highly recomended!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
