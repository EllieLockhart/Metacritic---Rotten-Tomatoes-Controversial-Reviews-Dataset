Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the first time I was just surprised by many unexpected moments.  I saw the first star wars opening day in 1977 and have been there ever since.  my friend Joe worked on the original and I was there in the parking lot of an old egg factory to see it go boom.\\n\\nThe new flick\\, THE  LAST JEDI\\, after 4 viewings in a week may be my favorite.  some complain about unanswered questions. well we did not learn the Emperors story until the prequels and it never detracted from Empire or Jedi.  \\n\\nThe message of hope\\, the promise of a new generation rising to fight the first Order is wonderful.  If you came to see Luke\\, it's worth the wait and so much more on multiple viewings.  Not sure why the low audience rating\\, the audiences I saw it with were enthusiastic\\, to say the least.\\nI understand how some trying to figure out origins of new characters may be a bit put off as all the speculation really didn't matter at all.\\n\\nEnjoy the ride!","true":true}
