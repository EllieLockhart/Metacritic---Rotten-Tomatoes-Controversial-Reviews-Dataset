Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a giant piece of trash. Plots that go nowhere\\, World breaking and incoherent. Would it be so hard to get a decent writer for such a huge franchise?","true":true}
