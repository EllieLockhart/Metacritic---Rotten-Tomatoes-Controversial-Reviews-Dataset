Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I Loved it and I hated it. It was funny when the movie started everyone cheered. When the movie ended there was silence. That silence was the sound of disappointment and audiable acknowledgement death of something we all loved. There were lot of parts of the movie I absolutely loved. And then there were lots of parts where I felt life long Star Wars fans were being given the middle finger. For life long fans\\, be prepared for disappointment and frustration. For spouses that are not really fans but are going to the movie to appease your significant other: enjoy. It is a fun ride. A long ride\\, but a fun one. Last point\\, my 2 daughters thought it was awesome. To JJ Abrams: Good luck writing episode 9\\, because life long Star Wars fans are pissed. My advice: go Crouching Tiger Hidden Light Saber with it. Or do a 2 hour movie about JarJars back story and how he was really raised by Porgs. One will get your true fan back. The latter is what we expect at this point. I'm going to go have a funeral for my childhood now. Namaste.","true":true}
