Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie made to date.\\nPoor storytelling and character decisions.\\nFilled with SJW tones that has no place in this movie. \\nWhen I watch star wars\\, I want to be entertained not told what to think about social issues.\\nDisney really messed up this franchise sadly I am now done with star wars.","true":true}
