Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy moly. The film does not pick up where the last movie left us.The Resistance blew up Starkiller Base\\, the probably most resource-eating project in the history of the universe\\, and the First Order emerges from that incident stronger than before? That's just the first of a whole barrage of plot holes that make this by far the least gripping SW movies ever made. The apparent lack of logical thinking in the writing room leaves me dumbfounded.","true":true}
