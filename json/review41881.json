Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the worst Star Wars movie by a long way. trivialises and cheapens the force as a concept. treats the iconic character of luke skywalker appallingly for no reason other than to destroy this iconic archetypal male character and to lessen the inspiring quality of his hero's journey in the OT. this is post modern nihilistic garbage hiding behind some pretty cgi and social justice nonsense. i could go on but its all been said many times already. don't waste your money on the dvd when it's released.","true":true}
