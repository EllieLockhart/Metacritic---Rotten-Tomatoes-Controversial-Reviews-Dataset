Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi exceeded my expectations for a Star Wars movie. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the force awakens\\, this movie opens new and exciting doors for Star Wars in the future. Interesting dynamics between characters\\, ie. Rey and Kylo Ren\\, coupled with stunning CGI makes this movie extremely entertaining.","true":true}
