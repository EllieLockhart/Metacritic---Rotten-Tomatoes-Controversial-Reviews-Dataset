Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't mind at all if the director wants to take Star Wars into a different direction\\, or do something different. I was hoping they would change things up and break from the formula......\\n\\nBut none of it matters if the story just sucks. It was boring. I've never nodded off during a Star Wars movie before\\, not even the Prequels were this boring.\\n\\nBy the 2 hour mark\\, I no longer cared about any of the story arcs. I just wanted the movie to end.","true":true}
