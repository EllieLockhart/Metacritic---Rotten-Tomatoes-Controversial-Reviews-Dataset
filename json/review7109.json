Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ended with more questions than answers.  All the intrigue and plot lines from TFA is quickly snuffed out in this new installment.  Cheap comedic throwaway lines and scenes make the movie awfully cringey.  Hux is now the Jar Jar Binks of this trilogy.","true":true}
