Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a hard movie to decide on because there's a lot that I enjoyed about the movie but also a lot that I disagreed with.\\n\\n*Spoilers AHEAD!!*\\n\\nFirst the things I liked;\\n- The choreography was fantastic.\\n- The visuals stunning.\\n- I actually really enjoyed all the scenes with Rey and Kylo\\, as well as all the choices they made for the characters.\\n- I actually like that Snoke was killed off\\, because it was unexpected and helps better develop Kylo as the main villain.\\n\\nAlright now the things I didn't like;\\n- Pretty much most of the decisions about Luke. I very much agree with what Mark Hamil said should be done with the character\\, if you haven't watched his interview I would recommend it. I'm not against killing off his character but I felt it could have been done a lot better.\\n- The humour just felt off\\, like not a star wars movie.\\n- The throwaway asian character\\, I honestly can't remember her name because she left so little of an impact.\\n- Princess Leia should have been the one killed in this film.\\n- The Casino scenes were kinda pointless. You could argue that this was done to introduce DJ and give Finn more development\\, but if DJ doesn't have a big part in the next movie it's rather pointless.\\n\\nOverall I think it was a good movie\\, I just think that the above decisions hurt the film.","true":true}
