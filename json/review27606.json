Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over-hyped film for children. The old Star Wars was nothing too original or special\\, Darth Vader with his Samurai helmet combined with a World War II gas mask\\, swordplay\\, space Nazis and their World War II Storm Troopers\\, etc.\\, but at least the original movies were coherent and were well written. This movie on the other hand  is just *really bad* in every way except perhaps the \\\"the effects\\\"\\, which one can get from video games nowadays. Everyone I was with\\, they were bored and at the end of the film each person felt like it was a time waster\\, even the children.","true":true}
