But enthusiasm was literally alternated by the anarchy of the fan base.\rThe first part was one of the best games I've ever played. The game had everything you wanted from a great story game Story\\, characters\\, emotions\\, graphics.\rThe last of Us 2 is exactly the opposite of the first part.\rI'll start with the positives\\, graphics as always from the Naughty Dog studio gorgeous\\, panoramas of flooded Seattle alternating snowy mountains and villages reminiscent of the Middle Ages\\, just a feast for the eyes.\rThe game is very shocking\\, both positively and negatively. You get to know the character\\, you start to like her\\, and in 4 hours ABBY will pierce her head with her manly hand that even Dwayne Johnson would envy her. Acting performances better than in any million-dollar film and you will know from the facial expressions of the characters what they really think and feel. Also\\, of course\\, flshback passages with Joel and Tommy\\, where I felt like I was playing the first part\\, and this is how the game was supposed to start\\, and a slightly improved gameplay. And that's all.\rThere are many negatives\\, we start with the decision of characters who behave as if they had an Alzheimer and did not know where he is\\, this ability is dominated by Ellie who could live a happy life with Dina and the child\\, but simply has to for ABBY whom she is not even able to kill everything\\, and the utterly repulsive effort of the creators to make Ellie a completely unthinking\\, heartless monster that kills dogs and who knows maybe demonstrates in the evenings.\rI'll move on to the most painful thing\\, and that's ABBYE\\, remember that name because after it's over\\, you'll be haunted in the evenings by a very tasty sex scene that has as much to do with sex as Germany and peace.\rA completely dysfunctional character with whom\\, after beating Joel with a golf club\\, it is simply impossible to identify. And I honestly don't even remember her story because it was taken to the extreme\\, as was the story of the whole game. Why I have to play Flashbeck in Flachbeck on Flashbek under Flashbek just doesn't bother me. The end of the story is like\\, it could just be over\\, but I'll stretch it by 6 hours and I won't even talk about the final fight with Abby.\rI didn't mind the presence of LGBT and everything because it just made sense and it wasn't crammed everywhere.\rFor me\\, The Last of Us is a huge disappointment and a demonstration that everyone should make their own opinion on the game\\, and not follow reviews\\, such as mine.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
