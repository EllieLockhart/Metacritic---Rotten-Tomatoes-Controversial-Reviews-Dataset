Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Righteousness and politics do  not go hand and hand. Same thing with Disney and Star Wars. The characters and their personalities were extremely bland\\, their origins not as interesting\\, the new characters were incredibly boring\\, the plot was terrible\\, and worst of all\u2026 they misrepresented Luke Skywalker.\\n  Grade score:F+","true":true}
