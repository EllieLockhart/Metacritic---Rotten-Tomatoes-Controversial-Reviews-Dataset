Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it sucked with painfully stupid jokes I would expect from transformers movies\\, unintentionally funny moments like when Princess Leia suvives an explosion goes into space and then flys like supermen because plot conviniance. The plot (if your willing to call it that) was as light as a feather for a two and a half hour flick\\, stupid characters that make catastrophic choices and painfully shoehorned messages amongst a plethora of other problems.","true":true}
