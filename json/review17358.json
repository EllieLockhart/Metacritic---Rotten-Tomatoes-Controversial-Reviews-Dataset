Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I respect that other people can like this movie a lot.  Also I have the utmost respect for the actors who did phenomenal work portraying their characters.  Truly great acting.  I can even respect that Rian Johnson had the confidence to tell a story he wanted to tell without regard for anyone's else's opinions.  Bold decisions and great hard work from all involved.  It's obvious that many people have their best efforts in this endeavor.\\n\\nAnd for some this movie was a master piece.\\n\\nBut even heartfelt and sincere efforts can end up being monumental disasters.  Only time will tell if this film ends up being a blip of dissension in an otherwise beloved franchise\\, or the final straw in unraveling the most devoted pop culture fan base of the twentieth century.\\n\\nFor me personally this was the final straw.  I will never spend another dime on a Star Wars product\\, be that movie\\, game\\, lunchbox\\, or LEGO.  Your decisions in The Last Jedi have ruined my personal feelings on the franchise.  And while it is only a movie\\, and while it doesn't belong to me\\, my money does.  And my money will stay firmly in my wallet regarding Lucas Film from now on.","true":true}
