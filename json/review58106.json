{"101487":198550,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars Movie ever. Just wait for the DVD. Here are clear explanations on why this movie is total garbage:\\n\\n1. Mark Hamill performs very well his character\\, but his character has nothing to do with Luke Skywalker. In fact\\, Not Even Once will you see Luke in the movie. You will just see Mark Hamill playing some kind of old Jedi\\, with not one ounce of who Luke Skywalker was.\\n\\n2. There's no main plot. Just rebels trying to escape trusting an annoying guy (Poe) who seems to be the only pilot available so everyone just does what he says. Try to enjoy as poe sends finn and some mechanic girl to a Casino for some plot details that are even more boring. Meanwhile\\, Ren is on vacation on an island\\, trying to be a Jedi in 3 lessons. (Because you know\\, the director wants to break the whole \\\"training\\\" thing and be innovative! \\\"woW! Jedi in 3 lessons! That's new!). Maybe there's also an App to be a Jedi?\\n\\n3. Everything established in the Force Awaken\\, is destroyed just to shock the audience. So you go \\\"WOW! WTF!\\\". But once it's destroyed\\, it's replaced with... nothing. The aftermath of the 2nd Act is you thinking that you won't need to go the the theaters for the 3rd one cause this one destroyed any reasons for you to go.\\n\\n4. Disney's new trend of making fun of its own movie is getting annoying. It's awesome with Guardians of the Galaxy\\, but with Star Wars? Really? Han Solo was great at being that guy who doesn't believe in the Force so it was ok for him to make fun of the force\\, but Rey and Luke? Throwing rocks at the Force and the Jedi myth? I mean\\, ok\\, it's a boring myth\\, and I understand that it deserves some criticism\\, but that's not up to the Jedi Protagonists!\\n\\n5. Without Han Solo\\, Star Wars doesn't work. Believe it or not\\, the Star Wars trilogy is not about the Skywalers\\, but about Han Solo. Forget the Prequels\\, forget the Last Jedi. Without Han Solo\\, this is just a huge mess.\\n\\n6. This new trend of \\\"Women Power!\\\" and \\\"Chinese characters for the Chinese Market\\\" is getting annoying. Ethnic presence in movies is mandatory\\, I get that\\, but when you put a character just for a Market\\, it becomes too much on the nose\\, and breaks any immersion the audience can get. What I mean is that as soon as you see a Chinese character you know that that character will do something heroic.\\n\\n7. If you are a Star Wars fan\\, and you go see this one\\, you will know that there's nothing for you in the next episode of the new Trilogy.","true":true}
