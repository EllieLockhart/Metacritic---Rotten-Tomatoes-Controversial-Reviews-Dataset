Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would have all my dreams of a future Star Wars trilogy destroyed twice in a life time. The prequels were awful\\, but the two latest installments of Star Wars no. 7 and no. 8 are even more of a disappointment. When I saw Empire Strikes Back as a child and bought the Companion Magazine that was sold in the lobby of the Cinema\\, it was in this Magazine I read that Lucas had planned on more films and that Star Wars was actually number 4 in the series. That fueled my imagination for years. In the end the acquisition of Star Wars by Disney has proven to be the most fatal blow to the Cinematic Universe I loved as a child.","true":true}
