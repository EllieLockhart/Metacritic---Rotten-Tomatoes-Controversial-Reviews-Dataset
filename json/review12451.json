Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why some fans may have not liked it or liked it and still be disappointed but......This is the Star Wars movie we need even though some might not have wanted. If Star Wars is to continue\\, this movie is a great catalyst for that.","true":true}
