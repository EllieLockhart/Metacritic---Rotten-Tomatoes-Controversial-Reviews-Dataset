{"101487":131310,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't usually bother to review things\\, but the viewer rating on the Last Jedi has me confused. I'm hoping the rating improves after more people have seen it\\, or even seen it a second time. (I liked it WAY more the second time.) There's a lot to unpack here\\, and a lot of subtle detail that gets lost in the frantic pace the first time through. The movie is different; is that why movie-goers are giving poor reviews? Please tell me they're not the same ones who complained Force Awakens was too derivative!!! Yes there are flaws\\, some plot points that don't make sense if you apply logic (why in the world does the First Order chase them for 18 hours at sub-light speed when some of their ships could just light jump ahead and cut them off?)\\, and some awkward moments. But damn\\, I had a blast and it felt like Star Wars. Except it was different. Well played Rian and team\\, you were under immense pressure and unrealistic expectations\\, and you delivered a helluva fun ride! Seeing a third time tomorrow with my kids :-)","true":true}
