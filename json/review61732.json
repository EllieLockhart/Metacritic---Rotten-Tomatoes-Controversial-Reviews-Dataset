I rarely replay games because I always have so many others to play and never enough time to do so. However the second I finished I wanted to get straight back into it. It\u2019s also not often I buy a game at release let alone preorder. I wait for sales for pretty much everything. I preorder this and did not regret it.I love the gameplay and really like trying different ways to take out enemies both human & infected. As well as trying to sneak through whole encounters untouched. Several parts made my heart race and I was trying so hard in real life to hear any little sound or spot movement\\, especially for stalkers. The game is dark and there\u2019s lots of parts that genuinely pulled at my heartstrings. I hope there\u2019s gonna be dlc or something like that because the ending felt a little missing. I get that not everyone likes the same things in a video game\\, but I wish people got less upset about someone enjoying something they don\u2019t.I like story driven games. I like survival style games. I loved the 1st game. So for me this was a great buy and I would definitely recommend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
