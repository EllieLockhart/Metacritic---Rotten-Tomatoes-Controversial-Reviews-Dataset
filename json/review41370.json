Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mess.. riddled with cheesy Disney jokes and one liners.. Luke barely even trains Rey and then at the end he disappears (dies) for no reason and joins the Force ending his long awaited come back which was uneventful... ruining decades of character development... I enjoyed the Force Awakens and what it would lead to with the series and it just ended up in complete sh*t.","true":true}
