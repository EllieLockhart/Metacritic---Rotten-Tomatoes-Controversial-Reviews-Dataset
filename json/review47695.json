Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first watched it\\, I was in shock and really didn't know how to felt about it. After watching it a second time\\, I decided I loved this movie. I LOVE the themes of this movie: you don't have to come from an epic family to be a hero\\, you have to wisely choose when to fight and when to retreat\\, and there are blurred lines in good vs evil. This movie is so refreshing. Definitely evolves the Star Wars saga for the better.","true":true}
