Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor overall. Just doesn't seem like a SW movie. I've loved all of the others\\, even Phantom Menace\\, but this just doesn't seem to work. Too much comedy\\, a lot of unnecessary and feeble dialogue\\, crazy action (Leia survives in space?!)\\, bizarre moments - Luke chucking his light saber and milking a creature - and just a strange plot sequence. The codebreaker stuff was badly explained and the disposal of Snoke just silly - how could he not sense what Kylo Ren was up to? I wasn't too sad about Snoke departing though as he just didn't look right - more like a Harry Potter character. Also\\, I couldn't get over how useless the First Order were in trying to dispose of the resistance when attacking their ships and the conveniently sited rebel base. The worst though just had to be the ridiculous creatures looking after the Jedi island - it was like Toad of Toad Hall in a nightie. So disappointing. Oh well\\, things can only get better; just hope Rey spends less time crying in the next one ....","true":true}
