Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the poor reviews on here have really made me laugh. I think they\u2019re problem is that they want the same experience they had when they first saw tar wars; it\u2019s silly to think like that because that won\u2019t happen. I was super happy with this film! It was fresh while throwing little homages to the original. ","true":true}
