Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long fan i was beyond excited for rian johnson's take on SW. i can see now that my faith in him was misplaced. i understand every reason why top critics liked this movie while audiences and especially sw fans do not. i for one hated it the first viewing. i hoped maybe i missed the point or something went wrong with my brain on that first viewing. it was only worse the second time. it is an okay average movie... yet a terrible star wars movie. how rian as a life long sw fan could not understand what to do and what kind of story to tell is still impossible to believe. as someone who watches the films (even the prequels) often\\, i can honestly say i will never see this movie again. and I consider it the worst of any star wars movie ever made.","true":true}
