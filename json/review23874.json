Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mainstream critics want to invalidate my rating by saying I'm a bot. But I'm a REAL PERSON who hated this movie.\\nSo many other real reviewers have already listed at length the horrible failures of this movie I won't bore you by repeating them.\\nBut I will stress that the movie is ruined by the pathological need to focus on so-called \\\"progressive\\\" political and social issues\\, not the least of which is the subtext that all men are idiots and only women are truly wise leaders.\\nThe movie is grim\\, depressing\\, disappointing\\, illogical\\, nonsensical\\, and a true failure in every sense of the word. The action is not exciting. The characters are not engaging. The plot is so stupid it's insulting.\\nIf this movie didn't carry the Star Wars label it would be an abject failure at the box office. No one left the theater smiling or happy or excited. The entire audience was subdued and pretty unhappy. No applause at the end of the movie\\, just sad silence. No whoops of delight or excitement during the movie\\, just quiet boredom or stunned disbelief at the underwhelming antics.\\nRead the other reviews for point-by-point iterations of the stupidity of the plot and wrong-headedness of the direction.\\nA sad\\, sad day for the Star Wars canon. This movie will long be remembered as a huge disappointment and an embarrassment\\, probably considered even worse than The Phantom Menace (words I though I'd never say about any SW movie).\\nShame on you\\, Disney.","true":true}
