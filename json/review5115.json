Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics must have been paid off by Disney.  Just look at the spread between the critic and audience scores and it's obvious something is off.  As a standalone movie I would have given this two stars\\, as a Star Wars sequel it is a one.  I could write pages detailing what was wrong with it but the word pointless sums it up well enough.  Really disappointing after Force Awakens and Rogue One which both deserved to carry the Star Wars name and in my opinion fall just behind Empire and New Hope for Star Wars films.","true":true}
