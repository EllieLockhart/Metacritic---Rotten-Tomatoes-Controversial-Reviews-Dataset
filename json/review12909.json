Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think the new trilogy could get any worse but...here we are. Characters are STILL lacking in personality. Even though episode 7 re-used a story it was far better than this movie's story.","true":true}
