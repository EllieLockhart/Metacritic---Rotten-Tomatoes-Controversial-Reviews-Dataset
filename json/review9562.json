Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good for the most part\\, but not as good as the previous 2.  Too many zingy one-liners and aimed a little too much at a younger crowd.  The Force Awakens was better.","true":true}
