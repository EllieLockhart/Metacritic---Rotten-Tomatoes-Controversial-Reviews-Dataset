We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Finished the whole game. Narrative and storytelling wise this game is atrocious. The scene cuts and flashbacks have no order and only hurts the player experience and adds confusion which is never resolved. If you enjoyed the first last of us game then be warned\\, the devs really made it their mission in this game to tear down everything we loved and enjoyed from the predecessor in hopes to \\\"subvert expectations\\\" but it backfired and is arguably worse Game of Thrones' 8th season. The narrative choices feel forced in a bad way\\, extremely edgy\\, genuinely confusing\\, and downright nonsensical at times. The major problem I have with this game is that the plot lines go nowhere and it doesn't even leave you on an ominous note. It feels as if you played and finished the game for nothing\\, since nothing is actually achieved. Gameplay wise\\, there's no standout generational improvements from the ps3 era and enemy mob entities are reused multiple times throughout the game; it feels like you're fighting the same 10 zombies and humans. The enemy AI is also terrible\\, you'll have no trouble getting through the game's most difficult areas which there are very few of since the enemies are unable to detect you behind the smallest of covers. Only positive I could think of is the voice acting and even that gets tiring since the majority of this game is just cutscenes and dialogue while walking from one point to another without any significant gameplay events occuring. 1\/10 because they ruined such a loved franchise. SAVE YOUR MONEY\r\rBtw\\, don\u2019t pay attention to the \u201c95% good\u201d critics. They just love money $$$.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
