Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spearheaded by the yearning to \\\"let the past die\\\"\\, the Last Jedi murdered all preconceptions I had about the movie before I entered the theater. Most fans fully expected to walk away with several huge questions answered\\, familial ties to be discovered\\, and epic plot twists to ensue. Personally\\, I walked out of the theater wholly unbalanced\\, as I feel many others did. All of my expectations had been quashed\\, except for some serious plot twists\\, and I felt the movie had somewhat stolen that epic Star Wars-esque satisfaction from myself and the other die-hard fans. However\\, and this is a big 'however'\\, the Last Jedi infused a dose of uncertainty\\, charisma\\, and raw CHANGE that I feel the franchise needed. Yes\\, the plot was unwieldy and somewhat lopsided\\, but the character development soared to far more extraordinary heights than any Star Wars film before it; more so\\, even\\, than The Empire Strikes Back. Balanced with painfully emotional miniature character plots and overarching evolutions in Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, Poe\\, and Luke Skywalker\\, the characters themselves truly shined. Rian made it a point to focus on the characters' actions and evolving identities\\, NOT on their lineages and predetermined fates - a theme that strikes at the heart of conventional Star Wars lore. I'm left shaken\\, lost\\, even a little nauseous as I realize I truly don't know - at all - what will happen in the future of this series. Taking a page out of Yoda's book\\, I feel like fans must \\\"unlearn what [they] have learned\\\" to absorb the changes this installment introduces and accept the as-yet-undefined future of Star Wars.","true":true}
