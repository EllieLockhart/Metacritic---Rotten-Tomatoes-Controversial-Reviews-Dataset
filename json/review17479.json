Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is Disney trying to kill Star Wars? Out of nine movies this is the worst. Even 'The Phantom Menace' which is generally considered the worst movie is far superior to this.","true":true}
