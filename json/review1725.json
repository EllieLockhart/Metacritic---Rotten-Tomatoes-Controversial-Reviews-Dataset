Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone film it is watchable\\, however as a Star Wars film it is terrible.\\nFirstly the film is not at the same level in terms of imaginative worlds and story telling as episodes 1-6. What annoys me the most is that Disney have tried to make it too politically correct and feminist. When you look back at episode 1-6 decades later they are still classics. What makes this so is that they are distant worlds but familiar.\\nEpisode 7-9 you can watch and you can tell they are influenced by today's feminism and race equality. Also to make women look strong\/independent they need to make the men either evil or foolish. If it was true equality they would have some evil\/foolish women too!\\nRey is so perfect she can fight\\, fly\/repair the millennium falcon and use the force with no apparent training - all in episode 7. It took Luke episodes 4-5 to achieve less.","true":true}
