Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. The sub plot was pointless. No lightsaber on lightsaber fight. Holdo's sacrifice goes completely against Star Wars logic. Luke's persona makes no sense. His character is pessimistic and goes against his morales completely. The climax point of the movie Rey should have actually been stabbed in the back\\, but the weapon disappeared. Also there was a guard spinning pointlessly. Star Wars is not meant to be a comedy and have forced jokes it is supposed to have drama. This only proves Disney only cares about Quantity over Quality. Luke throwing his lightsaber over his shoulder just shows Hollywood only cares about money. At this rate\\, my personal belief Star Wars ended at episode 6.","true":true}
