Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a way to drop the ball on a $4bn investment.. The SW brand was so strong that it was simply impossible to screw it up. Enter Rian \\\"hold my beer\\\" Johnson.\\n\\nAll previously set up plot points were tossed out and weren't replaced with anything new. This might be a blessing in disguise for JJ Abrams as he tries to wrap up a story with a clean slate but a lot of viewers aren't invested in where the trilogy is going. Is it even going? Seems quite directionless.\\n\\nMultiple infringements on the SW universe and disregard of all previously established lore. I'm not interested in the political clutter that surrounds the critics vs supporters\\, man babies vs soy boys etc. It is just simply an utterly poor movie in terms of story telling and as a pivotal installment in a trilogy. It fails harder than anything has ever failed in human history.\\n\\nThe star rating only goes towards the cinematography. This movie is a visual feast. The picture and sound are stunning. One of the best I have ever seen!","true":true}
