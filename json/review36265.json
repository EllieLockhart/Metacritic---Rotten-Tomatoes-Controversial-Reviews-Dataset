Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last two movies were a disappoint in comparison to the story telling and character development found in George Lucas' episodes.  This last particular episode had an opportunity to capitalize the hype around the return of Luke Skywalker and it missed the mark miserably.  A lost opportunity with no  way to go back and set this right.  It's an unfortunate sign of this remarkable series of the first 6 episodes.  When there is a lack of creativity you find the typical story of bigger and badder.  Soulless story telling at it's worst.  Bring back George Lucas!!  And save the series!!","true":true}
