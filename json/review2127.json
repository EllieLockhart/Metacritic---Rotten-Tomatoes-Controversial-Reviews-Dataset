{"101487":106110,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A subversion of tropes to the point where nothing matters\\n\\nThe Force Awakens\\, as safe\\, fan-servicing and nostalgia-based it was\\, made at least one thing right - it set the stage for next movies due to the mysteries it touched but didn't bother to explain. Who is Snoke? What ancient powerful being is he? Where did he hide all these years? Who are Rey's parents? Why did they leave her in the middle of a fucking nowhere? Why is she so powerful quick learner in everything? Was she trained in the ways of the Force\\, but doesn't remember? Why Luke is gone? If he doesn't want to be bothered\\, why did he leave a map to his seclusion? Most of these questions constitute plot holes actually\\, and big parts of the TFA make sense only if next episodes explain it in a satisfactory way. Star Wars fans had a lot of material to speculate and craft sometimes crazy and head spinning theories. Which is good\\, since that gave hope that Sequel Trilogy may have some depth\\, smart plot-twists\\, and earned dramatic moments.\\nAnd here comes Rian Johnson with the Episode 8: The Last Jedi. Do you remember the final scene of the TFA\\, you know\\, that tense\\, shot from multiple angles scene\\, in which Rey's and Luke's facial expressions and body languages signalized that shit is serious? The very first scene set on that island in the TLJ is a direct continuation of that scene. What does Luke do\\, when Rey gives him the lightsaber? Throws it away like a an empty can. Shocking? Yeah\\, propably. Unexpected? You bet. But is it unexpected in a good way? Hell no. It's stupid\\, it's cheating\\, it's like writers didn't watch the TFA. It undermined the importance of everything what happened in the TFA that lead to the final scene. And it's only the beginning. Want to know who Snoke is? Nevermind\\, we kill the guy in the middle of the movie without hinting any backstory. Want to know who are Rey's parents? It doesn't matter\\, most propably nobody. And what about map? What map? We have revised that story line\\, now it's Ressistance that sent Rey to Luke. Want to know how the First Order\\, built on ashes of the Empire\\, managed to become a major force in the Galaxy\\, with resources to build a superweapon that dwarfes previous lethal spherical devices of the Empire? No nerdy politics here. That's propably the greatest sin of this movie - it dismisses it's own direct predecessor and throws away almost all hinges of the story set in the TFA\\, making the TFA nonsensical and pointless. And it deosn't stop here. Some pointed out an issue that if the force ghosts are the thing\\, then maybe Anakin Skywalker should have a stern talk with Kylo Ren and knock this morbid fascination with his burnt helmet in the head. In some convoluted way and some silent assumptions one could propably explain why force ghosts are not the thing anymore in the TFA\\, so the character arc of Kylo and his storyline still make sense. Well\\, not anymore\\, since it occures that force ghosts not only may appear\\, guide living characters\\, but also summon lightnings from the sky to burn things up! So maybe Anakin could have appeared\\, it could save several planets worth of lives.\\n\\nCharacters are too dumb too frequently\\, inconsistent\\, or their actions are inconsequential anyway for the sake of the plot\\n\\nRey thought it's a good idea to go alone to the Snoke's ship and surrender in order to turn Kylo Ren. Did she think that they have so strong bond that she can do this alone? Even if she succeeds\\, how do they escape\\, if no rare event\\, like being hit by lightspeed bullet\\, occurs?\\nSnoke sets and exploits a force connection between his emotionally unstable apprentice and Rey to hunt down a hermit on a distant planet\\, who decided to wait for death in solitude anyway.\\nAdmiral Holdo hides her plan from hot headed\\, known for authority questioning Poe Dameron\\, without other reason than to force Poe to mutiny.\\nFinn's and Rose's side quest is inconsequential at best or even makes things worse.\\nLeia has really nothing to do. Once she pulls off a force trick to bring her self back to the ship from outer space in a Marry Poppins way\\, but it's the first and the last time we see it. In the end of the movie she even says \\\"Why are you looking at me? Follow him.\\\" after Poe says \\\"Follow me!\\\". She knows better then we do that she's there only for an exposition.\\nAdmiral Holdo sacrifices herself\\, although one could expect that ships should be progrmmable to enter the hyperspace or have an autopilot.\\nKylo Ren smashes an elevator with his helmet due to his emotional turmoil which he cannot hide and later proves himself a master of occlumency.\\n\\nNonsensical bits and pieces\\n\\nTLJ also introduced a very dangerous way of destroying things in a very efficient way. Don't take me wrong\\, it's a great idea to make a bullet from ship with hyperdrive and just smash it against enemy's dreadnaught or flagship. It's desperate\\, it's spectular\\, it suits well the Rebels (erm... Ressistance). It's dangerous because it undermines every previous attempts to destroy big ships. It seems that no one needed to find a weak spots and make complicated plans to destroy\\, let's say\\, Death Stars or other spherical weapons of mass destruction\\, just one ship with a hyperdrive and working autopilot (or a crew willing to sacrifice) is enough.\\nIn the first scene Ressistance is dropping bombs on the dreadnaught\\, defying laws of physics and established technological level.\\nWriters try to make a lot of unearned drama and tension. That random Asian woman sacrifices herself? Nobody cares\\, since the movie hasn't spent any time to get to know her. Admiral Holdo sacrifices herself? Nobody cares\\, since nobody likes her\\, she made stupid decisions\\, and her sacrifice should be unnecessary anyway. Finn sacrifeces himself? It would mean something\\, but Rose stops him in quasi-sacrifice. The love confession is hardly believable and even Finn is stunned.\\nHumour is immersion breaking. Luke throws random one liners\\, although he is supposedly a broken old and bitter man when we meet him in TLJ. He drinks green goo from weird creature's tit. Temple cretakers seems to be there only to have their things smashed by accident. It's forced (no pun intended) and unnecessary.\\nMaybe I am too sensitive\\, but there was also some 4th wall breaking. When R2 shows Luke old recording of Leia from the New Hope\\, he says it's cheap. Yes it is\\, even more when you admit to it in the movie. Also\\, it seems\\, preparing for the backlash\\, one of the soldiers on the last planet tastes the white substance on the ground and comments \\\"salt!\\\". How subtle!\\n\\nAre there any redeeming qualities that movie has? Redeeming propably not\\, but visuals are outstanding\\, like they should in a moder blockbuster\\, camera work is great and it conveys emotions and point of views properly\\, music is\\, as always in Star Wars thanks to Williams\\, perfect. Unfortunatelly it doesn't help much in plot and character developement department.","true":true}
