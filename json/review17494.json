Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see the criticism. But most of them are like \\\"NOT MY LUKE\\\" which is totally incorrect because it's been like\\, 30 years and Luke Skywalker has changed. Every character deserves flaws. I think the movie's messages were good and just to say\\, the porgs are amazing. This is my favorite Star Wars movie for a reason.","true":true}
