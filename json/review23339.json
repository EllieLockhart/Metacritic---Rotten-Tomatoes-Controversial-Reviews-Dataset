Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Saw it twice (so far.) I'm a lifelong diehard fan of the saga\\, and I thought Rian Johnson's vision for the future of the saga is refreshing. Adam Driver is amazing...his range is astounding\\, and he pushes himself physically and emotionally in this role. Superb! Daisy Ridley gets to be funny\\, and it's adorable! She's incredible and perfect in this role. Her physical performance is just as admirable as Driver's\\, and they have undeniable chemistry on screen. Kelly Marie Tran's Rose is my new favorite girly character in the saga - I love her spunk. Carrie Fisher's performance was wonderful. There is just one scene I'd rather was executed differently\\, something that reminded me of the Statue of Liberty or Mary Poppins. Mark Hamill was fantastic\\, really pushing Luke to a new level. He embraced Johnson's vision of Luke\\, and I have a whole new respect for him as an actor because of this performance. Overall\\, I was thrilled. Long\\, yes. Envelope pushed\\, yes. But that's why I love Star Wars....just about anything goes.","true":true}
