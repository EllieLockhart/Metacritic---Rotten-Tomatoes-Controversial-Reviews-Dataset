Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" So I\u2019ve seen The Last Jedi a couple times now. My initial reactions from opening night\\, raw and untamed\\, was that I felt it had done a disservice to the story that I grew up loving. The disappointment was buoyed upon a sea of unmet expectations that I took into the film\\, including a desire for a certain character to be portrayed in a way I had imagined since I was 7 years old. It took me awhile to process the fact that my fan fiction wasn\u2019t going to come true. But before seeing it again\\, I did my best to really try to get into Rian Johnson\u2019s head. This is a director and writer who I trust; Brick\\, Brothers Bloom\\, and Looper are amongst my favorite films. I just couldn\u2019t understand why I was so cognitively disappointed in what I saw in Rian\u2019s vision for Star Wars so i tried to open my perspective a little more. I took this approach into my second viewing of the film\\, endeavoring to open my mind up and search for the nuance in the storytelling. Thankfully\\, I came away this time invigorated\\, and feeling like my eyes had been opened to what Star Wars is heading for. THE LAST JEDI got rid of some beloved elements from my childhood\\, but not in a brash\\, unrelenting way like I had originally thought. Instead\\, I realized that the filmmakers cherished every last part of Star Wars as much as I did\\, and that in removing the old to make way for the new\\, they were very honoring of the legacy of those that came before. There are issues. There are some story choices that I would\u2019ve preferred weren\u2019t made. The transition Rian Johnson takes Star Wars through in his movie is not perfect\\, but what transition worth making ever is? THE LAST JEDI takes us to new places\\, but if you\u2019re not careful to look around and take in the view and journey\\, you might miss it.","true":true}
