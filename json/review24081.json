Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive letdown. After seeing very positive reviews from critics I went in with high expectations. Wow was I wrong. This movie is a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. It's way too long\\, there is cheesy humor involved almost every 5 seconds\\, and every scene tended to drag on and on. I want to know what kind of movie the critics saw because I did not see the same film. Honestly surprised this was the final cut for the film it was that bad. Truly disappointed.","true":true}
