Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this. I really\\, really did. But the newest installation of the Star Wars saga is soulless\\, fluffy marketing\\, not purposeful storytelling. They had such an opportunity\\, but fell flat due to an overabundance of silly\\, pointless humor\\, misappropriated backstories and side stories that were all for naught\\, plot holes and cringe-worthy implausibilities. I have been going to watch Star Wars films my entire life\\, and this is the only one that when it ended I left the theater questioning whether I actually liked it or not. Ultimately it fell to the not just because there were too many times that I was not saying \\\"Wow\\, that was really great!\\\"  Instead I was saying \\\"Why would they do that?\\\" This is the ninth film in this Saga\\, and of course not all of them can be perfect. But I really hope that the next film tries to rectify some of the pitfalls of The Last Jedi.","true":true}
