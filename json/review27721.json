Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People complained that TFA was too much like the old movies\\, now they\u2019re complaining that this isn\u2019t enough like the old movies. I thought this was a beautifully made movie that addresses Luke\u2019s exile and solidified Rey as the new hope. Luke went out as a legend\\, completing something that had never been seen before\u2014we even got to see Yoda teach him one more lesson! This trilogy is moving away from the Skywalkers...maybe people don\u2019t realize that. Hopefully after they see this movie they\u2019ll get it and move on. ","true":true}
