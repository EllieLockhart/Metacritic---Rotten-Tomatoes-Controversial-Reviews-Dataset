Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I feel this movie did many things right\\, I also feel it missed in the most important areas. The tone of the movie felt off for me. The resolution of plot points and build up were disappointing at best. Characters were criminally underused or written poorly. I doubt I will bother to see episode 9 in the theaters as I was disappointed by both 7 and now 8. Fool me once...","true":true}
