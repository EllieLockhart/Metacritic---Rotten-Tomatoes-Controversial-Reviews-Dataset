{"101487":175142,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a conundrum\\, on the one hand it\u2019s a great fun sci-fi comedy action movie\\, on the other it\u2019s a terrible Star Wars movie. For me\\, it ranks alongside The Phantom Menace as the worst in the saga\\, just for very different reasons. Firstly\\, it feels more like a Marvel movie than Star Wars\\, think a sort of Avengers tone and you\u2019re pretty much there. The abundant jokes\\, while funny\\, just don\u2019t sit with the other movies - there are too many and they\u2019re too low brow. I\u2019ll try to keep this spoiler free but it\u2019s difficult as much of my objections relate to respect for the saga\\, its overarching lore\\, and its characters. Firstly\\, Rian Johnson rewrites the Force rulebook - things that (even in terms of the force) feel impossible are now commonplace. Death\\, seemingly now comes at little cost. One scene of space flight was beyond ludicrous. Furthermore\\, classic characters aren\u2019t afforded the respect (or exit) their place in many film goers hearts warrants\\, while new characters are given far better\\, memorable exits. This seemed more in deference to the actor \/ actress than the role they played. The whole Finn and Rose subplot is redundant and major cliff hangers from the Force Awakens result in anticlimax or a lack of answers\\, sometimes both. Worse still\\, in trying to make his mark on the saga\\, Johnson just hits a big reset button that to a large extent renders the journey and characters of Episode I to VII redundant. JJ Abrams now has an uphill battle to give any satisfactory conclusion to the 9 films. It felt like selfish filmmaking that was more interested in a place in history than the overall story arc.
