Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good fight scenes. That's about it. The storyline tried to portray the Skywalker's not important to this Star Wars storyline. When they are at the center of it. Not to mention the ridiculously dumb space floating scene of Leia\\, the let's just run through space until we run out of gas scenes and the waste of time code breaker search scenes. There was so much this film could have done and it wasted every effort to try and focus on Rian Johnsons own trilogy goal.","true":true}
