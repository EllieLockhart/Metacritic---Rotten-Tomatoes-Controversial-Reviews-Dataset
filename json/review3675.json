Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Betrayed everything that was good and right in the Star Wars universe.  A movie that was made for the critics and not for the fans.  A movie where Rian Johnson gives the middle finger to the fandom.  Shame on you!","true":true}
