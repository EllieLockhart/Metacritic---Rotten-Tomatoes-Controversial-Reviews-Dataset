Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Political\\, \\\"PC\\\" culture garbage. This didn't feel like Star Wars. It didn't even feel like a new TWIST on Star Wars. It felt like PC culture training school\\, with terribly choreographed lightsbaber views and weak attempts to get blood pumping as forced characters run through fake feeling peril. Absolute garbage.","true":true}
