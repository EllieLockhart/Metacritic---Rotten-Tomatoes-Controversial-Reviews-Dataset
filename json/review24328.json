Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[MILD SPOILERS ahead]. I can totally see why this Disney space-fantasy movie for children is so polarizing for jaded adults. Apparently some people dislike fun\\, which The Last Jedi unapologetically is. I loved it (I'm 39\\, fwiw) and my 70 year old parents genuinely loved it too (I can tell). I was absolutely riveted from start to finish. \\n\\nIf you're looking for Oscar-caliber performances or Criterion Collection-worthy filmmaking\\, look elsewhere. Why anyone would expect to find that from Star Wars is beyond me; hasn't ever been there since day 1\\, 1977. Now\\, if you're looking for\\, gee I don't know... Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi is Star Wars to the core. And\\, while it may not be the BEST installment\\, The Last Jedi was the funnest\\, funniest\\, and most unpredictable rollercoaster in Star Wars film history. But I get it... The Force Awakens was trash because it was too predictable\\, too much of a rehash (remember that stormtrooper who joined the Rebellion and became a central character in A New Hope?)... And The Last Jedi is trash because it's too UNpredictable and ruined classic characters (I can't believe cheerful\\, optimistic Luke was so negative and pessimistic in The Last Jedi... I mean\\, he was NEVER that way in the original trilogy\\, except every time he whined to Obi-Wan or Yoda about how he couldn't do this or that). Some people will never be satisfied. And sure\\, I have a lot of nits to pick with this latest installment in the saga\\, but that's always been part of the fun of Star Wars - obsessively picking it (and its creators) apart. Nonetheless\\, this was a fantastic Star Wars movie. Personally\\, it's in my top 3 - after ESB and TFA. It may move up or down a notch with the passage of time and subsequent viewings. However\\, nothing will ever detract from the pure joy I felt - after 2 full years of anticipation - finally watching it on Christmas Day. \\n\\nIf you don't understand Star Wars\\, don't love Star Wars\\, or if you once did\\, but weren't sold on the new characters introduced in The Force Awakens\\, sure\\, this might not be the film for you. Similarly\\, if you're a straight heterosexual male who enjoys naked ladies\\, gay male pornography might not be your cup of tea either. Go figure! However\\, I'm siding with the critics on this one. TLJ was epic! Episode IX can't come soon enough!","true":true}
