Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watched it for the second time... and it does not get better the more you see it. The plot holes become obvious\\, the lack of character development is frustrating... I feel like I've been played. If this is supposed to set the bar for Star Wars films going forward\\, we can expect more missed opportunities with a migraines worth of needless characters and content - we get it Disney\\, 'the cute small thing with big eyes that make you go awwww will make great toys!' \/s.","true":true}
