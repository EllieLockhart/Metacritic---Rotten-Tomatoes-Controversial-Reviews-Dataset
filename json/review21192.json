Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched every star wars movie and like it.\\nNot this one.\\nMen are all stupid. The story doesn't matter.\\nThe physics of the force have completely changed.\\nAll the female characters are pretty\\, perfect\\, never need to learn\\, everything just comes to them.\\nExactly the opposite of what i want to teach my daughter. I was excited to see Rae fail and learn and take time to become a jedi from hard work and determination like in every single other book movie tv show or video game ever! \\nWhat do young boys learn? That no matter what they are never smarter then a woman. Look I am really happy that woman are taking a huge leading role in films\\, but if your trying to correct the mistakes men made in the past by doing the same in the other direction then you haven't learned from our mistakes. Look woman aren't perfect just like men aren't perfect. If you want equality\\, then be equal. That being said\\, this is star wars? No.\\nThis is not star wars. \\nIt should be called something else like the last star fighter girls version.\\nDid i mention Luke Skywalker is the dumbest person in the universe now? Oh and even though he saved his child murdering father from the dark side\\, he decides to try and murder his nephew because he feels bad vibes when he sleeps.","true":true}
