Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from having several of the main characters revert to stereotypes and tropes\\, aside from cutting every tie to the Star Wars lore that made the other movies relevant to each other\\, and aside from removing major villains without adequate explanations or satisfactory effort\\, aside from several story arcs that do nothing to build the plot\\, the film is just a drawn out if visually striking chase scene.\\nI watched it hoping that something would redeem the chauvinism and nihilism of the movie; not only was I not rewarded at the end\\, I was punished.\\n\\nAs an isolated movie\\, it's too long for just a chase scene and much of the plot us unnecessary. It is beautiful to watch.\\n\\nAs part of the saga this film ripped away my love for the franchise in a way that not even Jar Jar Binks could.  The movie said it hated what I loved\\,  it hated me.  \\n\\nI'm going to go watch \\\"Solo\\\"  again and hope that Mr. Abrams can provide adequate resolution\/restitution.","true":true}
