Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it three times\\, I'm finally starting to come around on TLJ. The stuff I hated about it the first time\\, I still hate and it still brings the movie down a few notches\\, but I have a greater appreciation for the elements that did work. Ultimately\\, it's still a middle-of-the-pack SW movie\\, but not a horrible travesty either.","true":true}
