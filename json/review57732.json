Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very boring and poorly written - i was so excited to see Last Jedi after TFA\\, but Last Jedi was a very bad movie.  So disapointed in the plot holes\\, bad jokes\\, and cringe-worthy political jabs.  Therefore I do not consider this movie to be canon - As far as I'm concerned Star Wars \\\"ends\\\" after Ep. 6 \\, Luke & Leia train a new generation of Jedi\\, and this awful movie is just a nightmare had by Luke as he sleeps.  Rian Johnson has no business writing scripts - he is not creative\\, he is not talented - and its just very wrong that he was given the authority to make story decisions regarding Star Wars.  This movie had the potential to great\\, to be a classic\\, but Rian Johnson has no talent and wrote a completely stupid story.  I hope he  is fired from the upcoming trilogy\\, and a competent\/talented writer is hired instead.","true":true}
