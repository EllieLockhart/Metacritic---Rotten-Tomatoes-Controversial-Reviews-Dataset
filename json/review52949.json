Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone that has any appreciation for the true\\, legendary Star Wars franchise will watch this and be severely let down. Disney has taken this new-era and made it exactly that. It doesn't try to appeal to the generations that grew up on the classic Star Wars; it's one purpose is to appeal to children. That's it. That's why the story line sucks\\, that's why there's no meaningful character development\\, that's why Rey become's a \\\"Jedi\\\" overnight\\, that's why there's no backstory for any of the characters\\, that's why there's an out-of-place love story between two useless characters\\, that's why there are new\\, cute looking animals in every other scene\\, that's why there are no actual light-saber fights\\, & that's why there's a cheesy joke cracked every other scene. This is no longer the Star Wars that we know and love. It is a low effort script with a ton of CGI made to sell folders and backpacks with Star Wars print on them to elementary school kids. It's not about the story anymore\\, its about Disney making money.","true":true}
