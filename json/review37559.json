{"101487":178360,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a lot of controversy over this movie. Even though at first I hated it\\, it's going to get a sweet 5 stars from me and here is why. First I will talk about each controversy and how I\\, eventually\\, came to terms with it. WARNING SPOILERS: 1. Snoke dies\\, and is barely able to be labeled as a character\\, or a Sith for that matter. He is slain by his apprentice\\, and in a very wimpy way too. makes him seem like a very weak character with no purpose. Well\\, two things have brought me past that. First\\, I don't believe he was ever meant to be an all powerful Sith\\, at least for this trilogy. I believe his character was purely put forth to show the true power of Kylo Ren. Also\\, it shows that Kylo still doesn't really understand who he is or where he belongs in the balance of the force. Second\\, I believe that Snoke could still be alive. I think he is the embodiment of the darkside. I mean that he is more of an idea than an actual character. I believe there is still more to his story. 2. Phasma gets her butt kicked again. To make things shorter\\, I'll just say I doubt she is dead. 3. Luke is kinda a wimp in this movie. I believe his role was meant to be more of a supporting one. His purpose was to usher forth the next of the Jedi (Rey). 4. Its nothing like other Star Wars. This is true. Just about every plan made by the Resistance results in failure. This shows the unfathomable power of the first order\\, really outlining how the Resistance is nothing but a group of underdogs. Overall\\, as much dumb as it may seem\\, I believe this movie was purely made to show character development\\, as well as bridge us to the next movie. The only complaint I still have is how bad and forced the humor was. I had a couple of laughs\\, but Disney should just stick to a similar style of humor as seen in Rogue One\\, or have no humor at all. Overall\\, it was one of the best Star Wars movies in the franchise\\, and I look forward to the next.","true":true}
