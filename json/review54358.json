Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea why the audience score is so low\\, mybe super fans need to let go of the original trilogy and realize the filmakers are trying to create an original piece that entertains more then just the detailed obsessed star wars fans that are butthurt with luke dying This movie was fantastic and much better then TFA which essentially was made for star wars superfans. Youve had your movies its time to move on from what you know to something new and exciting.","true":true}
