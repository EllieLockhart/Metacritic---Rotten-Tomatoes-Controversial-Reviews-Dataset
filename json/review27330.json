Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the surface it's entertaining\\, but lacks a strong formal design in story telling and development of themes and motives. They focused too much on the graphics and CGI\\, and marketing\\, in which\\, they succeeded. In a business perspective\\, it is a huge success. I didn't even mind the unexpected plot twists (for example: rey's parents among others)\\, and would have supported them as long as it was developed well.","true":true}
