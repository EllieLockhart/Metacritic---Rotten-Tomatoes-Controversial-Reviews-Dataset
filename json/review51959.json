Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh entry in the franchise that guarantees there will be more stories to tell for a long time. This movie is nothing you expect it to be\\, and that's why it's brilliant. It blows every expectation out of the water.","true":true}
