Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor to non-existent character development.  Terrible film.  The kids and I did have a good time locating all the plot holes and terrible decisions made by directors and script writers.  It was sad\\, however\\, to see old friends killed off or cast aside as if they weren't valuable anymore -- C3P0\\, R2D2\\, Chewy\\, and Luke.  Those characters actually were well-developed once upon a time - or should I say \\\"A long time ago...\\\"","true":true}
