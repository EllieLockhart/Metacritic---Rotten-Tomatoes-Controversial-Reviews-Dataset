Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The majority of the 1st and 2nd acts are really bad.  Too much unnecessary humor for a real Star Wars movie.  Several scenes that we're straight up terrible.  Way too many plot holes.  3rd act has most of the action and sort of redeems the rest of the movie.  Very disappointed.","true":true}
