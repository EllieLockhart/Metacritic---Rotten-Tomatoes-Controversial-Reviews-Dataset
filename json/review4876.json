Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"cons: Lazy writing \\, horrible character arcs \\, universe breaking failures in logic ( lightspeed) \\, spitting on the original cast\\, filler side-adventure \\, a lack of basic strategical thinking \\, unnecessary comedy \\, snook becoming a useless character \\, this movie's only contribution to the starwars universe is getting rid of the old starwars.\\nPros : Adam Driver's acting \\, BB-8 \\, visuals \\, John Williams \\, Mark Hammil's acting .\\nI left The Force Awakens disappointed \\, i left  The Last Jedi Angry and confused how any writer could say: This is a script worthy of a billion dollar star wars movie.","true":true}
