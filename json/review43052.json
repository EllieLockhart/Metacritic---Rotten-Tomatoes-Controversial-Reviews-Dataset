Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was visually appealing and that is all its good for. The scripts are garbage\\, and the actors did their best with what they were given. I was hoping for so much better and the movie copped out with so many characters back stories and roles\\, it was plain sad and frustrating. This move feels pretty much a money grab by Disney and as if they don't care about giving us a genuine star wars movie. I would highly suggest that you don't watch this move hoping to get that real star wars experience. It was probably the worst star wars move of all time. Don't take the real critic ratings as a good rating of this movie.","true":true}
