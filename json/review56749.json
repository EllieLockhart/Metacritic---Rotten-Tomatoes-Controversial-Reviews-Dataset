Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie talked about hope and it basically sapped all hope I had that some character development would take shape in the second installment. The manner in which protagonists and especially the antagonists enter the screen and are quickly killed off was very anti-climactic other than the purple-haired interim head of the Rebellion. I liked that they tried to be humorous but they seem to be unwilling to replace the dry humor of Han Solo. I am still fairly upset that Captain Phasma was seemingly duped at every turn by the janitor-turned-rebel of the First Order\\, Finn. You know she didn't ascend to that rank by being incompetent and for some reason the TFA and TLJ portrayed her as such. Lastly\\, Snoke received about as much attention and a quick death as Phasma did. If Disney's agenda is to generate money from toys after the movie\\, then I ask only this of them - do every Star Wars film as a standalone as you did Rogue One. Do not try to butcher yet another trilogy.","true":true}
