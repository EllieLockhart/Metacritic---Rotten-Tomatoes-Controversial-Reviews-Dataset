Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to start this review by stating\\, first and foremost\\, that I am huge movie fan. I'm also a huge fan of Star Wars - or at least I used to be. \\nUnfortunately\\, The Last Jedi is by far the worst Star Wars movie made to date. There are many reasons for this\\, from lacklustre story writing\\, plot holes\\, unbelievable characters with near non-existent character arcs\\, to being dismissive of the former Star Wars stories and flat out disrespectful to the original characters and ideas.\\nThe Last Jedi is a bland\\, forgettable\\, badly paced disaster and has as much imagination and creativity as the first sequel\\, The Force Awakens.\\nStar Wars fans - or even just plain old movie fans - want a clever\\, well thought out story with emotional highs and lows and with believable characters that we can root for.\\nIs that too much to ask?\\nAnd just to make it clear\\, my negative review of TLJ does not make me a sexist\\, a misogynist\\, a racist\\, anti LGBT\\, or any of the other pejoratives which Disney\/LucasFilm have used to try and deflect the deluge of genuine criticisms that have been directed at their awful sequels by thousands upon thousands of concerned and disappointed Star Wars fans.","true":true}
