Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a middle of a trilogy movie. It's STAR WARS! I loved it as much as someone can love a middle child. There's so much that goes on in the middle of a journey that isn't cool or exciting and it starts at the beginning of the end; it doesn't leave you at the END. It leaves you at the beginning of the end.","true":true}
