Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. Spoiler: this movies is a slow 2 hour chase scene that could have been a couple of minutes. The character development scenes were as as flimsy as the plastic props ( ie Chewy eats a space penguin scene). Then a bunch of pointless scenes are mixed in like when Ren visits the force's hole (?) for no reason\\, or even the end scene with Luke's unexplained... let's just say disappearing. The only character I actually care about (Benicio) was on the same page as the audience; completely apathetic to everything that is happening. This is Jar-Jar bad. Not only is it not in the same league as Episode 7 and Rogue One\\, it's a galaxy far\\, far away from a decent movie.","true":true}
