Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this addition to the series was awesome. It had heart\\, action\\, and depth. I don't get why so many didn't love it. Luke's story could use more details of course\\, but we're also far more demanding than we were back in 1977 and may have unrealistic expectations on what a movie needs to deliver. Movies could never match books for details and it seems like some people are looking for details best found in books as far as backstory goes. This movie challenged our favorite characters. Heroes making critical from the hip heroic choices with real consequences (looking at you Poe). I think the director's direction for the series has effectively passed on the baton to the new characters and they now have a chance to make it their own and  really Star Wars for the next generation. As a side note\\, I read back in the 70s that Lucas said the saga of Star Wars was essentially the story of the 2 droids. That they'd be the only consistent characters through the three trilogies (yes he thought that far ahead then). Kinda an intergalactic Rosencrantz and Guildenstern if you will. As it turns out. that may actually be the way it plays out. Any loved it and will see it again!","true":true}
