Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete abortion of a movie\\, desecration of anything you may have liked about Star Wars and having the producers political views shoved down your throat.  Did not just leave disappointed\\, left angry.","true":true}
