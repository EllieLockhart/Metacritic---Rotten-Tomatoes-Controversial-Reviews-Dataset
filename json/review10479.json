Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great special affects\\, really enjoyed the films but think it is one of the worst of the franchise. Don't like how so many new characters have been brought in 7 and 8 episodes in when there is only one film left? plus how is somebody so good with the force and lightsaber without training?","true":true}
