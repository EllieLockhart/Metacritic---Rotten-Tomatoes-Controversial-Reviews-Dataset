Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"theres a couple of scenes that just didn't work for me\\, but besides that i got the Star Wars movie i was expecting\\, just makes me more exited for the Episode to come\\, i still like TFA a little better\\, and this movie is definitely way better than any of the Prequels\\, it was good to see some of your favorite characters come back\\, as well as have some questions answered\\, of course it was maybe not the answer that most people expected\\, but if it had been everyone would be accusing the movie of being so predictable.","true":true}
