Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"+It was a decent movie. \\n+Some beautiful settings and environments. and a few jaw dropping VFX shots.\\n-I didn't like the story\\, i was never really invested in any of the plot lines or characters for that matter. Some of it seemed underdeveloped and some seemed slapped on just to add filler. \\n-I didn't like the cinematography\\, there was so many missed opportunities\\, to build a emotional response.\\n-I love a few laughs\\, but there was a bit too much slapstick comedy that seemed completely out of place\\, when compared to The Force Awakens. \\n-And then the movie ended on a low point. No real conflict\\, nothing to care about and no real reason to be excited for the next movie. \\n*Overall a decent popcorn blockbuster\\, good entertainment\\, but not something i would recommend.","true":true}
