Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even with a few unexplained things and plot holes\\, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi stops playing safe like Episode VII - The Force Awakens did\\, and becomes one of the most controversial\\, surprising\\, and one of the best Star Wars movies yet.","true":true}
