Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't get over the disrespectful treatment that they do of Luke Skywalker and even Master Yoda. So now we are just supposed to accept that those two basically brought down the Jedi Order temple and secrets? Totally out of character for the ones that we actually followed the series from the beginning. Also the whole subplot of the casino planet was such a waste of screen time and made the movie unnecessary longer. And i am sorry but I still don't feel the chemistry between Rey and Finn and therefore the obsession that he has for her. Oh and how on earth they expect to believe that Rey needs absolute no training to be the biggest kickass on the movies (since she already defeated Kylo with basically zero training). Ugh this movie just frustrates the heck out of me","true":true}
