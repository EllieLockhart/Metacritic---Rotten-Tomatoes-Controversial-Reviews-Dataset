Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whatever the critics are smoking\\, I want some\\, cause whatever it is makes  us believe that world piece is possible\\, Santa Claus is real\\, and  that The Last Jedi is brilliant. There's nothing I can add to what my honest fellow reviewers have already stated. This movie is an insult to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
