Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a fun and entertaining addition to the Star Wars saga. All performances are great\\, some better then others. The dialogue is well executed but at some time it drags a bit and turns a little too cheesy for die-hard fans. The Film calls back to past movies and has many Easter eggs for fans. One problem with the film is that the crew and director try to fit in too much in a matter of 2 and 1\/2 hrs\\, other than that the film is great. STAY AWAY FROM SPOILERS","true":true}
