Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the ray\/kylo\/luke storyline saves this movie from the flaws of the redherring finn storyline. some may give bad reviews due to the vast differences in this movie from that of the original trilogy\\, but overall it is a good and enjoyable work. anyone who says the prequels are better than this is kidding themselves. the acting in this film is light years better than even episode III.
