Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the best - and worst - moments in the Star Wars franchise. On the \\\"light side\\,\\\" we have stunning performances from Adam Driver (Kylo Ren)\\, Daisy Ridley (Rey)\\, and Mark Hamill (Luke); some beautiful cinematography; another amazing John Williams score; and some genuinely tense and surprising moments.\\n\\nOn the \\\"dark side\\\" we have heavy-handed\\, cheap Disney humor; an overabundance or bad CGI effects; a completely tangential and irrelevant side-plot involving Finn and newly-introduced Rose; Poe's clunky \\\"character development\\\"; and a plot that ends almost exactly where it began with many of the questions posed in Force Awakens glossed over or ignored completely.\\n\\nWhat is gut-wrenching about this movie is that aspects of it are really very\\, VERY good. I felt completely drawn in whenever Ridley\\, Driver\\, or Hamill were on-screen and I love many of the new additions to the Jedi lore. The film just totally fails to handle itself with the dignity and weight it needs as the second installment in the series. Instead\\, it seems much more like someone attempted to stuff everything they loved - or had wanted to try - in the Star Wars universe into one movie. There's too much\\, it's too thoughtless\\, and it's a shame this movie wasn't as good as it could have been.","true":true}
