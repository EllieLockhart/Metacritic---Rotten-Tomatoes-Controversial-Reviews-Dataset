Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half of the film was quite slow paced. I found myself having to sit through some rather dull sequences that were attempting to engage me but simply fell flat. As a viewer\\, I don't really care about Po\\, nor the new characters in this film. Finn's storyline in this film was also a bit \\\"meh\\\". And they have killed of the two best characters\\, Snoke and Skywalker.  The film did redeem itself in the second half by pushing up the tension\\, plot twists and action. Although\\, I must say that I disliked the use of a puppet for Yoda. To me\\, it seemed like the director was trying to hard to distance the film from the prequels. In this day and age\\, Who the hell wants to see a fucking puppet on screen?","true":true}
