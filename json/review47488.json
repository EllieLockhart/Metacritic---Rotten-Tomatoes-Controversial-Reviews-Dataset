Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is the difference between The Last Jedi and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets?\\n\\nThey are fundamentally very similar.  Both science fiction fantasies suffer from static characters meandering through uninteresting storylines encumbered by numerous plot holes that are surpassed only by the sheer amount of absolutely stunning visuals that the producers were hoping would be enough to supersede the complete lack of cinematic substance.    \\n\\nOne of these films will be remembered for all time.  The other would be forgotten weeks after its release.  \\n\\nOne of these films made profitable gains after one week.  The other was a financial disaster. \\n \\nOne of them is preceded in its title by Star Wars.  \\n\\nAnd that's the only real difference.","true":true}
