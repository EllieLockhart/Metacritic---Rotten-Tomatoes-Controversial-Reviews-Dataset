Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it had some great ideas and somewhere underneath it all was a good story trying to shine through\\, however the \\\"comedy\\\" was cheesy and over done\\, Leia using the force to return to the shop was just silly\\, the whole Finn and Rose story was a complete waste film\\, it's like the director just wanted to do the opposite of what the audience expected\\, which when done right that can create tension and suspense\\, however when you do it every time it's just falls flat\\, overall I'd say it felt unfinished in some key moments","true":true}
