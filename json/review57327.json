Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not bad because of the way Luke Skywalker is treated or because Disney ruined my childhood. This movie is bad because it is just a mess. \\nThe tone of the movie is all over the place\\, the jokes do not fit at all. There are scenes that lead to nothing\\, in fact the whole Finn sidestory feels like complete filler. Most of the characters end up at the same place they were in the beginning of the movie\\, no development whatsoever. The new characters introduced in this movie are terrible and make terrible decisions throughout their appearances. \\nThe Force Awakens revitalized the Star Wars franchise in a great way\\, setting up a new epic story with interesting characters and questions and the Last Jedi just throws that all out of the video and makes nothing out of it. It is just a shame.","true":true}
