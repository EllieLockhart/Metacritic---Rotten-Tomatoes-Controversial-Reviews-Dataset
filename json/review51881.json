{"101487":99545,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few prefaces:\\n1.  This is the ultimate proof that critics are swayed by major corps to post positive reviews.  Reading through the critic reviews\\, it's extremely apparent that the majority of them didn't watch the film.\\n2. The people who are trying to \\\"balance\\\" the negative reviews are making the argument that disliking the film is not an option.\\n3. Trust me\\, I hate to be giving low ratings alongside people claiming the film has \\\"SJW politics\\\" because they're offended that some characters aren't white or as one reviewer said\\, that it has \\\"feminist women\\\" (and having seen the film\\, I can verify that he just means women in general) but as a life long Star Wars fan\\, I can't give a positive review and still consider myself a fan.\\nHere's why:\\n\\n- Right after the opening crawl\\, the camera pans downwards (as it always does in SW movies) and the camera starts flying through a bunch of ships.  This isn't major and wouldn't matter if the rest of the film was good\\, but the director is already establishing within the first few seconds that he's going to endlessly assault you with CGI.\\n\\n- Next there's a sort of funny dialogue between Poe and Hux which is fine but also a little strange.  At this point they seem to be establishing that the First Order is far beyond the ineptitude of the routine stormtroopers-can't-shoot gags in the older films\\, the director is establishing that the First Order is so ridiculously silly that it makes the Resistance look terrible for ever having lost any lives to them.\\n\\n- Next\\, Poe takes out ALL of the cannons on a dreadnought (I think it was called) with a single ship and without any help.  They're establishing that multiple First Order star destroyers can essentially be defeated by a single x-wing.  Again\\, this makes every battle in the past lose all meaning.\\n\\n- At this point there's a bombing scene.  A bunch of Resistance bombers are destroyed by colliding into each other.  Seriously\\, both factions are looking really ridiculous.  I noticed some reviewers complaining about dropping bombs in space but this has always been a thing in the SW franchise and I'd imagine it's pretty easy to make up some sci-fi reason that it works.\\n\\n- There's a generally strange disconnect in dialogue throughout the start of the movie that gets worse as it continues.  The characters seem out of character.\\n\\n- During the first half hour or so\\, there are a *lot* of characters introduced without reason.  It feels like everyone's OC (original character) got screentime.\\n\\n- There's a lot of humor scenes that are okay\\, they seem to function alright\\, but they're also often at really uncomfortable moments within the plot overall.  The humor seems slightly misplaced\\, like the scene with a porg upset that Chewie is going to eat another porg is fine but also seems more like a cute moment from a Pixar film than Star Wars material.  Again\\, this bit is nitpicky\\, the humor is far better than the dialogue\\, plot\\, etc.\\n\\n- Chewbacca just kind of disappears from the plot randomly.\\n\\n- When Rey reaches the island Luke is living on\\, there's this sea monster thing you see briefly in the water behind Rey.  It stuck out to me.  It wasn't particularly offensive but I remember thinking \\\"was that necessary?\\\" and from then on there was a constant barrage of CGI aliens and creatures that was like the prequels on steroids.\\n\\n- Soon after Luke milks an alien species.  The camera even zooms in on its nipples.  It seems put there entirely to make kids go \\\"eww!\\\" and is roughly on the same level as fart jokes.\\n\\n- On the island Luke is rude to Rey with reason\\, he doesn't want a repeat of Kylo.  This makes sense\\, but he later changes his mind more than once without any reasoning.  He suddenly wants to train her\\, then doesn't\\, then does.\\n\\n- Then he illustrates why the Jedi are bad.  Then he seems to think they're good.  Then he decides to burn tomes of Jedi knowledge.  Then he decides not to.  Then he's glad that they're burned.\\n\\n- Okay\\, at this point in the plot we've been bringing in random characters for no reason and Maz has an uncomfortable cameo for shaky plot reasons\\, she says there's a master code breaker and that they need to recruit him.  Finn and\\, for some reason\\, Rose go to a gambling planet.  The whole place is.. really far from Star Wars aesthetic.  It's this kind of super high fashion Lady Gaga music video.\\n\\n-  By this point you have the strongest feeling that the film is 100% a departure from the aesthetic\\, feeling\\, storytelling\\, etc. of not just prior Star Wars films but even the shows\\, games\\, and everything in the Star Wars universe.\\n\\n- The code breaker is introduced and is a character for like 10 seconds but then doesn't even matter\\, why is he even there?  Why are so many of these characters even there?\\n\\n- Benicio Del Toro shows up and does a really bad job fitting into the Star Wars universe.  He basically plays himself.  They (Finn and Rose) establish that they DO NOT trust him but later they kind of trust him but then he \\\"betrays\\\" them even though nobody thought he was reliable in the first place.\\n\\n- Around this point they randomly establish that the Resistance gets its fighters and weapons from a slave labor planet then just kind of ignore it later..?  What?\\n\\n- Benicio Del Toro's character's entire point is to open a door.  If they'd just had Rose be able to open it herself since she's apparently capable of sabotaging the ship anyway\\, they could have avoided this entire 30+ minutes of wasted plot.\\n\\n- There's a whole blatant allegorical element to the gambling planet and\\, listen\\, I hate oligarchies too\\, but it's really childish.  There's pauper children and a whole side plot with these animals which are kind of like race horses and it doesn't really go anywhere.\\n\\n- The Knights of Ren were completely removed from the backstory.\\n\\n- There's apparently a weird furry hole that is the source of dark energy on the island and Rey falls into it but it's actually not bad\\, there's just some water and a trippy mirror that she sees a bunch of copies of herself in\\, then she's out of the hole later and it never gets explained.\\n\\n- In one of the few good parts of the film\\, Luke reverses the whole midichlorian thing when he explains the force to Rey.\\n\\n- Some of the scenes with Luke \\\"training\\\" Rey were actually fine.\\n\\n- Unfortunately\\, Luke is involved in this line of thinking that the Jedi and Sith are basically the same.  He does a terrible job at explaining it\\, basically saying that the Jedi are vain and the Sith are genocidal.  Are vanity and genocide really on the same level?\\n\\n- At this point\\, the plot is completely derailed.  Some positive reviewers here use the word \\\"unpredictable\\\" as if that's a positive.  There's a difference between a film being predictable or boring and a film making sense.  While it's technically true that the incoherence really is \\\"unpredictable\\\" it's also a cop out to list it as a positive.\\n\\n- This is a minor criticism\\, but I noticed that around the middle of the film there were a lot of aesthetic choices that seemed way outside of the vibe of Star Wars.  There were a lot of Tron-esque costumes and Star Trek-esque lightspeed effects.\\n\\n- Okay\\, now we get to one of the most common gripes fans have\\, and I'm going to be repeating this criticism later for a couple other characters.  Leia is suddenly\\, randomly a Jedi god.  Not a master\\, a god.  She can fly around in space and knock down doors with her damned mind.  At the end of Return of the Jedi it was established that like Luke\\, she was force sensitive.  This is fine.  Her suddenly expressing more power than Yoda is not.\\n\\n- Snoke's death is weird.  He's apparently super powerful and can sense all your thoughts but can't sense Kylo sneaking a lightsaber next to him and igniting it into his gut.\\n\\n- Yoda shows up and is like yeah fuck the Jedi and burns down a tree of Jedi knowledge and vanishes and it's really weird.  They try to explain this by saying that the force is actually sort of self explanatory which like... then why do people even get training?\\n\\n- Also I'm annoyed that they had to make ghost form literally powerful\\, like ghost Yoda can make lightning attack trees.  It was cooler when Obi-Wan's thing about becoming stronger was ambiguous and could have meant multiple things like that Vader would never really be able to reconcile his death which would ultimately help weaken his emotional wall enough for him to care about Luke and defeat Palpatine.  But Rian Johnson was like\\, nope\\, ghost Jedi can control the weather.\\n\\n- Laura Dern shows up with purple Hunger Games hair and is a REALLY uncomfortable character.  The actress has a history of roles in films as realistic modern day people (and she really is a magnificent actress)\\, and she comes across like that here.  It feels as awkward as casting Reese Witherspoon or Julia Roberts would have been.\\n\\nPoe stages a weird coup against Laura Dern and then is pretty much instantly foiled\\, seriously the plot does a sharp\\, tight loop here for no reason and everyone forgives him while he's still unconscious.  Like\\, everyone could have died?  Why are people acting like it was cute?\\n\\n- Also there's weirdly few alien species in the Resistance suddenly.  I have no idea what happened to the Mon Calamari.\\n\\n- Okay\\, if even BB droids can operate assault vehicles alone and take down a hallway full of guards\\, why don't they?  Why even have troops?\\n\\n- During the escape from the Resistance flagship\\, they claim that the First Order won't track small vessels.  Why?  In A New Hope a star destroyer tracks even tiny escape pods\\, why has technology gotten worse?\\n\\n- They go to Crait (no\\, not krayt like the dragon) and Rose reveals that she's in love with Finn.  We seriously don't even know her and they've had absolutely zero chemistry up until this point and the scene is really uncomfortable.\\n\\n- The First Order on Crait is even more inept than they'd been throughout the earlier parts of the film.  Kylo throws constant tantrums and they have a massive canon that is almost defeated by a single outdated fighter except Rose prevents that from happening because she now is suddenly and inexplicably in love with Finn and decided she'd rather have the Resistance die if he lives which is pretty weird if you think about it and rudely makes his own choice for him.\\n\\n- There's a fight scene with Kylo and Luke.  Okay\\, we established that Leia is a force god\\, right?  Well Luke is now a Super Saiyan ultra god who can project himself across the galaxy and physically interact with people and he goes Obi-Wan Kenobi style and he's like \\\"if you kill me I'll just get stronger\\\" but then he's like \\\"SIKE that's the wrong number!\\\" and pulls out all the way across the god damned galaxy.\\n\\n- The pauper children were straight out of Oliver Twist and kind of uncomfortable and the film ends with some kid who I can only assume has a terrible cockney accent and is like\\, a chimney sweep or something\\, using a broom as a lightsaber.\\n\\nAnyway\\, at least the prequels are watchable now.","true":true}
