{"101487":154045,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Minor Spoilers)\\nEveryone remembers episode 5. \\\"mine mine mine\\,\\\" whole theater erupts in laughter. What about the adorable ewoks. Wait\\, Han Solo's best friend is a bear that only speaks in growls\\, and somehow everyone understands him. What about that deus ex machina of Luke somehow being able to superman jump out of the carbonite chamber\\, and after only a few days of not training in saber combat\\, he's able to contend with a dark lord of the sith. Not to mention that these elite stormtroopers are getting wrecked by a farm boy and a princess who's probably never held a gun in her life. That completely unnecessary garbage animal in episode 4? Also stupid\\, Vader can now speak to Luke through the force in episode 5? Boba fett a galaxy feared bounty hunter dies on accident? Wait\\, why was Han on the run from Jaba\\, but he decides to hang out on Tatooine?\\n\\nHere's the thing. The reason why professional critics are reviewing the film as phenomenal\\, is because by any standard that any other film is judged by\\, The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens are both exceptionally good. You talk to the ORIGINAL fans\\, the ones who didn't get obsessed with Boba Fett's diary\\, you remember\\, the ones who saw it when it first came up\\, the ones who were around when that shit first came out? They all love the new series. The qualms people have with The Last Jedi are so minuscule relative to how amazing the character development was\\, the complete 180 on beloved characters\\, and the completely new cinematic ground that it broke. We're living in an era where good and evil are blurred\\, and character's with supposedly high statuses\\, are disposed of\\, the way they are in Game of Thrones. We're also living in an era of instant gratification\\, and binge watching. If any questions are unanswered and have to wait until the next episode which comes out in 2 years\\, millennials call it bad writing. Welcome to the new world of cinema. Jokes\\, strong women\\, diversity\\, and characters who don't fulfill destinies and expectations we throw on them aren't fair criticisms. The Last Jedi is not perfect\\, but none of the originals are. Stop being romantic about the past\\, because honestly\\, I'm reading the reviews that non professional critics are writing about the film\\, and it's as if I'm reading reviews done by people who've never been in an English class in their entire lives\\, and it's disgusting.","true":true}
