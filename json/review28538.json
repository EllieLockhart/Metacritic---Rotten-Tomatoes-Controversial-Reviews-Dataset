Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably my least favorite Star Wars. \\nVisually stunning but oh my god what an insult to a franchise\\, especially on Disney's part who had been telling us all that this was going to be better than empire.  \\nI am also sick of people telling me I don't like this movie because I don't want Women lead or diversity. That is so far from the truth it is ridiculous. \\nI don't like the film because the plot is awful\\, I couldn't give a toss about any of the characters and it was ridiculously anti-climatic\\,\\nSeriously is almost a carbon copy of Batman vs Superman\\, which I literally thought could ever happen again.","true":true}
