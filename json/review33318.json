Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Surpassed even \u201cEmpire Strikes Back\u201d as far as I\u2019m concerned. Took everything I knew about Star Wars\u201d and turns it on it\u2019s head. Great twists and pure escapism!","true":true}
