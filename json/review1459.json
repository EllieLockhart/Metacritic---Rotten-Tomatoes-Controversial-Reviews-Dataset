Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan since 1977 I'm going to say this is the best Star Wars since Empire. It's also done what no other SW film has done for me; it made me think. Really think. It's essentially Star Wars\\, but the underlying theme is the hubris of the heroes. They make mistakes\\, contemplate failure and truly learn from the experiences. Luke's arc\\, though unexpected\\, is absolutely perfect with Mark Hamill totally owning it. I don't want to spoil anything\\, but you need to go in with an open mind. It took me a couple of hours of tooth grinding and scab picking to truly realise the genius of this film.","true":true}
