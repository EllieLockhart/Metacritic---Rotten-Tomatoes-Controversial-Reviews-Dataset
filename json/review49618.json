Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. The creators of this movie should be ashamed for this atrocious product. This is\\, without a doubt\\, the worst Star Wars film ever made. Yes\\, I am including the prequels.  Not only does it fail as a Star Wars movie\\, it is also just a bad movie on its own\\, and one of the worst films of 2017.  As a stand alone movie\\, it has a nonsensical script with terrible writing suggestive of simple directorial incompetence and poor storytelling. As a star Wars film\\, it takes what has come before and throws it out the window\\, paying no respect for the world created by 8 previous films.  A real shame. The best that can be hoped for is for this movie to be stricken from canon and slated for a reboot one day.","true":true}
