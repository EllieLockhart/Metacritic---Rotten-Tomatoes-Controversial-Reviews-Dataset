Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie makes zero sense. The ship battle that stretches across the movie is apparently hours while other parts of the movie are days. Yet they all join up at the end at the same time. \\n\\nThe movie takes place after episode VII yet the alliance is in shambles. The republic is gone\\, or merged with the alliance\\, and somehow the First Order took over the entire universe immediately after Starkiller base was destroyed.\\n\\nThe Knights of Ren are nothing\\, never heard from. Mysteries JJ Abrams set up are complete disappointments and Luke's story is a complete betrayal to loyal Star Wars fans who loved the series while you 5-star posers were calling us nerds. This movie is the result of people making a movie who are in no way\\, shape\\, or form passionate about it. Even worse\\, Disney thinks we are such stupid sheep that paying off reviewers will fix the issues. They got our money this time\\, but mark my words\\, episode 9 is going to bomb. And I'll enjoy every second of it.","true":true}
