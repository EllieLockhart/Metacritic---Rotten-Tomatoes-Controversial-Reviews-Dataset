Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Against the near-certain prospect of drawing pissy venom from Star Wars aficionados\\, which I just am not\\, I'm gonna review The Last Jedi as simply just a movie I watched\\, not as some cog in a fantastical legendary machine which for some reason must be viewed as such in a presumptive awe-stricken and oddly hyperjudgmental state of cinematic religious trance. No\\, I'm judging this from a different and equally grandiose\\, grotesque state- that of a film fanatic. Yeah\\, I've seen pretty much all of the Star Wars flicks save for some animated\/ Lego-based shit but that's only coincidence because I have seen pretty much every other movie save for some animated\/ Lego-based shit. A few of those along my path to The Last Jedi were truly exceptional films from a visionary director called Rian Johnson. I'm specifically referring to Brick and Looper. When I think of the way those two films made me feel\\, I can only quote Jake Gyllenhaal who recently\\, most accurately and hilariously\\, used the word \\\"ensorcelled\\\" (Velvet Buzzsaw\\, in-character and unrelated). Why those movies stood out from possibly tens of thousands I have seen\\, I think of the best work by Lynch\\, Cronenberg\\, Fincher\\, one or two other David's and a Stan. Or Stanley\\, not Stan Lee\\, no detraction to that legend who might have been born an old man I think\\, possibly\\, but say... pre-Eyes Wide Shut Kubrick. And not for emulation of style but actually quite the contrary\\, for a unique touch that left a powerful imprint on my psyche; a sort of puzzle clockwork symphony that only a rabid artist can summon into existence. Bearing that\\, I saw Rian Johnson's name attached to a Star Wars billion dollar production and I was intrigued. Totally shocked but interested nonetheless. So fresh eyes watched once. Then again a few months later. Round one: enjoyed it moderately but left unimpressed by what felt like a massive studio-muddled\\, marketed and sterilized waste of a perfectly great director who was reduced to a tiny voice in a teleconference full of greedy pinstriped execs. Basically exactly what I expected\\, but not a masochistic viewing experience\\, there have been far worse and indeed far worse within Star Wars-canon installments\\, more than one or two with Lucas himself at the wheel. Round Two: K\\, here the seams and the woodscrews really started to show. That and something else especially grated on me\\, the casual Star Wars viewer: an incessant sense of pandering to fanatical Star Wars fans whose demand for nostalgia and super-rigid guidelines prevent the series from ever breaking through the tiresome routine- and yet still is never QUITE enough to satisfy a small majority of them who apparently want to see the first two or three films made with new names and a bit more lightsaber action each time. It's glaring from the first moments of every post-1983 episode right up to this one 40 goddamn years later where the same dated musical score and the same fucking 1977 fonts scroll on a diagonal overhead plane to fill you in on exactly where and what you're looking at\\, right before you begin looking at it. Every aspect of it is so preordained that any directorial input from a guy like Johnson gets silenced for the hopes of not alienating the hardcore fans. And even then\\, any special casual Friday takes where the director gets to actually direct\\, get shredded internet-ically with complaints that those moments made the film too dark or they dared to step outside the airtight Star Wars butt hole. I could go on with other issues I take with the world these films exist in\\, like \\\"why do lightsabres appear to carry substantial weight in the 'blade' like a real sword when that beam is clearly made of projected weightless particles and or chemicals\\\"\\, or get deeper and more useless into the science of why spacecraft have what are clearly air intakes\\, which suggests some form of internal combustion\\, or the existence of 'air'\\,  but rest assured\\, the fan community has got some answer to all such questions that are never truly made into sense for the weekend viewer. They would pick apart my words\\, grammar\\, and lack of official knowledge. But that is not the issue here. I mean to offend no one or delegitimize anyone's childhood. Just saying\\, they could have hired J.J. Abrams to do this task. 2 stars not 2.3 or 2.1...","true":true}
