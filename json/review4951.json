Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have been a lot better by changing 2 things;\\n1. When Luke loops up at the two suns (after returning to his body) we see a silhouette of a star destroyer oming towards him. The first order has found him.\\n2. Fuel for spaceships are of two different types; rocket and FTL. Instead of the moronic chase late lasted throughout the film\\, they could have been jumping to diffenert parts of the galaxy\\, fighter pilots being drained of energy like a certain BSG episode........oh would have been cool if Leia died after being being blown out of the bridge and Fin saved the day in his kamakazi run. Could have been improved in lots the ways with a few nips and tucks. Not too late I think. This version should go the watch of the Star Wars holiday special. One last though\\, I don't think Mark Hammil would have signed up for TFA if he could have read the script for TLJ","true":true}
