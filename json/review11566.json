Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible story and no character development. Sidelined and destroyed all the subplots from the previous movie\\, which were all the reasons I wanted to see this one. They didn't even replace those subplots with better ones. I now have exactly zero fucks left to give for Episode 9: The Love Triangle. Half this movie revolves around shitting on the previous one\\, while the other half focuses on destroying the Star Wars franchise. This movie does have beautifully shot scenes\\, though. It's just too bad they weren't pretty enough to cover up all the plot holes.","true":true}
