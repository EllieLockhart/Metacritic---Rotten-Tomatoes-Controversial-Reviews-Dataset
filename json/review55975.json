Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined Luke the character. Confused why TFA ideas were scrapped. Who is Snoke\\, how can he be around during TCW and OT but nothing explained? Doesn't matter anymore. Who is Rey\\, why did Daisy say audience will be touched when we find it? How can someone who has literally no background be so powerful in the force so quickly when Luke was the chosen one's son and it took him years to get a fraction of what Rey can do. She also beats him in a fight. Not once did one lightsaber clashed against another lightsaber in this movie. This is the first Star Wars movie to do this.","true":true}
