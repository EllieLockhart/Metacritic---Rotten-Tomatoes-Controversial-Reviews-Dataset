Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was just one giant discombobulated mess. There was so many wasted subplots in this film\\, I left the theater trying to piece it together\\, asking myself what I just witnessed.  Everything felt like it was building up to something big\\, but in the end it just falls flat on its face without any resolve.\\n\\nAlso\\, one of the biggest lingering questions from TFA was the identity and origins of Snoke\\, the menacing Supreme Leader.  If you're expecting answers about this character\\, you can forget it.  It's as if Rian Johnson just gave everyone the middle finger on this dire question.  That's right\\, some dark and overly mysterious Sith Lord who had the power to influence Kylo Ren was reduced to a milk-cartoon meme.\\n\\nThen there was Rey and Luke.  It's as if there was so much lost character development\\, I'm not surprised Mark Hamil was upset with what they did to his character.  In Return of the Jedi\\, Luke had such charm and confidence\\, but that all seems to be lost in this.  His ultimate fate was no better; such a drag.  Also\\, apparently Rey continues to need no such training to lift hundreds of multi-ton objects because Yoda has a flair for pyromania.  It's as if a bunch of postmodernists came in and said\\, \\\"Anyone can be a Jedi\\, and having midi-chlorians is privileged.\\\"  Let's wipe our butts with the previous films mythology. \\n\\nI'll give 1 1\/2 for at least being original.","true":true}
