Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like this move a lot\\, the direction and cinematography is awesome. I like that they introduce new worlds as I felt the TFA gave me so little to be excited about regarding new planets and settings. \\n\\nThat said\\, the stuff with the force and Luke's arch that people find so upsetting; I'm sorry these are themes that have been being set through the Clone Wars series to Rebels and really the idea that Luke feels the Jedi might be the problem in the universe is completely justified. He choses to die \\\"fighting\\\" Kylo Ren in the way that he does because it alway him to break the cycle of violence that has held his life and his family hostage. I know its not satisfying to not see the space wizard bonk the space baddie on the head at the end but thats been done 1000s of times and maybe we can grow up a little and say the space wizards weren't that great anyway. A franchise thats willing to say that about itself is pretty refreshing.","true":true}
