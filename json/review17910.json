Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has some stunning moments and it has some that are baffling in their inclusion\\, such as the bizarre Leia Poppins scene\\, but overall\\, its a wonderfully satisfying movie. The opening scene with the exchange between General Hux and Poe Dameron is worth the price of admission alone. There are plenty of humourous lines in the movie but there is also a lot of creativity\\, such as the scene under the island where Rey seeks out answers. \\n\\nSome plot movements are not justified by anything of significance\\, such as the aforementioned Rey scene\\, and other parts only exist to allow for cameos such as Maz\\, fun though they might be. I was surprised at how uninventive Canto Bight was\\, but its inclusion was not as redundant as some have suggested - the setup for the tender final shot of the film was worth the time spent there.\\n\\nDespite the flaws in plot and aesthetic\\, and the short shrift certain characters get\\, this was a fun film that refused to take itself too seriously. The unpredictable nature of the film was refreshing after Abrams` fearful\\, conservative approach. It will be difficult to watch the next one after this audacious effort.","true":true}
