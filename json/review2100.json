Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the fans of \\\"Star Wars\\\" grow up\\, I'm glad to say so does the franchise.  \\\"THe Last Jedi\\\" shows a maturation that is welcome. Luckily\\, it also takes a darker\\, more menacing tone.  This will likely tick off those who only want space battles and wize-cracks.  This time we get real meat to the story and hopefully it will separate the \\\"Star  War\\\" film lovers with the average \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie  watcher.","true":true}
