Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Last Jedi took risks\\, it suffered because of them. The Finn and Rose Arc was unnecessary and a waste of time. Making Luke wait 2\/3 of the way through the movie to accept his call to action is a waste of his and ultimately Rey's Character progression. The movie is a good generic Sci-fi film but not a great entry in the Star Wars Saga. A waste of Mark Hamill's talent and a waste of Luke as the character we knew him as. While The movie has it's merits\\, it has too much slap stick comedy and plotholes that make it unsuccessful.  30 mins too long\\, this movie misses the mark after 2 successful entries by Disney. The future looks bleak for Star Wars.","true":true}
