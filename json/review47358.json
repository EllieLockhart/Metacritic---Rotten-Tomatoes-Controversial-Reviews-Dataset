Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said. The audience score speaks for itself. That being said I was so disappointed with this latest edition to Star Wars that I had to give my own rating. What a sorry excuse for story telling. Visuals are nice but there is nothing beyond the superficial.","true":true}
