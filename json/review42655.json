Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was disheartening to watch. I knew Disney would ruin Star Wars the moment I discovered they bought the rights. This movie is filled with plot holes\\, pointless subplots\\, unexplained occurences (shirtless Kylo Ren skyping with Rey???)  and character arcs so flimsy that they leave me little to care about.\\n\\nWhat they did to Luke Skywalker in this movie\\, however\\, is the most unforgiveable thing. I felt like I wasn't even watching the same person on screen.","true":true}
