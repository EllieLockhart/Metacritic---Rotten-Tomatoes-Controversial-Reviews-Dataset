Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was incredible. Every note it hit was perfect. The ending left me feeling empty... and that\u2019s absolutely the point of the game. You can\u2019t complain about the revenge story being jammed down your throat if you\u2019re also angry with the ending. Because if you do it means you didn\u2019t understand the revenge story being told. The importance of the female centric story is immense. Female representation is one of the most important things to me when it comes to emerging narratives\\, and the representation this game provides is monumental. The first two hours of this game left me bawling\\, and there was never a point where i felt comfortable putting down the controller. I constantly felt the need to see what happens next. The visuals are gorgeous\\, the sound design is incredible. But boy howdy\\, that story makes it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
