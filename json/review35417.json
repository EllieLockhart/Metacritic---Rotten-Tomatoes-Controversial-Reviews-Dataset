Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi can be summarized in twenty minutes of screen time or a simple phrase: No one\\, nothing\\, doesn't matter. Essentially\\, no one is important other than Rey and Kylo\\, nothing new happens or a build up of suspicion or suspense turns out to be nothing\\, and in the end Snoke\\, Luke\\, Holdo\\, Leia\\, Phasma\\, DJ\\, Ackbar\\, Rose\\, Finn\\, BB-9\\, Hux\\, etc. are all meaningless to the plot. The entire movie boils down to: Rey is a Jedi\\, Kylo is a bad dude\\, and both are super powerful\\, the end.","true":true}
