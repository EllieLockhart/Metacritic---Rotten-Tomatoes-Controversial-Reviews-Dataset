Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the most pathetic film of all time\\, I new it was going to be terrible going in\\, that\u2019s why I went\\, to laugh at how horrible it was. But even with that mind set\\, it still surprised me. Good god it was not Star Wars at all. It was pure garbage. If you are a true Star Wars fan\\, you will be horrified.","true":true}
