Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi will easily be the most polarizing of all the Star Wars movies. It expands the power and mystery of the Force on screen like the comics and the old EU did. Rey and Kylo's stories are bold and powerful. Carrie Fisher is spectacular in this movie and Mark Hamill delivers on Luke unlike anytime before. While I loved the movie\\, others will be turned off by some storylines\\, some choices by the characters\\, and the answers given to questions that fans have been asking since the Force Awakens. Go into the Last Jedi ready for a ride\\, not knowing where it will go. If you go into it expecting something specific\\, you will be setting yourself up for potential disappointment. The Last Jedi delivers a powerful and emotional journey\\, and a Star Wars that is visually striking and bold in its choices unlike any Star Wars before.","true":true}
