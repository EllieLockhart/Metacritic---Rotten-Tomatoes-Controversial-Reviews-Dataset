Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The corny jokes kill a star seriously its right up there with spaceballs \\,the villains take a half star \\,another half star with a bunch of the other silly things \\, I enjoyed the Force Awakens so much better\\, story was more true to a star wars fan and the cinematography was shot like the classic trilogy . This was like a Micheal Bay film trying to cash in on the STAR WARS name instead of creating a story that would continue the tradition of how influential this movie was and is involved in peoples every day lives. Rental but not a Classic","true":true}
