Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an experience that\u2019s different than previous Star Wars films. It\u2019s originality is something to be praised. Rian Johnson is an amazing writer as well as Director. The story is incredibly complexed and original. It\u2019s one of my personal favorites. It\u2019s a must see!","true":true}
