Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What Disney has done to the franchise is horrible.  They have to be Purposely doing this\\, and its so sad to watch.  it was truly humiliating and insulting to see Mark Hamill's beloved character Luke Skywalker flushed down the disney toilet.  What an absolute shame.  And that was just one of the many terrible things wrong with this moive.  Don't bother ever watching this dumpster fire.","true":true}
