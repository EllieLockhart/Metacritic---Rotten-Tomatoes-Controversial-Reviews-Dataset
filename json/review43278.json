Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disaster...perhaps the worst Star Wars \\\"anything\\\" since the Christmas special\\, which had better acting than this. It was edited poorly\\, and the whole casino part could have been deleted in favor of a better\\, deeper story. Yes it makes total sense for 20 giant ships to keep shooting at the back of a smaller ship for 12 hours\\, god forbid you just encircle it and finish it off in 5 minutes. They ruined Lukes storyline established 40 years ago. This movie should be pulled from theaters and they should remake it completely and pretend this never happened.","true":true}
