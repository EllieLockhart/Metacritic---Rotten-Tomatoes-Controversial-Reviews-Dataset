Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a pretty good movie as its emotional for me especially the Yoda's scene and the last of Luke's with the Force song. But its lack of infomations that need to fill the plot holes of Snoke' past and what happen to The Knight of Rens (aka former apprentices of Luke ). Also there are so much waste of characters like DJ\\, Exercutioner Stormtrooper and Phasma\\, and I didnt see enough action of AT ST. But still I loved it as it brings back the feeling of ANH and TESB that make me emotional.","true":true}
