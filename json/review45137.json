Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately many fans fail to realize the brilliance of Rian's Rashomon sequence and how well written this film actually was. Like the original Star Wars films\\, he pulled this concept directly from Akira Kurasowa. Kurasowa's film Rachomon is the story of a rape and murder told from three different perspectives\\, each with their own view on how the events took place. In The Last Jedi we see Luke confront Ben three times\\, each from a different perspective. The way Luke wanted it to go (if at all)\\, the way Ben felt it went\\, and the last perspective is probably the closest to the truth in my opinion. Either way it was a brilliant way to tie in a well know Kirasowa theme and film. Unfortunately I think too many fans are fooled by the second perspective (of Ben) which simply portrays Luke as the villain (which was likely not the way the events actually transpired). https:\/\/youtu.be\/fDYvG_P3MnU","true":true}
