Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You are all nuts!!! This is a kid\u2019s movie!!! Star Wars is for kids!!! It was fun\\, exciting and a great two hours!!! Anyone who didn\u2019t like this movie needs to relax and enjoy. ","true":true}
