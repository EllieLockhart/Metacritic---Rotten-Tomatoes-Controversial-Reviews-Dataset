Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last Jedi was a very interesting\\, surpriseing and exciting movie which brings a new story to the sci-fi franchise. The actors are amazing such as mark hamill who plays luke skywalker amazingly\\, Rey who is played by Daisy Ridley was by far my favorite character in this film and I was very surprised by the character Poe who was played by Oscar Isaac because I got to see more of him in the film and to get to know him more. There was a character that. I was very surprised who was in the film and I loved when the character was in it but I'm not going to say who it was because of spoiler. The action was so good and definitely one fight was absolutely epic. The story was good but there was apart of the story I didn't like and that was the scenes with Finn and rose because the chemistry of both of them was terrible and it lasted 20 minutes of the film. Now I want to talk about this character and that was leia who played by Carrie fisher who sadly past away she did very well playing leia and it was upsetting seeing her on screen but I coped with it and enjoyed watching her. I really enjoyed this movie and very interested in seeing the next episode of this saga.","true":true}
