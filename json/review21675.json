Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a huge letdown. Plot is sad\\, no energy. Terrible characters. I'm a liberal and this shit went over the edge with the PC crap. Its Star Wars universe guys. I will never like this movie\\, watched it as many times as I could stand. To the critics: Why can't you accept that this is trash? You bashed Phantom Menace and made Lucas give up on Jar Jar.. And now you're telling me this movie is a masterpiece? What a shame. Its the worst Star Wars movie ever. Hands down.","true":true}
