Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fans\\, I enjoyed the movie.  The story was well done and the pace was also good.  At the start\\, I was concerned that some of the humor would linger however the story quickly moved along.  I like the way the film expanded the powers of the Force for the audience.  In some ways it clarified the extent of powers that had been demonstrated in prior films.","true":true}
