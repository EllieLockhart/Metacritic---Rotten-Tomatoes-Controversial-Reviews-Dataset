Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If i could give it zero stars i would worst movie ever ruined the star wars franchise i hate it i have been a fan since 77 not interested in star wars at all now disney ruined it the critics are way off track and dont know what they are talking about just trying to keep their jobs i guess","true":true}
