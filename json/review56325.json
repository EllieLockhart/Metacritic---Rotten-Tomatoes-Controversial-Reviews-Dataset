Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Suffered from obvious corporate interference. Huge let down from Force Awakens\\, which is excellent. The movie was just over 2 and a half hours long yet felt like 3 short\\, crappy movies rolled into one. This left little room for meaningful character development from any of the cast we first met in Force Awakens. Absolutely hated Fin's \\\"love interest\\\"\\, whose character name I don't remember because she was so BORING! I think they spent more time developing her character than any other and it stole time that could have been used to meaningfully develop Luke and Rey's arc. The alien horse chase scene felt very much like the prequels\\, which I hate\\, and in fact that whole planet should have been cut out of the film\\, along with Del Toro's character and his weird\\, distracting fake lisp. \\n\\n1\/10. Would not recommend.","true":true}
