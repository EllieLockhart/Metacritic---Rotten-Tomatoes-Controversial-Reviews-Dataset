Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"cool star wars action sequences\\, build-up to an awesome saber scene\\, but climax\\, and close out were weak...so much potential to take the series somewhere new\\, and they just blew it. I didn't leave the theater in suspense\\, agonizing that I had to wait 2 years to see what happens next...just felt like a blah sequel...and all of the nostalgia is now gone... wasted. I need a wormhole to a parallel dimension where someone else wrote these sequels and took this story a different way...","true":true}
