Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The gift of reboots and 7th sequels has now become it's curse. Audiences are now writing their own imaginings and theories to the point where they can't just sit back and enjoy a movie as it unfolds.\\n\\nTLJ was beautiful visually\\, told a lovely story of good\\, evil and what's between\\, and had tons of surprises...which is what many fanboys hated..because they had already written their own script.","true":true}
