Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars the Last Jedi is plagued with many issues: whether its the horrendous pacing\\, terrible additions to the lore\\, and terrible twists that go nowhere. Rian Johnson's entry into the star wars universe ultimately is about burning things down. The pacing in this movie is all over the place as certain sequences are similar to slamming the breaks on a car. The terrible additions to the lore such as weaponized hyperspace completely break the universe. And the terrible twists included might be unexpected but sadly don't lead to anywhere more interesting.
