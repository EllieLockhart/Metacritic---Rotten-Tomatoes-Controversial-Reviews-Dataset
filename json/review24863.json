Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My father and I are HUGE Star Wars fans. We went to see The Last Jedi yesterday and we both LOVED it. It is full of action with some nice comedic moments to break the tension. It was especially nice to see Carrie Fisher as General Leia one last time. She gave one hell of an awesome final performance.  I'm also glad that they had as sweet reunuion scene between Leia and Luke\\, and that we get to see a little more of Leia's Force powers. As I said\\, I absolutely loved The Last Jedi and cannot wait to see it again.","true":true}
