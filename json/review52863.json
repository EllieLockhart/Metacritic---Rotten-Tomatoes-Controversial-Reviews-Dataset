Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Although it was nice to see a unique story and plot\\, not just a rehash of Episode 5 life Episode 7 was practically a remake of Episode 4. Ultimately I am disappointed by Rey's parentage. I feel the point crticis have been expounding upon\\, that anyone can be the chosen one or anyone can save the galaxy is a good one. \\n\\nHowever Rey's origin do not explain  her incredible power and skills\\, it relegates her to the role of the good guy Marie Sue. She simply does everything needed by the good guys without any build up or development to get there. Had she been of the skywalker lineage her skills and powers could have been explained. The film could have also made \\\"everybodies special\\, not just people from magic bloodlines\\\" point by having the non-force based characters save the day for once. \\n\\nI feel her being a simple \\\"nobody\\\" demeans her character and others. Kylo was trained in the force and from a strong bloodline and therefore his powers were earned. But instead of having a 3 dimensional character who grows past the fact that she is related to a monster and can make her own destiny despite her bloodline; we have this character with inexplicable greateness who is now destined to be the good guy champion just because she is a nobody.","true":true}
