Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes (one story line is a complete dead end\\, and another would have been over in 5mins if they attacked the rebel ship that was out of gas with tie fighters. And this doesn\u2019t even count Rey somehow being a Jedi with no actual training of any kind). Mishandling of both Luke and Leia. If you have any love of the original 3 movies this movie will be a disappointment. ","true":true}
