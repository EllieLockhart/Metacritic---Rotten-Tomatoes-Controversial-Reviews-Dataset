Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The only reason this game is getting higher than a zero is because it looks good for 1 point and Ellie for the other point. Not only did thus game push social political agendas into almost every character trait in a zombie game\\, but the story is trying so hard to be different that it just feels disconnected from the actuaL universe it\u2019s in. Taking what we loved about the first game. Which was the bond between Joel and Ellie\\, and then smashing it with a golf club from this random new character. THEN making me play as the character that i hate that you attempt to force me to like because her dad was killed\\, which didn\u2019t work btw i felt nothing for Abby right after she killed Jessie. Another character i like. Then you make me play as her for 10+ HOURS to get me to think she\u2019s interesting. She\u2019s not. Lev is just a plot device used to extend the story. It\u2019s a joke of a story. The revenge plot is kinda dull. But since it\u2019s Ellie and even I\u2019m here wanting to kill these people for killing the main character of the first game right off the bat. I could let the revenge motive slide. The ending was terrible. Never in my life have i seen a more unsatisfying ending. 25+ hours of story just for Ellie to change her mind. Your game is trash. The only reason these critics have this game such a good rating was because they are media. And if you include all these elements that people can side with. (Lesbian couples\\, trash gender children) they\u2019re gonna want to give it a high score so they aren\u2019t bombed on by the groups that associate with them. I don\u2019t have Abby cause she\u2019s buff or a woman i don\u2019t have lev because he\u2019s trans. I hate them because they are incredibly problematic and the things that they choose to do. I don\u2019t feel anything for either of them. Dina and Jesse were good auditions to the cast. But wait Abby killed him out of nowhere. Thus game builds these relationships then rips them away for the sake of the plot out of nowhere. I enjoyed playing as Ellie. However like half this game is Abby so. Not only will i never play this again because of its terrible story and characters\\, I\u2019ve already returned it and got my refund cause i felt robbed by the whole experience. Please never buy this game. You will be disappointed\u2026 Expand","true":true}
