I couldn't put my controller down for a 12 hour run and I haven't done that since playing Breath of The Wild on the switch. This is the first time I ever reviewed on Meta critic and I usually dont give a **** but I feel like there has to be a better representation of real gamers and not this fake troll campaign. I wish I could give this higher than 10\/10. And no I am not a big supporter of political agendas being shoved down our throats but this game is not big deal on that area anyways.
