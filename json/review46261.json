Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was a fun movie to see but not a well made one\\, humor was overly juvenile and the plot doesn't stand up to basic scrutiny. Big simple physics errors and created some large continuity issues for the existing universe","true":true}
