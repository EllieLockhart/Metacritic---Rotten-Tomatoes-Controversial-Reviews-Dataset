Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible! This was so disappointing! I would definitely not recommend this movie\\, save your money! The story line was so disconnected \\, who is that person? Why is this happening? What??? If you haven't see the previous movie a lot of this made no sense. A movie should stand on its own with a story line that makes sense. This movie does not. Battle scenes that go on and just seem like a rehash from earlier Star Wars movie. It was too long\\, incoherent and stupid. ","true":true}
