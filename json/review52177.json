Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After viewing the film for the first time\\, it makes you sit there and think \\\"What the hell did I just watch?\\\". But it doesn't stop there... No- this film sours even more with time. The more you think about it\\, the more disgusted you get. I honestly cannot think of another film that possesses this ability.","true":true}
