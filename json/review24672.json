Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was enjoyable and overall a nice addition to the Star Wars franchise\\, for now. The movie makes some drastic changes and for Star Wars fans like me\\, they will only tolerable depending on how the ninth movie handles. The Last Jedi can either prove to be a grand stepping stone\\, or a fall from grace as time goes on. ","true":true}
