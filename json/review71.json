Yet after I saw a trusted YouTuber review this game\\, I began to dive into the game history and lore before deciding to give it a try.\r\rYakuza 0 is a game that takes itself seriously\\, while at the same time.... doesn't. It's this odd blend of storytelling\\, character switching\\, stereotyping and vintage landscape that gives this title so much character. Playing as two seemingly unrelated protagonists\\, you will find yourself going \\\"why am I doing this?\\\" only to say \\\"I'm so glad I did that!\\\" As storylines meld and the full reveal rears its face\\, you'll find comedy\\, tragedy\\, heart warming stories and vile acts of society all neaty packaged into a game that's sitting at your fingertips.\r\rI won't pull any punches graphically. This game shows why its a \\\"remaster\\\" of a PS3 release. It's not going to blow you away visually. It's not going to wow you with its environment. At times\\, you might even groan at the camera angle. However\\, Yakuza 0 is one of those games that makes up for it's graphical shortcomings through storytelling and immersion.  How? Here's how!\r\rThere are so many side quests and mini games built into this title\\, they could have pay walled each of them off and sold them separately. Vintage Sega arcade games\\, Bikini girls wrestling\\, Mahjong\\, fishing\\, slot car racing\\, the back door casino room\\, the phone dating service game\\, collecting cards that unlock video pretty women casually posing for the camera\\, batting cages\\, the Hostess Club sim (which makes you lots of cash)\\, dancing at the club\\, and karaoke are just some of the activities you can partake in when you're not buying up businesses\\, beating up thugs or doing various side quests.\r\rThis game isn't a true open world experience and to be honest\\, that's okay. Once you get a sense of the story\\, you begin to identify when you should explore and when you're likely going to be confined into a story arc. While some people want that \\\"always open\\, always free\\\" feel\\, you'll likely find yourself to engrossed in the story to care or too busy making money to notice.\r\rPerhaps one of the strongest downsides to the game IS you need to make money. As the game progresses\\, abilities\\, your character durability and importantly\\, the ability to survive hinge on you making money.  While thousand yen bills are easy to come buy\\, true to the 80s theme\\, inflation is a huge problem. Thus\\, you'll quickly drop 30 million Yen on a single skill and sent to the streets looking for more. Luckily\\, if you grab the Hostess Club and Property Owner side quest \/ mini games when they're presented and run with them\\, you'll soon find yourself at an advantage.\r\rOverall\\, this is a solid title and one of those diamonds in the rough. Though far from polished in a sea of AAA titles praised for graphical perfection and stunning environments\\, Yakuza 0 shows what a title can do when you mix fun\\, story and solid gameplay together while still maintaining a sense of humor.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
