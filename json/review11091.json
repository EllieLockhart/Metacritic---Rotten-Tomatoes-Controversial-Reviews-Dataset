Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hi all. I only registered on this website just to do this review because of how ridiculous the situation is about this movie at the moment. I saw this film yesterday and I am unbiased as I can be and I can tell you that this film and it's director is literally showing the middle finger to SW fans\\, simple as that. Whilst I enjoyed watching some scenes in this film and special effects\/choreography was awesome the plot holes and lore in this film is messed up horrendously. They butchered Luke's character\\, Leia is like powerful \\nimmortal force user ....(something I missed about her ?)\\, Snoke character build up in Force Awakens is just simply wasted and the whole casino scene is a waste of time because of  plot holes which this film is full of .... I'm asking why ? Anyways long story short\\, I enjoyed some parts whilst absolutely hated the others. this film for me is fifty\/fifty which is huge disappointment. Thank you","true":true}
