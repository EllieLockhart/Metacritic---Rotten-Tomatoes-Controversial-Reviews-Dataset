Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm glad I saw this again. The first time I saw this movie I was pretty unsure. Watching it again\\, while there are still some disappointments\\, I think this might be one of the smartest and more complex Star Wars films. I'd give it a A- despite understanding this is one of the more divisive Star Wars films made.","true":true}
