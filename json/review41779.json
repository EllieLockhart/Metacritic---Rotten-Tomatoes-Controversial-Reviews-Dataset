Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is proof that great acting and great effects cannot save a film from a terrible story. \\nSo many moments felt like they happened just to spit in the face of fan theories and be unpredictable. But that resulted in thoroughly unsatisfying answers to questions asked in The Force Awakens. I no longer have any interest in the continuation of this saga. Episode IX could be about dancing ewoks in tutus and it wouldn't make a difference anymore.","true":true}
