Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie made no sense!  An untrained person who can use the force (and not yet a Jedi) is as powerful as the grandson of Darth Vader who was birthed by the force. There was no sensible explanation for Luke to be some old sour hermit how hates Jedis.  I still don\u2019t know what was the point of the movie except to destroy the Star Wars\/force folklore.  Complete incoherent waste of time","true":true}
