Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure how this made it to the big screen. So many plotholes\\, missed opportunities. SJW themes\\, gimmicks\\, and American slang thrown throughout are the real put offs\\, though. This had so much potential. People are going to have a newfound love of the prequels after this trilogy.","true":true}
