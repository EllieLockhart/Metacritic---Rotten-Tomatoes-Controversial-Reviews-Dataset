Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not Star Wars anymore. 1 of my favorite things about star wars was there was \\\"NEVER\\\" any swear words. This movie either ruined star wars or its NOT STAR WARS ANYMORE upon breaking tradition. Now I'm not saying this movie isn't good\\, cause it is a Great movie\\, but just to me \\\"NOT STAR WARS\\\"","true":true}
