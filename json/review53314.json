Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great\\, not excellent. Some of the plot twists were great\\, some were stolen from previous episodes. The master coder was a huge huge waste of time. Seemed to be more fails than successes. Let\u2019s try this and fail. Okay\\, let\u2019s try that\\, fail. For a movie seeking hope\\, it was hard to find. Really disappointed in the reveal of Rae\u2019s parents. I hope that will be a plot twist back to something better than what they revealed. ","true":true}
