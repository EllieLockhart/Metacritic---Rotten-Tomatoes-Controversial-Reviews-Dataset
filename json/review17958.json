Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it's pretty hard for the moviemakers to satisfy 3-4 generations of sw fans.  The movie has many weaks\\, but also a ton of highs. Overall its a very good second part of a reboot trioligy. Einstein once sad: we live in the best of all realities. And this movie is the best of all star wars countinus.","true":true}
