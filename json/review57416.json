Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an insult to the intelligence of Star Wars fans. It completely undoes everything JJ Abrams wonderfully set up in the Force Awakens a movie in which I really enjoyed and was excited to see where the story would go. There are awful character decessions\\, and plot holes Rian Johnson does that make no sense like Leia now being somehow able to float in mid-space this being never set up in any other Star Wars film. There is an entire 30-minute scene with Finn and Rose that entirely could have been cut out that was dull and served no purpose to the plot. The movies only saving grace is the action scenes can be exciting and visually some the planets look beautiful mainly the final planet called Crait.\\n Overall this movie is a complete disappointment after an exciting two-year wait hopefully JJ Abrams can undo the damage that has been done here in the RIse Of Skywalker.","true":true}
