Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This two and half hour movie felt like four hours and that isn't a good thing. And to make matters worse\\, nothing in this movie needed to happen. Almost the entire plot ends in the same place it began.","true":true}
