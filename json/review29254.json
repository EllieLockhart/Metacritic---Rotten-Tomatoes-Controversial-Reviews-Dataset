{"101487":164913,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Review\/rant\\n5\/10\\nFull of dumb useless shit\\, super big letdown\\, makes no sense if you think about what's happening for more than a minute. I talk about the good parts at the end. I will talk about good things at the end.\\nSPOILERS:\\nOk here's a rant. This movie has so many continuity problems and just bold proclamations its literally insane. Let's start with the beginning\\, shall we?\\nSpecific Problems:\\nThe movie starts off telling you that Snoke destroyed the republic\\, is now supreme leader of the galaxy *cough* emperor *cough* and that the resistance is on its last legs. First big problem: how? In the lore for this trilogy the First Order is the last remnants of the original Empire in a quasi-peace with the New republic. The resistance is a SMALL force within the First Order's territory that is secretly funded by the republic. Be nice if the movies told ya this would it? Now could someone tell me how a small crippled remnant can storm an entire galaxy unaware\\, destroy the republic and its military and scrape away the resistance like its nothing? Sure\\, they blew up a few planets with their discount death star\\, well now the entire galaxy should be fucking them in the ass over it\\, not the other way around. Literally how does he control the galaxy? He doesn't have the ability to do so. Its like Cersei in GoT becoming queen. Why is the dowager queen ruling everything now? Fuck you\\, that's why.\\nNot only does he rule the galaxy he apparently conquered it in a span of five minutes because the very next scene is the last one from the Force Awakens! No. Stop it.\\nPo destroys a dreadnought with a single fighter and a few bombers\\, he's also able to disobey his commanding officer and get everyone else in his force to follow him over Leia.\\nNext dumb scene? The command deck of the fleeing rebel ship gets blown up with Leia on it. She's flying out in space and then uses the force to literally fly back and knock on the ships door to get back in. What? And it looks retarded too\\, just in case you were wondering.\\nSome random woman is put in charge of the resistance who won't tell anybody her plan causing you to think she is either an incompetent idiot or a traitor. Tell people your plan lady! There wouldn't be a mutiny and some other dumb shit so that Finn and another token character could have time and \\\"save\\\" the day when they didn't need to.\\nWhich brings me to Finn and the token whose name is Rose? (idk\\, she is annoying). They learn of a guy that can help the rebels escape from the First Order fleet from the orange old thing in the force awakens who is busy playing live action call of duty. She is literally in a fire fight but feels that its ok for her to just take a call. Why do we need to see this? Why does this stuff happen? This is literally a waste of time that doesn't amount to anything tangible. You lost almost an hour of your life watching some useless shit. Fuck this movie.\\nSnoke dies. We know nothing of him. He supposed to be the main villain. He shows up out of nowhere\\, takes over the galaxy\\, tells you nothing about himself in any of his dialog. And then fucking dies. You didn't need to know anything about the emperor in the original trilogy because at the end of the day he really wasn't the main villain. Vader was\\, he was just the vehicle that progressed the story. In the prequels you do learn some things about him\\, you see his actions as he creates what he wants and destroys what he doesn't. He was a cerebral villain and he was amazing throughout. Snoke just appears for 15 minutes\\, raises about a hundred questions about his character\\, then promptly fucks off. Kool.\\nGeneral Problems:\\nBB-8 is dumb\\, why are we replacing r2d2 with this magic 8 ball that rolls around and can do anything? Toys. That's why.\\nThis mostly goes for the entire trilogy so far\\, its just a remake of the originals with some minor changes and new characters. You understood that the galaxy was controlled by a dictator in the originals and saw how and why they were bad. You saw in the prequels how an overburdened\\, too big to exist\\, inefficient\\, and corrupt system fell and gave way to a tyrannical government. In this you see\\, no you don't\\, you infer? Nope. Your just expected to fucking know that this First Order thing is big and bad and powerful beyond belief for \\\"reasons\\\" and no one wants to do anything about except it Leia.\\nThe jokes. Oh my fucking GOD the jokes. Stop it. Not everything needs to be funny\\, there shouldn't be a har har thrown in during serious scenes or expositions. They feel forced\\, they remove levity to what's happening. Some is ok\\, this was just forced. Get it? Forced? Yeah about as dumb as the jokes in this movie.\\nFinn and token don't matter at all\\, and shouldn't be in the movie.\\nThis trilogy just has nothing to stand on. The prequels had horrible acting\\, god awful effects\\, and terrible writing. But the actual story\\, the political machinations of this psychopath as he bends the galaxy to his will and toys with the mind of Anakin is amazing.\\nThe Originals told the story of how an empire fell and goodness prevailed. Even though the reasons of why X or Y is happening are very much muted in favor of the characters plight\\, its still there. \\nThe sequels? IDK maaan\\, lets just like\\, make the original movies agaaain. I mean we could have so many special effects dude. Don't forget about the jokes maaan\\, pot could be legal soon\\, so we need to get ahead of the junkies and give em something funny.\\nGOOD THINGS:\\nThe actions scenes are on point\\, the acting is great\\, the ending fight and overall tone\/feel are awesome. To bad you had to stumble through 2.5 hours to get to it. \\nLuke in any scene he is in is awesome. His reasons for what he does is the only logical thing that happens in the movie. His character from the originals shine through\\, he's wise\\, but still na\u00efve. The last scenes in the movie to me is perfect. What a great way to send a character off. To bad the director had to put in so many dumb fucking jokes that you know deep down Luke wouldn't do or make.","true":true}
