{"101487":184560,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2020-08-14","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is bad it had so much potentional force awakens was so awesome and this just wrecked the sequel trilogy let me list my reason why first off the luke and rey scene sucked luke just threw the lightsaber how stupid is that the moment people have been waiting for for 2 years ruined then the whole scene is just luke being a big wimp they should've made him like yoda wise like a true jedi no just some wimp that doesn't believe in jedi anymore Second off we have Snoke\\, Snoke was such a wasted character he was supposed to be the palpatine of the sequel trilogy but instead they showed nothing of him at all and he just died from a lightsaber being stabbed in him how stupid is that he should've been the final boss like how they made Palpatine that in the original trilogy finally we have the worst thing about this movie the whole thing with finn and rose\\, rose is a completely useless character that did nothing at all and the whole thing she was doing with finn was sooo boring it was like solo a star wars story which was also boring and bland this whole side thing with finn and rose was completely stupid and had nothing to do with the story like NO ONE CARES this has nothing to do with anything wow they found this random guy that no ones going to remember and now he is a traitor this whole movie is a disappointment to the sequel trilogy ","true":true}
