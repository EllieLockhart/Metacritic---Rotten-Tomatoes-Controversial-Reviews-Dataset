Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars and was genuinely excited to see this movie\\, even after the questionable character development with the new characters introduced in The Force Awakens (which is a totally different conversation). With that said\\, this movie\\, though beautifully directed\\, acted\\, and produced by all involved\\, has destroyed Star Wars for me on multiple levels. As a Star Wars fan\\, I am saying goodbye to this franchise and choosing to instead remember it how it was and not how it currently is. Maybe in 20 or so years we will have a good addition to the Star Wars saga that doesn't destroy everything that came before it. \\n*The 1 star is for the flawless production of this film and pure  workmanship that went in to it","true":true}
