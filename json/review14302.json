Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i got to see a early screening of Star Wars The Last Jedi and oh my god this movie was amazing\\, Rian Johnson did a terrific job with expanding the mythology\\, giving the characters more depth\\, awesome action set pieces and a strory and plot twists that had me on the edge of seat\\, Star Wars is definitely worth seeing more than. once and I can gladly say its one of my favorite Star Wars movies ","true":true}
