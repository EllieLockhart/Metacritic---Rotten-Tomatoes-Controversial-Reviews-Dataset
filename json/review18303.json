Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the story sucked. I thought when Disney abandoned EU it would be to create a new good story. Unfortunately\\, they failed miserably to make a story nearly as exciting as Timothy Zahn's stories.  Two stars are for the music which was great.","true":true}
