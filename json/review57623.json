Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took the characters from Force Awakens and made them much more interesting and fully fleshed out.  No boring scenes at all even with as long as it went.  Those who seem to have missed the significance of Finn's thread of the story didn't get it.  There was a strong theme well portrayed.  As act 2 of the trilogy\\, it ended with our heroes in a very tough place\\, I look forward to part 3 to see how they get out of it.    The stakes in this episode are the highest: the very existence of the Resistance to first order is hanging by a thread the entire time.  Though they can't all agree as to how best to handle it\\, they're all doing their part.  As Yoda says when he explains the movie to you (for about the fourth time\\, it's clearly meant for the widest audience as it explains itself over and over\\, but not in too painful of a way) - failure is the best teacher.  Our heroes learn from their failures and it makes them stronger.  I want to see it again ASAP","true":true}
