Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star for being twice as good as any of the prequels.  It's a travesty what was done to the characters of Luke and Leia and nothing here makes any sense in regards to the overall narrative.  ","true":true}
