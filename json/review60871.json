The fact you play as Abby for about 10 hours is ridiculous. She\u2019s not likable. Not because of the way she looks\\, but because her character is trash. She\u2019s a stone cold killer that they attempt to make you empathize with. I could have dealt with playing as her for 2 hours\\, but around 40 percent of the game is crazy. Her dialogue with Lev is terrible.Story is mediocre\\, gameplay is alright. The fact you play as Abby for about 10 hours is ridiculous. She\u2019s not likable.
