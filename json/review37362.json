Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The positive: \\n\\nThe\\\"new age\\\" Jedi graphics were really good. The fight scenes were definitely cutting edge.\\n\\nThe negative:\\n\\nThe story had holes in it. If I were to use an analogy\\, I would say that it was like taking a domino out of a line and the line discontinuing. There were so many questions that episode 7 created which episode 8 left unanswered that I left the movie completely unsatisfied. And it almost leaves me feeling unenthusiastic about the impending episode 9. \\n\\nThe impact that this movie had on the franchise is kind of like the impact that Quantum Solace had on the James Bond franchise.","true":true}
