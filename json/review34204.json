Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That half a star is for the lightsaber scene and opening scene only. I saw the midnight screening of TLJ and I have never felt more let down by a franchise in my life. The use of Yoda\\, just because he wanted to\\, was more reminiscent of the holiday special than it was of a once great Jedi Master. I don't need to see what hyper space looks like\\, part of Star Wars magic is that we don't have to see it. Leia's Mary Poppins in Space moment was so cringeworthy and a stain on what was such a wonderful performance otherwise. Rae's mirror of Erised moment\\, no thank you and don't even get me started on the casino scene. \\n\\nThere is so much more that is wrong with this film but the worst bit about it all is that Rian Johnson was meant to get it. He made Looper\\, he made Brick but he couldn't make Star Wars. Since when does a Star Wars end with what looks like an advert for a new Star Wars experience and Disneyland (that weird scene with the kid holding the Resistance crest)?\\n\\nIn summary\\, despite the obvious\\, already-mentioned-a-million-times issues this film has\\, no one seems to be pointing out that it didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. Sure\\, it had the names Skywalker\\, Solo\\, Kenobi and Ford mentioned in it but that doesn't make it a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
