Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of action\\, thrills and amazing twists. The Last Jedi is not only a gamechanger for the Star Wars saga\\, is an amazing piece of art. Rian Johnson made a Star Wars movie of his own\\, something this saga needded a lot.","true":true}
