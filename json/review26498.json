Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Odd that the critical score is 90 something\\, yet the audience score is 50 something. Um\\, no. Sounds like a bunch of fanboys didn't get what they wanted so they're throwing a 0 star tantrum\\, as if this was worse than Baby Geniuses 2. This was a fantastically\\, written\\, directed\\, and acted film and a superb addition to the franchise. While TFA seemed recycled\\, this was fresh. The real critics got it right so I'll just leave it at that.","true":true}
