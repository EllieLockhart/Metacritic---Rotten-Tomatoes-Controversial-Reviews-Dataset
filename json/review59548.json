Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I had to submit my review as the user score is completely unjust. Majority of the negativity stems from the rather brutal killing of Joel\\, first part of the game. It was a shock to see\\, but it had such an emotional impact I was totally engrossed in its story and how Ellie would avenge his death. After the events of the first game and the decision that Joel made that subsequently doomed mankind of all hope\\, did people really think he'd be able to continue without any enemies\\, completely unscathed? It's impossible. As much as I love Joel as a character\\, the way the story plays out makes sense and has such weight to it\\, I never felt hard done by in anyway. Abby\\, the character who killed Joel is actually a great character and her reasons are justified. Ellie is no saint\\, even more so further into the game.Overall I think they knocked it out of the park with this. It's just a shame a lot of people that have reviewed negatively aren't mature enough to understand the games direction.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
