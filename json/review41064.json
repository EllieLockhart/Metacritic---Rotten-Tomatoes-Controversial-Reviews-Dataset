Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had absolutely no business being THIS GOOD. It is refreshingly different and new\\, fast and suspenseful\\, and satisfying. Does the new era of Star Wars much justice.\\nTo hell with you\\, fanboys. How dare you trash it. You whined about TFA being a re-hash of Ep3 and now you whine about TLJ not being close enough to the series.","true":true}
