Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the scrolling credits we learn that the Rebels are in tatters and the Empire is busy wiping out what little remains of their forces. Anyone who watched The Force Awakens will be caught off guard by this news. Didn't the last movie end with the \\\"rebels\\\" (who were actually the mainstream government) blowing up the hidden empire base? This whole movie began with a questionable premise that didn't follow logic\\, but that's only the beginning. By the end\\, I found that the greatest achievement of this movie was including a plot hole in every single scene. \\n\\nIt seems that story telling was sacrificed in favor of maximizing visual impact. While critics praised this movie for \\\"breaking the mold\\,\\\" it did so by including the humor that made Guardians of the Galaxy so successful\\, and by bolting on political correctness. To take it further\\, it seems that the inherent morality of the Star Wars universe was completely discarded in favor of politically correct messages. For example: in the original trilogy\\, skill was achieved by hard work. In The Last Jedi\\, our protagonist receives no training\\, and is yet a capable wielder of the force. In a scene that is celebrated by critics\\, it is revealed that our protagonist is the daughter of nobodies who sold her for a dime (upending expectations of some royal lineage). This is lip service! By the end of the movie\\, nothing is achieved by hard work\\, those who are great simply won the genetic lottery (regardless of who their parents were). \\n\\nRather than advancing the plot (it advances in only one meaningful way over the course of 152 minutes) this movie tries to give every viewer something they would like\\, and that is why it fails so spectacularly. As another reviewer put it: \\\"the original Star Wars was built on hero myths\\, westerns\\, religion and samurai movies. The new Star Wars are built on Star Wars.\\\"","true":true}
