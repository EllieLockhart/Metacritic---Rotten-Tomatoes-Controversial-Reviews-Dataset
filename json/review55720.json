Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One viewing is probably not enough to fully appreciate this film. It seemed to rattle past like a  train. Also very choppy\\, cutting between three threads (roughly aligned with Poe\\, Finn\\, Rey). It might have benefited from staying with one story thread for a longer time\\, instead of constantly switching between them.\\n\\nThere were a couple of moments that seemed to be there to explain a plot point clumsily\\, telling instead of showing\\, but they were rare.\\n\\nBut none of these little gripes take away from the essential facts: the journey taken by Rey\\, Luke and Kylo is ultimately brilliantly told\\, incredible performances and full of surprises.\\n\\nThe stories around Poe and Finn were a lot shallower\\, but still entertaining.\\n\\nI felt that much of the film was about deliberately letting the audience experience a slowly building frustration as our heroes struggle to get anywhere\\, making the moments of triumphant progress that much more meaningful.\\n\\nA very different style to The Force Awakens\\, and much less of a conscious homage to the \\\"feel\\\" of Star Wars. There was speculation that The Last Jedi would literally mimic The Empire Strikes Back too closely. Well\\, in one sense it has: a lot of fans hated TESB on its original release and it took years to be accepted for what it is: as a major step forward\\, a risk-taking experiment that had to happen\\, a deeper\\, richer take on characters.","true":true}
