Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie! Maybe my favorite from the whole saga at the same height of ESB. I really liked the way Rian Johnson took risks that pay off. I actually felt like the first time I watched ESB and after a second screening I loved to see children talking about how amazing the movie is. I ENJOYED Star Wars again.","true":true}
