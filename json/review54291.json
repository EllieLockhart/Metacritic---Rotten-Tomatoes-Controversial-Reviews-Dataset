Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess I don't understand why everyone seems to hate this movie I loved it.  I am betting some of the negatives reviews are because it didn't match up with everyone's head cannon of what it \\\"should\\\" be.  I saw it last night and have had time to think about it\\, though I still don't rank it as high as my favorite Star Wars movie Return of the Jedi it was certainly a worthy entry into the Star Wars franchise\\, and certainly far better than the prequels.  I loved the unexpected plot twists with Snoke and Kylo\\, Kylo came out of this a much better villain than in The Force Awakens\\, Adam did a superb job at this character and his development\\, Daisy was a little weak as Rey\\, certainly not as good a performance as she gave in TFA but definitely enjoyable.  I think Mark Hamill hit this one out of the park\\, and I loved the portrayal of a down and out Luke\\, so real and yet such a fabulous rhyme with the original? trilogy's Yoda and Obi-Wan\\, his scenes with Leia\\, and his amazing force feed plot twist at the end was shocking and fabulous all at once. Oh my gosh and the porgs\\, just the right amount of humor and cuteness thrown in. Can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
