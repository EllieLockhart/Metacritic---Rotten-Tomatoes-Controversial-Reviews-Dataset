Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For those who hold fond memories of Previous movies and Star Wars' legacy\\, do not watch this travesty of a \\\"movie.\\\" It is base and sophomoric in its character development\\, but outstanding in destroying characters long cherished by millions of Star Wars fans.","true":true}
