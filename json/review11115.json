Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hi!!!\\n\\nI never made an account here before\\, but I did because it is disgusting what Americans are doing to a work of art. As a South American man I am not familiar with Social Justice warrior agendas or feminist political themes\\, it is not existent where I am from\\, so for you Americans to put that crap inside the movie and not even attempt to place it there subtly was an insult. Latin Americans dont care about your partisan politics\\, we want to see a good movie\\, a work of art\\, and the feminist men hating Kathleen Kennedy and her Beta male social justice warrior self loathing white man Rian Johnson destroyed a work of art. You know who else destroys works of art? ISIS\\, you people are no better than ISIS\\, a bunch of privileged culture destroyers. Funny how you add anti-capitalist elements in the film when you people profit from capitalism\\, Disney is the epitome of capitalism yet they try everything to destroy it. It is an absolute epitome of mental illness. \\n\\nEverybody hates these movies\\, blacks\\, whites\\, Mestizos\\, Indians\\, Chinese\\, they all have the same feelings I have\\, you destroyed the Star wars Lore\\, you destroyed the essence of Star wars\\, stop assuming only white males hated it\\, I am not white\\, and I despised it just like many other non-white males. Even females hated it. Stop destroying a cultural medium of unity\\, Star Wars brings all of us together\\, to have our minds traverse a galaxy far far away\\, we dont need to be reminded of  yanks PC politics\\, okay? Star Wars is dead\\, unless you erase it from cannon\\, the next movie will bomb.","true":true}
