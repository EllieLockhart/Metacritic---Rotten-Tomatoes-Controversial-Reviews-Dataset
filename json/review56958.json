Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie in the entire saga\\, completely inconsequitial. A better title would be: Star Wars: Search for a Gas Station.\\nThe director completely ignored everything that worked with Force Awakens\\, making silly jokes all the time or killin-off characters.\\n\\nSpoiler section:\\n\\nSnoke is dead. A stupid death. A bad written death. It feels like the director did not like the character and just killed him.\\nThe reason for Luke exile was stupid.\\nThey killed admiral Ackbar off-screen and created a new general out of the blue. How using the ship to hit another ship not the plan A all along?\\nLuke and Kylo fight was stupid. \\nLUKE SKYWALKER IS DEAD. He just gave up living. A worst death than Padm\u00e9's.\\n Leia can fly through space now\\, and not die in space. Leia does absolutely nothing.\\nWhere was Lando???\\nThe cassino planet scenes were all a waste of time. I wanted to sleep\\, but had hopes it would get better.\\nI'm really scared for the future of the franchise.","true":true}
