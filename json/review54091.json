Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I estimated that between toys\\, costumes\\, clothing\\, decor and tickets\\, I have spent thousands of dollars on Star Wars.\\n\\nI have spent even more on Disney vacations over the course of my adult life.  My family of 4 makes at least 2 annual trips to Disney World.  We stay in Disney hotels\\, eat at their restaurants\\, go to the theme parks and buy their souvenirs.\\n\\nI estimate that I easily spend over $6\\,000 a year on Disney.  Not this year.  I am so disgusted with this movie and with Disney for making it that we are NOT going to Orlando for spring break.  For the 1st time in 12 years\\, my family will not be among the hordes at Magic Kingdom and instead will be going to 6 Flags - San Antonio.\\n\\nDisney\\, your appeal is gone.  I cannot stomach giving you any more of my hard-earned money after what you did to the fans who actually care about these characters and movies.","true":true}
