Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely out of sync with not only the force awakens but the entire previous saga. On its own as a standalone movie you could give it plenty of credits. But as part of a saga it's disjointed\\, incoherent and a poor and ingenuine attempt to maintain continuity.","true":true}
