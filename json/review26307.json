Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the movie I was expecting but far better than I could have imagined. This was like a thinking man's Star Wars questioning the force and the cyclic nature of it. I agree some of the humor is out of place and some of the subplots don't pay off\\, but overall the movie is layered and surprisingly smart. ","true":true}
