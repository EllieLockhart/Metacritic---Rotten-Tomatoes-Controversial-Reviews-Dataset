Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi: The Tremendous Letdown\\\"\\nMuch like the space it is set in\\, the movie has a few solid points surrounded by vast expanses of emptiness. The movie might have only been worse with the introduction of Jar Jar... and then only slightly.","true":true}
