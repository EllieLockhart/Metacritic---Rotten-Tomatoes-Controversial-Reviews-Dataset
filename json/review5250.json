Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deepest Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. I hear a lot of people saying things like \\\"The force doesn't work like that\\\"!!!! and\/or \\\"Disney has ruined Star Wars\\\" This movie took chances....it expanded the lore. After watching A New Hope we didn't know the Force could move and pick up objects. Empire Strikes back made the Force a super power. Return of the Jedi added Force lightening. The prequels added super speed and super jumps. The Last Jedi expanded the lore and I really don't see anything wrong with that.","true":true}
