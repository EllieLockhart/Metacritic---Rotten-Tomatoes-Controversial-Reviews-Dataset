Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fell drastically short\\, had so many plot holes and completely vapid moments. Star Wars movies are supposed to be so cool that they sell toys\\, not cater to children. The prequels were slammed for doing this and rightly so\\, and the latter two movies of the Prequels are starting to look pretty good after this.","true":true}
