Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move is justified in its long run time. Where The Force Awakens felt rushed and at times far too shallow\\, this movie is much more thought out. Where the last movie felt like a recycled New Hope\\, this is fresh and new in a way I did not expect. I was pleasantly surprised by many points of the plot and was genuinely in suspense in a way that I was not during TFA.","true":true}
