Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is good about this film: The visuals and cinematography. \\nWhat is not good about this film: everything else. I cannot go into detail on this because I've already elaborated in multiple conversations and reviews the reasons why this film is a negation of what's come before. To this end\\, I'll simply address what Yoda says in his only appearance in the film: \\n\\n\\\"The greatest teacher failure is.\\\" \\n\\nWhy doesn't Luke know this lesson already? He already failed in Empire to save his friends in confronting Vader prematurely. Failure is something that Luke knows all too well\\, and he already knows the lesson that failure can help us learn from our experiences in order to come back stronger; he defeated not just Vader but the Emporer by heading Yoda's words the second time in confronting Vader by using the Force for defense\\, not attack as he did in Empire. \\n\\nLuke already knows this lesson concerning failure. \\n\\nThis brings me to my main issue with this film: we've already seen it before. All of it. For all the criticism The Force Awakens received for being a rehashing of A New Hope\\, this one film borrows way too heavily from both Empire and Return of the Jedi; it is simply a condensed version of these two films into one with some Disney spectacle sprinkled for seasoning.","true":true}
