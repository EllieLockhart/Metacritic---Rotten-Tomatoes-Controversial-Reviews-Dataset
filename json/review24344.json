Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(minor spoilers)\\nEverything that was bad about The Force Awakens (and make no mistake\\, TFA was a bad movie) is even worse in The Last Jedi. The story makes no sense\\, the new characters are poorly written\\, and the old characters have been butchered into sad\\, empty reflections of their former selves.\\nThis is especially true with the Skywalker twins\\, with Leia being reduced from a crafty tomboy to a tactically inept geriatric that flagrantly lets her own subordinates die\\, and taking Luke from a spirited\\, optimistic hero to a suicidal hermit who wouldn't lift a finger to save anyone.\\nAt the rate the movies are progressing\\, the next movie's looking to be an absolute trainwreck.","true":true}
