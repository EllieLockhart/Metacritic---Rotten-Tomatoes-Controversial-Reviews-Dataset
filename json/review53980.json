Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is AMAZING\\, the thing about this movie is that it takes bold and incredibly different directions than what Hard-Core fans expect and want\\, this is not a bad thing\\, it actually makes the movie more unique\\, it is not a typical Star Wars movie\\, but it definitely is Star Wars\\, it's action sequences are truly breathtaking and amazing in every way. The movie is far from perfect\\, but it is truly incredible\\, it is a lot to process\\, so it should be watched at least twice\\, each time you watch it you will love it more.","true":true}
