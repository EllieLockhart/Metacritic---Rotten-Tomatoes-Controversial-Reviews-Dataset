Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mediocre at best.\\n\\nSince the begining of the movie\\, when Poe was making fun of the First Order\\, eliminating any respect to them or the threat they represent\\, to the scene where Luke becomes one with the force for no reason at all. It felt empty\\, with a lot of reminiscence from the previous movies. Even the pre-quels worked better around the universe's lore. This movie gave nothing but a bunch of action and popcorn moments. Jesus\\, the hell happened to Snoke? That was the most anticlimatic death ever... Luke's training\\, the fanservice moment when Yoda appears\\, the overall movie felt bland.\\n\\n As a SW fan myself\\, I'm disappointed. So many things wrong here\\, I didn't feel this movie should be a numbered SW entry.\\n\\nThe movie itself was fun to watch\\, but not really what I expected from a SW movie.","true":true}
