Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a Star Wars fan and want nothing but the best for the SW Empire.  So I went to see this film with an open mind.  I don't see many films in 3-D\\, but this was the only one that wasn't sold out the day after Christmas.  I usually scoff at the cheap gimmicks that seem so half-hearted\\, but i will say this film just had some gorgeous visuals that worked well with 3-D.  I also remember leaving the theater having a good time.  *Spoilers* I spoke with my brother on the drive home\\, praising the actual differences in this film compared to the others.  I also bashed the introduction of Vice Admiral Holdo\\, just for a heroic sacrifice.  First off\\, why?  You had a long standing character Admiral Ackbar that was just thrown away.  My brother did make a laughable point; \\\"They probably didn't want to have a suicide attack from someone named Ackbar\\\" that made me chuckle.  But\\, what a huge plot hole.  The suicide looked awesome\\, but wait a minute; firing a ship at light speed can destroy all that?  Why hasn't the original Rebels used auto piloted X-Wings or something similar to do this already?  Seems like\\, with even a ship the size of an X-Wing\\, this would work wonders.\\nBut the days that followed\\, I like the film less and less.  We had a huge build up for Luke Skywalker\\, and this film used up a lot of screen time to explain his decisions for giving up on the Jedi.  Yet\\, it fell flat on it's face.  \\nLike many\\, I agree that Kylo Ren is the most interesting character.  Yet\\, his entire story ended up going no where.  It was even mentioned that Kylo took some of Luke's trainees with him\\, which excited me.  Then\\, never mentioned again.  *sigh*\\nSnoke was massively powerful\\, and I was looking forward to finding out where he came from.  He even mentioned knowing that the \\\"Light Side\\\" would produce a balance to Kylo Ren\\, so I also wanted to know who Snoke's counterpart would be\\, hoping it not to be Luke.  But nope\\, killed him off real easy\\, and now no hope to find out his back story.\\nPo had a pretty minor story to go through.  Finn had a very uninteresting story.  No interesting growth for Rey\\, in my opinion.  The whole \\\"Gray-area\\\" I was really looking forward to\\, as we sampled in Rogue One\\, was also flat.  \\nThe New Order still seems like a cardboard cut-out of a villainous group.  Can't we see what their goal is\\, or how they actually affect the entire Galaxy?  There has to be some good they are doing in the absence of the Republic.   \\nThe Force and history of the Jedi looked like they are done with\\, falling way flat of what my imagination has made up from decades of Star Wars material. \\nYes\\, a higher quality stand alone film than any of the prequels in my opinion\\, but still leaves me little hope for the entire franchise.\\nI was hoping to see a little more umph from General Hux\\, but it seems now he is just an angry child now that he is just side-by-side with Kylo Ren now.  Fun to look at\\, but still disappointing for the entire Star Wars universe. \\nOverall\\, the large story and lessons learned are still paper thin\\, and the progression of the personal stories fell flat from expectations.","true":true}
