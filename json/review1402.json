Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sad film washed with political correctness... At the end of the day\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" truly is the last jedi. It is the end of an incredible cast of characters from the original trilogy who's personalities and character arches that were built over the last 30 years were completely butchered. A sad excuse for a movie. I'm sorry Mark\\, I was upset.","true":true}
