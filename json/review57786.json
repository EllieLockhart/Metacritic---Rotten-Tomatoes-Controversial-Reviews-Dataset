Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. But WTF was ROSE ? Why is that character in the movie. It has no point. They have really pissed on Luke. Made him a grumpy old man. THE MAN that brought down the empire to its knees\\, the character ARK that lead him till now ... WHAT HAPPENED TO IT ? ... How is Ray soo good ? She literally had like a week of training ? ... Keep in mind even the best jedi spend years to just be able to use jedi mind tricks\\, yet in previous movie she did it without realizing. It is like a joke. She is just handed everything\\, she does not struggle\\, has no flaws she needs to overcome. If she dies\\, nobody will care\\, because nobody have seen her character evolve. Leia using the force\\, its like a writing team were told what force is from a monkey. Leia didnt use force pull\\, because force sensitivity allows the user to use the force around them. With this new power\\, we will see force users flying soon. Total bullshit\\, they just needed to kill the entire command structure to introduce the idiot purple hair that is the most incompetent commander. Then some people say this movie has been made by feminists\\, Why feminists would make total retarded women commanders ? ... I can understand Ray being a crazy feminists wet dream with over powered abilities and already know everything.","true":true}
