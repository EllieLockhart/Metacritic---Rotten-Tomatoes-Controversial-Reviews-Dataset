Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The frustrating aspect of this film is that it had all the ingredients to be a great film but failed to put them all together. As a great Star Wars fan I left the theater very disappointed. There was no set tone. It tried to be serious yet threw in humor at every serious film. \\n      Some parts were very awkward and either could have been done better or cut from the film entirely. It is wrong to rate this film next to empire. It is more suited to be rated next to Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
