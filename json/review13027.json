Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't get the hate. I liked thus movie. I don't think it's as good as \\\"the empire strikes back\\\" and it's a bit too long\\, but I enjoyed it. It's a solid entry in the franchise with some decent twists and good performances from everyone. It answered our questions from \\\"the he force awakens\\\" -- maybe not to everyone's liking but there were answers.","true":true}
