Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With ample opportunity for interesting twists and turns\\, 'The Last Jedi' went the wrong direction\\, or just floundered\\, at nearly every opportunity. Some good scenes\\, some ok performances\\, but nothing special. If it wasn't for the critics overhyping this movie\\, the reaction may have been better. And no\\, you never burn all the ancient wisdom because a single feisty girl maybe knows some stuff. Anti wisdom from a formerly wise character; no thanks.","true":true}
