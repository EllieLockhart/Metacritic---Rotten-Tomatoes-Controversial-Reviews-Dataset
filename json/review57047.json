Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is for the true fans of Star Wars.  Not those white middle aged men who idolized their white male heroes in their white male-centric stories.  But the fans who see that Star Wars is a story about an entire galaxy! Let alone multiple races!\\n\\nIf you are clinging onto your white ale pride like the last shrivelled weiner at your dad's barbecue wondering why you can't find a bun to shove it in\\, then you won't enjoy this movie. \\nIf you are not\\, then strap in and enjoy because The Last Jedi IS in clusive and it's beautiful for it.   Thank god that Hollywood is accepting SJW beliefs and recognizing the talent and that representation IS crucial to validity amongst minorities. And they aren't such minorities anymore. \\n\\nStar Wars is as political as you want to make it.  For some they will see the worst of inclusive propaganda.  For others they will see the opening up of the galaxy to black\\, hispanic\\, asian and female actors. That Star Wars truly is for everyone. \\n\\nFor everyone else - you will see a visually spectacular film\\, with nostalgic nods to the original trilogy but a fresh new cast to lightspeed it ahead into modern sensibilities.","true":true}
