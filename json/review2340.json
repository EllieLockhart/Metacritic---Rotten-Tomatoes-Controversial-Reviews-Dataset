Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly terrible film that throws away all the characters and story that came before it. While not a fan of the prequels\\, I find it terribly disrespectful that Lucas was cut out of the creative process that originated this franchise. With him out of the loop\\, the final product feels like fan-fiction written by people who aren't fans of the series. In the end\\, all the viewer is left with is a hack script with simple characters\\, meaningless side stories\\, unrealistic character arcs\\, pointless plot twists and the untimely and meaningless end of the Skywalker saga.","true":true}
