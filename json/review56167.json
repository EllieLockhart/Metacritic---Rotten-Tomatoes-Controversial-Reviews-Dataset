Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers:\\nThere were some good story segments and some outstanding CGI but the lack of faithfulness to the Star Wars character development or demise was flat for me.  Most of all\\, I hate it when Hollywood tries to inject ill-fitting social or political messages into entertainment even when I agree with those messages. I mean really....profiteers or treatment of other world animals would seem like a petty concern to the everyday Jedi when they themselves are being annihilated. And how did the leaky suit worn by Finn help the story? Was that supposed to be funny?  How did Leah survive floating through the vacuum of space without a spacesuit?  It's like the writers and director ran out of material to fill 2 hours 33 mins.\\nIn the end though\\, the satisfaction of seeing a suicide mission with a Jedi supporter driving at light speed through a First Order star destroyer made up for some of the problem areas.","true":true}
