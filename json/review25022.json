{"101487":155560,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My review will be with spoilers:\\n\\n1) Finn & Rose added nothing to the story. If they were just sitting down\\, having a cup of coffee\\, story would progress the same way and rebels would lose fewer ships. \\n\\n2) Rebels\\, they are rebels NOT storm-troopers. I do not understand or respect the Holdo's decision to not share plans. WTF were you expecting \\\"Rebels\\\" to do if not rebel? Why are we changing rebellion into more of a military activity. I thought rebels got together to fight injustice and evil not because they are forced to do so... \\n\\n3) Luke Skywalker is a character who saw good in Darth Vader who always seemed like a character who has no conscience. Opposite\\, we have Ben Solo who is unbalanced\\, questioning orders\\, having doubts and emotional breakdowns left right and center however\\, Luke's reaction is to kill him in his sleep like an assassin? Explanations and reasoning for Luke's choices to become a hermit was not good. Did not satisfy me. I am not trying to be a strong advocate for mighty luke. I am just saying X years missing from Luke chapter and story does not fit well considering where we left Luke in SW 6. \\n\\n4) I am just confused about Snoke. You killed him\\, dont bring him back just give us some info on where was this guy for so long and what was he doing. We know absolutely nothing significant about him and he impacted the movie storyline so much. You got to help us understand.\\n\\n5) Poe\\, Finn and Rose felt like written after the fact. Poe had character growth but made little impact on story\\, Finn and Rose had no impact. I think writers were so interested in surprising the audience\\, they forget to look at big picture and tie the story. \\n\\n6) I got 0 problem with Ray's parentage. HOWEVER\\, we changed the rules of force use so drastically\\, it really now has a little point on educating yourself on force. It use to be that under stress\\, force manifests which is great. Now\\, as seen from the kid with the broom\\, it is a binary element. You have it and can use it or not. Where did that element of discipline\\, dedication\\, time\\, wisdom etc. etc. gone?   \\n\\n7) I would appreciate the \\\"force projection\\\" more if Luke was current age and using green lightsaber. That killed the \\\"hey surprise\\, I am not actually there\\\" \\n\\n8) What's up with First Order creating a silly chase scene... Why cant one of the capital ship travel around in lightspeed to cut them off? Speaking of speed\\, I dont get the idea of \\\"hey\\, we can travel up to lightspeed or very slow...\\\" I dont really get how it is either 50 or 200 but nothing in between... I mean they want to create a timeline and tension FINE but you should find a better way... \\n\\n9) I get the force awakens. it was a repeat but I get it. I get that Ray was under stress and force potential helped her repel kylo ren etc. Last Jedi\\, I dont get. We are basically starting Ray as a jedi knight level. I would have want her to train\\, try\\, fail\\, succeed and experience growth. We are having big baddie who shook the new republic\\, new jedi and previous saga hero down to nothing. Undid all it was done before and he looks really powerful\\, old etc etc etc but where was he 30 years ago? What made him come now? \\n\\n10) element of economy and weapons trade added a new view which is interesting HOWEVER\\, not enough. If the point of Last Jedi was\\, \\\"hey\\, forget about good vs evil\\, think about everything being gray\\\" well that is kinda against everything SW movies have been about. Was Rian criticizing capitalism or was he trying to blur the lines of \\\"good\/bad\\\" I just dont understand it and if you are gonna show that you might as well add some more meat to it... \\n\\nI can go on forever. I just think it was not a good script. Can we forget this ever happened and re-make episode 8 from scratch please?","true":true}
