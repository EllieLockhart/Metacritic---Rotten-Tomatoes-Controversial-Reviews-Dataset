Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something didn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m sure the actress that plays Rose Tico is a lovely person but her character was really annoying. No character development. ","true":true}
