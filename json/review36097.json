Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a disappointing mess. Underused characters\\, unexplained powers and abilities\\, inconclusive plot lines\\, awkward humor\\, inconsistent lore\\, characterization and technology\\, avoidable plot points where a whole segment in the movie wouldn't have happened if only one person would have said something in the movie. This movie is only enjoyable if you ignore all of the above.","true":true}
