{"101487":122609,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"FU Rian Jackoff.  FU Kathleen Feminazi.  FU First Order(Disney).  \\n\\nYou treasonous scumbags just killed the childhoods and memories of millions of faithful Star Wars fans with this SJW feminist and racist agenda.\\n\\nPlenty of others went into the details of how you dirtbags pulled this off in one film\\, so I won't get into it. I'll use this space to write about something that this movie is severely lacking in order to even qualify as a watchable flick.\\n\\nEvery movie has a climax or an landmark scene that distinguishes the movie.  Action movies\\, Comedies\\, Dramas\\, Horror movies\\, Adventure flicks\\, even kid movies always have them.  I'll explain.  A climax is where something profound takes place.  This could be an intense action scene with lots of special effects where the good guys and bad guys fight (Any action flick).  It could be where the detective discovers who the real killer is (Every crime movie).  It could be where the happy character realizes that sadness plays an important role (Inside Out).  Finding out Bruce Willis is a ghost (Sixth Sense).  Every Star Wars movie has a climax or a very memorable\/cool scene.\\n\\nLuke blowing up the Death Star with Han's help.\\n\\n\\\"I am your father\\\" in ESB.\\n\\nVader picking up the emperor and throwing him.\\n\\nObi wan flipping over Maul and slicing him in half\\n\\nYoda fighting Dooku \\n\\n\\\"I have the high ground\\\" - Obi wan\\, or Yoda fighting the emperor\\n\\n\\nThe Last Jerkoff did not have a memorable scene\\, or a climax at all.  Luke dodging a lightsaber!!!???  Rey lifting rocks!!!???? Rose sexually molesting Fin!!!???  Where is the climax?????\\n\\nWhen a movie has a good climax\\, I would rewatch movies\\, just to enjoy it again.  I would sometimes pop the movie in just to watch certain scenes\\, specifically the climax.  The Last Dumpsterfire has no scenes that make me want to rewatch the movie\\, ever again.\\n\\nSo\\, not only did they betray the entire Star Wars fanbase\\, they made a shit film that has no scenes that even remotely try to be re-watchable.  Rian Jackoff has to be the worst writer\/director on the planet.  JJ is far from perfect.  Force Awakens was not a great Star Wars film\\, but it was not horrible either.  Regardless\\, JJ set Jackoff up with Star Wars on a golden platter.  Jackoff took the golden platter\\, pulled down his pants and shit all over the platter.  He then took the platter around to his feminist sycophantic suckups and fed them his shit off the platter\\, while they smile and enjoy it.  Again\\, FU Rian Jackoff.  FU Kathleen Feminazi.  FU Disney.  You earned this one star rating.  Your 90% critic score is only because Disney paid off the right people.","true":true}
