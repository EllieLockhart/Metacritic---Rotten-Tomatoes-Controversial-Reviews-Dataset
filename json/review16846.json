Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Intelligent\\, provoking\\, and above all else refreshing\\, the Last Jedi expects highly of its mature viewers in challenging what we know\\, while brilliantly expanding on the arcs of Rey and Kylo","true":true}
