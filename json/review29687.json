Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson the director is a genius\\, and improves on the already-superlative standard of Star Wars visuals with a flair unparalleled in modern blockbuster film-making.\\nUnfortunately Rian Johnson the writer\/screenwriter is a no-talent hack\\, an idiot and a pseudo-intellectual buffoon.\\nThe result is a smug\\, joyless mess of a movie that's occasionally interesting to look at but terrible in all other regards.","true":true}
