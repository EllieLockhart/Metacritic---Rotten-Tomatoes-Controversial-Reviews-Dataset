Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give this piece of moving pictures and sound (it does not deserve to be called a \u201cfilm\u201d) ZERO stars. I could talk about the plot holes galore\\, empty characters\\, lack of a hero\u2019s journey\\, pointless plot threads and absolutely misplaced humor all day; but other reviewers have done that. Instead the critical and deadly sin of this film is the blatant disregard by Rian Johnson of the treatment for a trilogy set up in TFA. According to Mark Hamil\\, JJ Abrams set up treatments for a 3 part story to be told in this sequel trilogy. Rian Johnson comes onboard and rips it up and replaces it with this nonsense. It\u2019s a disgrace with regards to the fundamental process of filmmaking\\, never-mind the disregard for the previous 7 Star Wars Episodes. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy need to go. Although I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late. There\u2019s nothing that can be done that can save this series from the absolute disaster that was TLJ. Episode 9 can\u2019t fix the mess of TLJ AND wrap up the whole saga. It\u2019s an impossible feat. Thanks a lot Rian Johnson\\, you\u2019ve killed Star Wars for me. Something the Prequels didn\u2019t even manage to do. ","true":true}
