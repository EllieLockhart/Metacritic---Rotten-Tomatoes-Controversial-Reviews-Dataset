Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People hated on TFA for being too much of a retread\\, and now they hate on this movie for doing something different. This movie was bold enough to go in a new direction and take risks. Ladies and gentlemen\\, if any of you naysayers understood that trilogies have beginnings\\, middles\\, and ends\\, you'd understand that everything going on in TLJ has a reason\\, and when IX comes out you'll be eating some humble pie when you're first in line and go \\\"now I see what happened.\\\" So hands down for me\\, best Star Wars PERIOD.","true":true}
