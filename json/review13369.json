Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed maybe 30% of the movie\\, disappointed by lack of character development\\, plot holes and pointless scenes. Adam Driver did a wonderful job as Kylo. Also no one wants a Kylo Ren \/ Rey love story the director needs to be kept far away from star wars.","true":true}
