Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why do we go to the movies? Entertainment! Say what you want about plot points but this movie had my attention 100% Would I see it again? Hell Yeah! Great movie and I love that the director wasn\u2019t afraid to take some risks and stretch the mold.","true":true}
