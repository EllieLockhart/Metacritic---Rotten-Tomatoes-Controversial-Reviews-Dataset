Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Force Awakens left me wanting more\\, this movie just left me wanting The Force Awakens back.  The only reasons i enjoyed this at all were because of the fight scenes\\, and Poe dameron.  Rose\\, a new character they seemed to think was a good idea\\, was a complete burden on the movie.  Rey's story really didn't change enough\\, and since Snoke died\\, it laves you wondering how they will even work out a plot for number 9.  I recommend seeing it\\, not because it is a good movie\\, just so you will be able to understand the next movie\\, which shall hopefully be more impressive","true":true}
