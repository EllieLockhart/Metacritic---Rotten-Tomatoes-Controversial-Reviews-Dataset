Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematography\\, lighting\\, costumes all wonderful. But this film did not preform good in believable character development\\, continuing a story smoothly\\, holding true to established rules from the new cannon\\, answering any questions established prior\\, and giving the audience a real reason to care about any new characters. The story falls flat with M. Night Shyamalan style twists that do not make you believe them. It is obvious that the director wanted to flaunt artistic flair but this flair was shallow and skin deep. If you take this film as an infinities of Star Wars it might be ok but in cannon it is utter trash disregarding everything but it's self. Bringing you incredible landscapes and scenes only to destroy them in order to shock you with lazy writing or cop outs. Plot demands personality changes that are unnatural for characters well established. This film really does just throw away everything you care about worse than Game of Thrones. Though Game of Thrones actually has a cohesive story and arcs most of the time where the last Jedi fails to even do that. . I recommend this film to anyone who want to know if they should bother with Star Wars anymore. The Last Jedi will give you a very loud in your face reason to never touch our beloved Star Wars again. I hope that Disney sees reason soon and changes something to make our Star Wars awesome again.","true":true}
