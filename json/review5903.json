Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. How does Rey\\, with no Jedi training\\, beat Kylo\\, someone trained to fight with a lightsaber since he was young? It makes no sense. And Snoke\\, the supposed evil mastermind behind it all\\, was killed off in the most pathetic way possible. Rey & Finn\\, with barely any training\\, have bested all their battle hardened foes several times already\\, what's left for the last movie?","true":true}
