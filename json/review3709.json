Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than prequels... but a complete mess. Plot is thin. Often unnecessarily convoluted and clunky. Story arcs are ended abruptly. Feels like a stand alone film that ignores most everything star wars.","true":true}
