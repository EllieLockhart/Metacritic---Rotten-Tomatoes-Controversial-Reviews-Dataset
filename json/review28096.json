Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot was riddled with holes that were far too obvious to ignore. The emotional attachments were missing and instead replaced with quick shot action. And for 90% of the film\\, I felt like I was watching the director instead of a movie. \\nIt was the director's work\\, his decisions\\, his ideology. This movie breaks suspension of disbelief to levels I rarely encounter outside of unpublished\\, amateur fantasy novelists\\, where I was watching how witty the author was trying to be and how bold they wanted to be rather than being immersed in the characters they were writing about.\\n\\nRemove Star Wars from the name and remove the hyped fandom reviews. And what you're left with is a mediocre sci-fi flick akin to \\\"Jupitor Ascending\\\".","true":true}
