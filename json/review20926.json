Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was dragged to the cinema for the same reason as the rest of the people: nostalgia. What was my surprise to witness that what only remains of the original saga is that and the main titles from the (archi) famous entrance. The last piece of the saga directed by Rian Johnson explores something like the true destiny and nature of the human kind but trying to revive the key elements that belonged to the first episodes of the saga. I'm not talking about Luke\\, but a lot of whole new elements that will try to connect with a new audience in a need to get hooked on something. And the result is a poor attempt to do it. Some of the actings of the main characters are really annoying and we have to suspend our credibility (which we usually did with pleasure years ago) forced by an unnatural pleasure for the ridiculous. I will not judge Disney's decision to bring Star Wars to life again because all the majors need big productions but they should think a little bit more in the true fans\\, the ones that don't need big super starship battles but also a script consistency too.","true":true}
