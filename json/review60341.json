The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The first game left big shoes to fill and the second game is not worthy to step into them.First of all\\, I'd like to get the easy part out of the way: this game is a technical marvel. The graphics are superb\\, the sound is masterful\\, the acting is next level and beyond. The production value blurs the lines between gaming and cinema\\, but unfortunately\\, the story and characters don't live up to the standards set by the first game\\, nor the incredible technical effort present in this one.Gameplay is much smoother than the original\\, but does not add enough to revolutionize the genre. Level design can feel repetitive\\, even when you're in different areas. The walking and the conversations are nice\\, but they out stay their welcome at times. The game is not difficult\\, and it's about as long as the the average single player games; 25 hours. The story is told from different perspectives to make an obvious point ; conflicts in the form of vengeance may consume people and  outlast them. The main characters are single minded and their negative emotions leave no room for growth or development throughout the journey. They are charged with destructive emotions that ultimately lead them to lose everything\\, making the characters and the player feel empty because of how tragically primitive their world has become. Violence and bloodshed are detailed and magnified in a disturbing manner which only show us how far humans have strayed from values and civilization. Sadly\\, it all makes it a world not worth visiting and the characters do not merit our company.It is a regrettable that the second game couldn't push storytelling like the original did. But it did push the technical aspect and I wish it is enough\\, but it is the one aspect that will be overshadowed by future games with better technology.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
