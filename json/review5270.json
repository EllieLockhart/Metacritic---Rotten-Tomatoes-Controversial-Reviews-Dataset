Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a controversial 'Star Wars' movie that has divided fans of the series\\, possibly the Director's intention. Literally\\, takes the sequel trilogy to a different level; almost going in the opposite direction as to what Abrams did with 'The Force Awakens'\\, which is what the fans wanted to begin with\\, but not at the results they were predicting; possibly the reason why I did enjoy this entry in the series as well. More surprises\\, than answers\\, but possibly has some of the best battle scenes of any of the other movies in the series\\, but also has some of the most bizarre at the same time.","true":true}
