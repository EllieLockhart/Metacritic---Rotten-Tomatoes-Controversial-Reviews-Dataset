Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars movie. The story is rich with many rememberable characters. There are a million twists in the movie which make you wonder how it still stays on the same topic\\, but magically it does. The twists are all also so surprising that it's crazy\\, eventful\\, and edge of your seat cheering.","true":true}
