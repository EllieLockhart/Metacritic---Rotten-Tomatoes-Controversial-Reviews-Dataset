We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Im trying to be neutral\\, first of all as most people know this game is well known because of its father and daughter relationship in the middle of this zombie apocalypse\\, ND did a really good job\\, people expect to be experiencing that kind of story at least\\, they already hype when they see joel in the trailer. But ND decided to kill one of the most important character that they buld ver very hard in the first game. Its ok to kill him but at least make it more heroic. And the way ND force us to play the person who kill joel is a great way to show us a different perspective\\, but for me it is not enough to make me empathize about her. The ending is pretty good although it is not the ending i want\\, if we can see more of ellie and joel relationship in the beginning where it can bring back the father and daughter we have been looking for\\, maybe the ending is going to be more acceptable. To sum it up\\, im just hoping joel death to be good and meaningful and more emotional so it can always attach to our hearts just like when Arthur die in rdr 2. For the rest of it i give it 10000\/10\\, from graphic\\, face motion  capture\\, gameplay\\,  sound\\, environment and the characters development from ellie side.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
