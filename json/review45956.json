Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually beautiful\\, but the story telling was just awful and full of plot holes. If this is the quality of RJ's story telling\\, I will not pay to see his trilogy.","true":true}
