{"101487":167911,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, I\u2019m sitting here two days after I\u2019ve seen The Last Jedi thinking about this low low Audience score of 56%. Now\\, I respect everyone\u2019s opinion and everyone is entitled to their opinion\\, but I believe that the Audience score is very very... surprising\\, to say the least. Now\\, to get a better understanding of everyone\u2019s opinion and an understanding of why the audience score is so low\\, I went through about 10 or so pages of user reviews\\, and I think I understand why people gave the score they did. I\u2019m not in full agreement with the 2 or 1 star ratings\\, definitely not in agreement with the 1\/2 and 0 stars\\, but I understand why people have the score they did. And pretty much the consensus I got while scrolling and reading through user reviews\\, was that the story led to nowhere\\, Luke\u2019s uncharacteristic choices\\, and the casino The story in this film made a lot of people angry for some reason. Whether it be from Rey\u2019s time on the island with Luke\\, The first order chasing down the Resistance\\, or Finn and Roses side plot\\, people had a problem with this story. Now\\, let\u2019s make one thing clear; it does feel like a minor mixture between Empire and Return of the Jedi\\, there\u2019s no denying that. But this film goes in such different directions and has such major twists that I think it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to call it an exact copy and paste of either Empire or episode 6. With that being said\\, there are still problems with the story\\, there\u2019s also no denying that. Especially with Finn and Roses side plot\\, which I\u2019m not going to spoil or give too many details about. But long story short\\, it feels forced and unnecessary\\, and it was all to introduce a character. (Spoiler alert: he\u2019s not in the movie for very long)\\, so it just seems very unnecessary. But other than the 20-30 minutes this arch takes\\, the story\\, I thought\\, was incredible. I really enjoyed how it was as more of a character building story than anything. It was very interesting to see how the characters reacted to the situation they were in\\, it really showed you the mindset they have and how faithful they are to their beliefs. Especially with Poe\u2019s character\\, which thankfully has a much bigger and better role in the story compared to the previous film The Force Awakens. Which brings me to my next point\\, Luke and the other main characters. Now\\, as many of you know if you\u2019ve seen the movie; Luke\u2019s been through some shit. (Spoiler alert for the next few sentences) With him failing at reviving the new Jedi order\\, and with the turn of Ben Solo\\, he\u2019s been through a lot. So\\, with a lot of his decisions throughout the film being somewhat controversial\\, I feel like their justified. Whenever he was so reluctant to train Rey\\, and to revive the Jedi order\\, I feel like his past experience training younglings and past attempts of trying to revive the Jedi council justifies why he was so reluctant to try to do it again. (END SPOILERS) He\u2019s damaged by his past experiences\\, and terrified history will repeat itself and Mark Hamill portrayed that magnificently. Speaking of Mark Hamill\\, my god. This man deserve some sort of award. Or at least a nomination\\, because Hamill steals each scene he\u2019s in even when he shares scenes with\\, the magnificent\\, Daisy Ridley. Whenever these two are on screen together\\, it\u2019s amazing to see two generations of Jedi conversing ideologies and just communicating and interacting in general. Along with great performances is \\,the previously mentioned\\, Daisy Ridley. Who not only gives a stellar performance\\, but also shows she\u2019s more than capable to be the leading gal in this new trilogy (she also deserves some sort of nomination). Oscar Isaac as Poe also gives a great performance\\, and so does John Boyega as Finn. But the definite stand outs are Hamill and Ridley. But on the flip side of this\\, Kelly Marie Tran and Benicia Tel Toros characters\\, Rose and DJ respectively\\, add nothing major to the film. Now\\, the casino is a very divisive part of the film. Either you thought it was a nice addition and was cool to see that they have gambling in the galaxy for some reason\\, or you thought it was completely out of place for this film; I agree with the ladder. It just felt out of place. And the whole \u201canimal abuse\u201d theme that was going on there felt out of place too. Just... everything centered around Finn and Roses plot felt out of place. Now I agree\\, this isn\u2019t a perfect movie. There were some characters that were just wasted\\, and some plot developments that felt like wasted opportunities as well. But there\u2019s no denying that this is a great film. I believe it to be a close second to Empire Strikes Back\\, I know that to other die hard fans that\u2019s a long shot\\, but I absolutely adored this movie. I thought the send offs to certain characters were handled very\\, very\\, very well\\, and all the big reveals and twists were handled just as well. I hate that this movie has such a low audience score\\, but I understand people\u2019s problems with it\\, hence why I gave a 4\/5 stars. Hopefully Episode 9 won\u2019t be as divisive as this one\\, and hopefully it will improve upon all the problems with this film. Until then\\, may the force be with you. Signed\\, GK ","true":true}
