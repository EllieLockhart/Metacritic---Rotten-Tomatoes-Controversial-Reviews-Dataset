{"101487":97636,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About the best I can say about The Last Jedi\\, is that this is not the worst Star Wars film. \\n\\nI wanted it to be good\\, I really did. I was all on board with Disney taking over after the terrible prequels\\, and really liked both The Force Awakens and Rogue One. I went into this one fully expecting to be happy by the time the credits rolled. \\n\\nSadly\\, I left thinking this was a visually stunning missed opportunity. \\nIt seemed like it was a 152 minute-long mission to reset and reimagine a franchise that was just fine the way it was. While I did enjoy the unpredictability of it\\, and was fine with the new characters and new directions the prior to films presented\\, this one went far\\, far out of its way\\, to be different galaxy.\\n\\nRECOMENDATION: Usually\\, I'll go back and see a Star Wars movie a few times and get the DVD the day it comes out\\, but this time I think I'll wait for a used DVD to show up online. My recommendation is to see it at the theater for the visual effects and for the few satisfying moments it has to offer\\, but go into it with a low expectation for the film as a whole. \\n\\nHere's why. (SPOILERS ahead.....)\\n\\nThere are many problems with this movie\\, but the biggest disappointment for me was with the finale of Luke Skywalker's life story. It should have ended with an epic bang but really wound up being a whimper\\, with the focus on wimp. Instead of rushing to his sister's aid to do whatever he could\\, and trying one last time to be an inspiration to the scattered factions of the rebellion\\, he whined and went fishing\\, waiting for the rebel forces to be nearly wiped out before deciding to lift a finger\\, which turned out to be an imaginary finger at that.   \\n\\nGreat Luke\\, if you feel like the Jedi Order should end\\,  then end it while saving the galaxy... honor those before you who stood for something by standing up for something worth dying for-honor those who spent the money to make this a multi-billion dollar property. Ultimately\\, the best you can do is use some Jedi power to Skype yourself to the battle before evaporating into the force? \\n\\nOf course this isn't really Luke's fault. The blame falls on Disney and Director Rian Johnson who used their own version of the Force to make Luke do things he wouldn't normally do. \\n\\nI agree with other reviews about the plot holes and the excruciatingly slow speed chase (why not just warp in front of the rebels like you did in Rogue One?). I was also unhappy with the poor character development\\, go-nowhere side stories\\, and other flaws that shouldn't be there given Disney's resources. Still the biggest and really unforgivable failure of this film is that it deprived Mark Hamill\\, George Lucas\\, Luke Skywalker and every Star Wars fan in the world\\, the ending all of the movies should have led up to.","true":true}
