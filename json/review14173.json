Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were wondering how to destroy a franchise beloved by fans in one single movie\\, then this movie is for you. This movie did what no other movie in the history of movies could not. This movie was so bad\\, I cannot think of a single reason to go back and watch. I checked the time several times over the course of the movie to see how long it had been since the movie began. You would be better just walking out.","true":true}
