Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this film. It was a fun\\, good space opera action flick. But as a Star Wars film\\, it suffers from plot holes\\, missed opportunities\\, and canonical re-writing that just wasn't necessary. I understand needing to do away with extended universe content to clear the way for new writers\\, but in this film\\, they nearly change the essential nature of the Force when Rey completely embraces the dark side and is seemingly unaffected. The power struggle between the light and dark is greatly diminished. A highlight scene of this film is when Luke sits with Rey for her first training session and immediately we see that her character is practically conceptualized as a gray-jedi. That totally changes Lucas' original concept of the struggle of wielding the Force\\, one of the main things that made Star Wars cool in the first place.\\n\\nKilling off Luke would be acceptable\\, except that besides Rey and Kylo\\, there was no character development in this film. Oh\\, and also\\, Snoke was killed pretty simply by Kylo\\, so there's not even a decent bad guy now that we can fear. We've already seen that Rey was able to best Kylo (even after Kylo had been trained since boyhood at the hands of Luke Skywalker) while \\\"sensing\\\" the force for nearly the first time (in TFA). With Snoke and Luke gone\\, Rey is clearly depicted as the most powerful force user in the trilogy at this point (only one way to go -- down). Honestly\\, if Luke was alive\\, I'd be interested in IX. Rey and Kylo do have a good arc going\\, but they can't carry the entire story. Finn's arc was nearly non-existent and unnecessary. If he had died sacrificing himself to save the other resistance fighters\\, his arc could have been somewhat complete\\, but he was saved. Poe was demoted (literally)\\, and the new characters are forgettable.\\n\\nThere were some great moments worthy of the big screen. It just missed the mark in so many areas. I hope that in IX Rey's arc darkens or something\\, otherwise it should be a cakewalk for her. Unless Luke sticks around in spirit form and helps the story along. I really liked Rey in TFA\\, but her development has been so weak that there just nothing interesting about her.\\n\\nJJ Abrams is great though. I don't put it past him and the writers to salvage the pieces. But then again\\, it seems the creative team is taking the greater story into a whole new direction\\, so maybe not.","true":true}
