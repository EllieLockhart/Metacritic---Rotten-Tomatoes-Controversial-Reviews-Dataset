Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. The Prequels put this film to shame. Characters feel completely forced in and unnatural into the Star Wars universe\\, plot points from the previous film are forgotten or answers in a way that makes them feel unimportant and makes you appear stupid for thinking they were. Disrespects the mythos of Star Wars and its original characters\\, and to top it all of\\, the high ups at Lucasfilm continue to insult the original fans for not liking this movie. Basically if you don't like this movie\\, your a man baby\\, a racist\\, an sexist\\, and you live in your parents basement. Do not support the Star Wars IP under the influence of Kathleen Kennedy. Do the exact opposite of what Kylo Ren tells you to do. Let the past live\\, revive it if you have to.","true":true}
