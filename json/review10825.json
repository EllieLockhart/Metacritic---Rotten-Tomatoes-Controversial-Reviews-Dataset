Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"has a scene that provides one of the highest highs of any move (throne room scene) but is not enough to overcome an overstuffed movie with awkward highly politicized plot points. The visuals are breathtaking and there are moments of refreshing innovation but these are taken too far in repeated attempts to subvert expectations and provide far too many gotcha moments that regress the plot. Extremely disappointing mainly due to its clear potential which is flashed through great acting and exciting visuals\\, but utterly let down by a clear left wing agenda driving various loosely attached plot points that greatly detract from the flow of the movie. Not excited at all to see the next installment.","true":true}
