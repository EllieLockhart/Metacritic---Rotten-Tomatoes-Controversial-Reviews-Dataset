Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film with so many plot holes and faults to go into detail (watch angry Joe and the daily uprising as they cover all of the faults)\\, a Hollywood cash grab without the slightest interest in storytelling\\, side missions that don't make the slightest impact on what's going on. It almost feels like the writers and directors didn't even watch the force awakens let alone any other star wars films or literature on the franchises","true":true}
