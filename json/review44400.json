Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many times I shook my head in disbelief and disappointment at stupid parts in the movie. Visually not even close to Rogue One. Wasted time on sub-plots. However plenty of humour and wit\\, good acting from all the leads\\, light sabre duels without flips\\, plenty of character sacrifice. TFA was a better effort.","true":true}
