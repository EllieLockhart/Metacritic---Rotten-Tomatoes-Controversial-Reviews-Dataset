Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is obvious that the director was overwhelmed and drawing blank when it came to finding new and exciting ways to create suspenseful situations. Too many scenes were plagued by the audience crying \\\"why didn't they do that earlier\\\" or \\\"well that was stupid\\\" granted the movie was blessed with jawdropping cinematography and stunning angles\\, it failed to mesh together from one scene to the next. Character development felt rushed and untidy. The theme of the entire movie was left with but two sentences. \\\"Love makes us do very\\, very stupid things and in the future revenge is the only thing that matters.\\\" I gave two stars as there were only two things I found well done. The cinematography and the stage design. The costumes were littered with errors and the script did very little aid the aimless plot of the confused actors. All in all the movie left me feeling frustrated after enduring 2hours and 40 minutes of idiots in power causing the negligible deaths of thousands","true":true}
