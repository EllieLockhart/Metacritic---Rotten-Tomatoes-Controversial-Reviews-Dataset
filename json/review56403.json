Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That was the quickest long movie in a long time. I was not sure what to expect as I heard or read nothing that would constitute a spoiler review or anything to impassioned either way. The reward for the sequestering was amazing. The only thing keeping this from a 5-star were a couple things like some of the little CG rodent character bits that seemed forcibly injected. I get the merchandising and Disney thing\\, but those scenes did nothing for me. There are a few other big things like a huge powerful ruler out of nowhere\\, and leadership keeping plans\\, rationale\\, or intent to themselves for inexplicable reasons. In every respect this movie was superb. I keep thinking that the CG and effects will eventually disappoint but that certainly is not the case with this movie. I get the transitioning out of the old and into the new. And from where I am sitting the future of the franchise is in terrific hands. I cannot wait for the next installment. Beautiful\\, amazing\\, and worthy of repeat visits on the big screen\\, this movie is. ","true":true}
