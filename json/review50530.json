Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star for very pretty visuals and sound and overall stellar production quality.  The story was quite bad\\, and the more I think about it\\, the worse it gets.  As so many others have noted\\, Luke's character was fundamentally changed.  While that doesn't bother me in and of itself\\, the fact that there was no explanation as to how he ended up with such a changed character is bad writing to me.  I am now forced to create my own backstory to try and figure out how Luke changed from episode 6 to Episode 8 - which I cannot do\\, because the change defies my imagination.\\n\\nI also am forced to create my own backstory as to how Leia has such powerful force abilities.  Maybe she trained with Luke\\, maybe she trained with Ashoka or something\\, maybe\\, maybe\\, maybe.  The point is I should not have to create my own backstory to understand why things are happening in chapter 8 of a 9 chapter saga.\\n\\nBesides that\\, I simply didn't enjoy the story.  How much time passed between 7 and 8?  Why are the rebels under attack by the first order\\, and why are they taken off guard such that they couldn't fuel their own fleet?  Since when is fuel an issue in Star Wars?  When did the first order take over the galaxy?  Did the destruction of star killer base do nothing to damage them?  Why\\, after such a stellar victory\\, are the rebels so weak\\, and the first order so powerful?\\n\\nOnce we have all these issues\\, the smaller \\\"nit-picky\\\" things come to light.  Your Mama jokes are stupid\\, why is Poe able to take out all the servo lasers on the dreadnaught with 1 x-wing?  Why are there WWII era bombers in space?  How does 1 damaged tie fighter destroy 3 bombers?  Why aren't all the other star destroyers behind the dreadnaught doing nothing\\, instead of attacking Leia's fleet?  \\n\\nThe very slow chase sequence was stupid to me.  There are dozens of star destroyers behind Snoke's flagship.  Have a few of them jump to hyperspace in front of the rebels and cut them off\\, then blow them up.  If Finn and Rose can take a transport to go play craps\\, why don't they just ferry people off the ship and escape in that manner?\\n\\nThere are so many more points and issues that I have with this movie\\, but they have all been addressed by others\\, in depth.  \\n\\nTo end\\, I simply have no desire to see episode 9 - not due to any boycotting issue\\, but because I have no interest in seeing what happens.  Rey has defeated Kylo twice in two movies\\, she never struggles against him\\, she never struggles with the dark side\\, she overcomes all challenges with ease and apparently without any growth.  Luke is dead\\, Snoke is dead\\, and Rey easily bests Kylo.  So\\, she will simply walk up to him and either redeem him\\, or defeat him\\, without any challenge or any growth - the end.\\n\\nI am very curious to see how Solo and Episode 9 do in light of this movie.  So many people are claiming that the people who like it are paid for by Disney\\, and the people who didn't like it are a small\\, vocal minority.  I think the box office numbers for Solo and Episoda 9 will shed some light on those theories.","true":true}
