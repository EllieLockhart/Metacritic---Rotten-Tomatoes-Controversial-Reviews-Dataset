Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissapointed. The movie didn't match the bsic Star Wars lore. This movie made me question if I should see the next one. \\n\\nLuke Skywalker's character is deplorable. \\n\\nHoldo is on a power trip and creates a situation that gets more Rebel Alliance members killed.\\n\\nRose creates more suffering in the universe. Released animals will be captured the next day\\, also the animal Keepers will be punished\/tortured.\\nRoses selfishness stops Fin from sabotaging the battering ram\\, and consequencely her actions allow more Rebel deaths.\\nPlot holes and Lore holes.\\n\\nMaster code breaker completely useless\\, because Finn and Rose thought a nobody would be better. \\n\\nBy destroying the casino they lost all chances of having the services of the master codebreaker ( which was sympathetic to the cause of the rebellion )\\n\\nNo Character advancement of Leia (and you can't take that back RIP) \\n\\nRose falls in love within 17hrs of meeting Finn\\, endangers Finn's life for a kiss\\,  while advanced ATK \\\"Walkers\\\" sit and watch (did nothing).\\n\\nMajor Darkforce on Island turns out to be useless mirror.\\nJedi training lessons - Lukes Character goes against Yoda's teachings \\\"pass on what you know\\\". Luke's training was intensive- Rae's training is Word Games and \\\"secrete knowledge \\\"","true":true}
