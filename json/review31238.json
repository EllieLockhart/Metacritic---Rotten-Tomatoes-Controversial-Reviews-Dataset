Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many problems\\, Rian tried to create so many twists that he forgot they actually need a satisfying payoff\\, Snoke\\, with so much potential was a joke. Rey is a nobody\\, yet she can beat THE BEST JEDI THATS EVER LIVED in a duel\\, she's possibly the worst character I've ever seen\\, with no development\\, imstantly be good at everything and after 1 LESSON\\, she's a Jedi now apparently. I hated this and everything with the modern political agenda\\, the Casino scene was a farce and I'm done handing Disney my money\\, just so they can dedicate on something so many people hold dear\\, just because they can and people will still come back to watch the next one. I 100% won't be\\, I just don't care anymore","true":true}
