Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke is the worst part. While I do enjoy the performance of Mark Hamill. Luke's character is all wrong. He goes from a man who goes on a mission to the Death Star to redeem his father\\, the second most evil person in the galaxy\\, to a guy who was willing to kill his only nephew and the son of his best friend and sister simply because he sensed a little darkness? Bullshit. Also Snoke's death was underwhelming and unearned. Connecting brain's across the galaxy yet he can't notice a lightsaber rotating on his right hand side. Leia flying like superman through space is dumb as well. Personally these are just a few problems I have and there are loads more. I think the Force Awakens\\, a film I thought nothing much of\\, is better.","true":true}
