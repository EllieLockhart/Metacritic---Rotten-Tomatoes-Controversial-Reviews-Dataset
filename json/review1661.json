Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie it\u0092s good watch but for Star Wars fans\\, this movie is an injustice to the epic characters we know and love. Too many unknowns and the knowns are so underwhelming. I don\u0092t have anything to look forward to the next movie and the buzz is officially dead.","true":true}
