Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While watching this I wasn't sure if I was watching a Star Wars Movie or a reboot of Spaceballs. The comedy in this movie was cheap and totally out of place\\, the tone was far off. I think different can good\\, but only done in a smart and clever way. What I don't understand is Disney's thinking\\, they endorse Rian Johnson\\, are these the type of Star Wars movies we can expect in the future? This felt like a typical Marvel movie. I would curious to know if Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm were totally on board with Luke Skywalker's character in this movie? Or any of the characters for that matter. After Rogue One I gave up on the idea that the spin off movies were going to be thoughtful Star Wars movies. This movie has now tainted the Skywalker Saga\\, For example\\, the way Luke dismisses the light saber was embarrassing and it instantly made me feel different about the ending of The Force Awakens. The first scene with Luke and Rey totally undermined the previous movie. The list of bad decisions in this movie just go on and on. I really hope JJ Abrams can salvage the final film in this trilogy.","true":true}
