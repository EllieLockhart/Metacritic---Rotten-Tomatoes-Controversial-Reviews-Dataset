Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic movie that\\, while flawed in some respects\\, consistently moves the story forward with a great narrative that is pertinent to modern political strife and fits with the cyclical nature of Star Wars.  Don't believe the reviews that say that the characters were inconsistent\\, those people don't understand character development and larger thematic arcs.  It was great to see that the characters in this film were affected by the events of their lives\\, and aren't the cardboard cut-outs that some want them to be.  Finally\\, the reviews section here is awash in obvious bots and broken account links because the alt-right has identified (correctly) that the themes of this movie are in opposition to their movement to re-establish fascism in the Western world.  Don't trust the review average as a result.","true":true}
