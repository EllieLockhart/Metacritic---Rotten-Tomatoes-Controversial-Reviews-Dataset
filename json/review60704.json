We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'm not sure why everyone is hating on this game.  I feel like it is a solid 9.4.  I don't have to agree or disagree with something to enjoy it.  It's entertainment\\, not a life altering experience.\r\rThe game adds to the first game by adding additional movements\\, weapons\\, and minor tweaks.  The only reason I can't give it a higher score is the constant fights get to be monotonous.  Some parts felt way too drawn out.  The first game moved at a nice pace\\, and this game is a much slower pace that gets a little frustrating at times.\r\rAs far as the twists and turns the game took\\, I enjoyed and hated them.  I didn't like seeing Ellie as the bad guy or Abbey as someone I empathized with and actually felt was more \\\"mature\\\" in the game.  There sometimes is no happy ending\\, and The Last of Us Part 2 didn't give us one.  It gave a great insight into forgiveness\\, love\\, bleakness\\, and the failures of being human.\r\rI can only imagine people are upset by Ellie's sexual orientation\\, the death of Joel\\, or the characterization of Ellie in the game.  Who cares if she is a lesbian.  Absolutely non-issue for this game or any game.  I think everyone is bent over Joel dying early on and Ellie is no longer a helpless child\\, but a vengeful adult.\r\rThe game is extremely violent and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  It was uncomfortable in a few parts and I was constantly wanting to make different decisions contrary to Ellie's decisions.  I didn't feel I needed to do that with Abbey.\r\rOverall\\, a really great game and it will stand up as one of the best on the Playstation 4 or any game this generation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
