Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate this movie so much I don't event know where to begin without any spoilers. Let's just say I've banned any movie Rian Johnson is part of in the future. Nothing JJ Abrams setup in the first movie is done any justice. This movie just got fucked with a Rian Johnson dick. There are fan movies better than this.","true":true}
