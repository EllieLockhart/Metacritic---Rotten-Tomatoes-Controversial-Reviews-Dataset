Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why this get a golden tomato?  Should be squashed green tomato!\\nThis was a very bad movie. I like The Force Awakens very\\, very much but this movie is very childish and silly.  I don't care about Rey and Kylo anymore. Luke is dead. So what now? Who cares!","true":true}
