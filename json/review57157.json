Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of my top 5 favorite Star Wars movies. Even though it is not as great as The Force Awakens it is still a great addition to the Star Wars franchise. I loved addition of the new characters. The return of Mark Hamill as the iconic Luke Skywalker was fantastic as well as a nice end to his character. The cinematography was very nicely executed. The writing\\, story\\, and screenplay were all spectacular. The visuals\\, action scenes\\, animatronics\\, and puppets were gorgeous especially BB-8\\, R2-D2\\, Yoda\\, and the Porgs. The costumes\\, makeup\\, and hair were beautiful. I loved all of the new creatures in this one especially the Porgs. The acting was stupendous especially Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill\\, John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran\\, Oscar Isaac\\, Adam Driver\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Anthony Daniels\\, Laura Dern\\, Billie Lourd\\, and Domhnall Gleeson. Frank Oz and Lupita Nyong'o's voice over performances were great. Also John Williams musical score was amazing. R.I.P Carrie Fisher the best Princess ever. A+.","true":true}
