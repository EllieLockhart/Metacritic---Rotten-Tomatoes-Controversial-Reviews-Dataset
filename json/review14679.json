Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been so disappointed by a film. \\n\\nWhat was happening in the middle of that film. Poe\\, Leia\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, a ridiculously long chase scene where two ship just sends the odd blast now and again. Why wouldn't they send out theit fighters and bombard the rebel ship with everything they had. It seemed to me like bond villain stupidity. \\n\\nNot one proper light saber battle in this hole film.\\n\\nWhy kill snoke just why\\, an amazing plot turn but where is the interest now for this 9th installment. These films are playing with the idea tantalisingly of characters flipping from light to dark or vice versa. Even a balance of both is on the table. Great\\, this has happened many times in arcs outside of the movies but they play it like a shock when the character gets close but doesn't change sides. No this is not a shock\\, no character has ever changed unexpectantly in the films. \\n\\nOkay\\, everyone knew there would be a payoff for Luke. This attempt at Luke's change of mind to help the resistance is just plain stupid. Just get in your x-wing and die a proper death. Snoke overpowering Luke and killing him would have been far better.","true":true}
