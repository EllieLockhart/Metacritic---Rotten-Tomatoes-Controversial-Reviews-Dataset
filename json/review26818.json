Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One long space chase because they don't have enough fuel\\, all your hopes for Luke Skywalker to become the Jedi you imagined destroyed along with a wizard of oz \/Mary poppins scene for leia which ripped you out of the emersive fantasy all in all it wasn't the film I hoped for\\, it was ok but just that ok. Disney you shoulld be ashamed there was so much more you could've done to make this movie great.","true":true}
