Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just so I can rate this movie.  Never have I felt so strongly about a movie before that I had the need to post a review. I cannot believe the horrific choices that were made in this film.  If you were a fan of the original three films I would make sure to never see this film as I wish I could scour it from my memory.  The way that the character of Luke is treated is downright criminal.  It is\\, without a doubt in my mind\\, the dumbest main story plot I have seen for a Star Wars movie.  Not only was the plot stupid\\, but there was no logic used in the creation and execution of the storyline.  By the end of the film you are left to wonder where they could possibly go for the next film\\, but more importantly you could care less.\\nDisney has destroyed Star Wars and I will no longer be partaking in any Star Wars movies or merchandise.  Needed to write this review just to put closure on this and warn away anyone who truly loves the original trilogy and Luke Skywalker.  Wish I had driven to the theater myself instead of riding with my friends\\, as I would have walked out of the theater and saved myself from at least an extra hour and a half of pain.  I need to bleach the inside of my eyes after seeing this monstrosity.","true":true}
