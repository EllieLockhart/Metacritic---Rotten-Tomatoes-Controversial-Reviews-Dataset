Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is riddled with plot holes\\, zero character development (characters essentially end up where they started by the end of the film)\\, a string of plot devices that just reek of deus ex machina\\, and the \\\"twists\\\" turn all the mystery and buildup of The Force Awakens (which was its strength considering its similarities to A New Hope) into the punchline of many a flat joke. The twists were cheap and have no depth. They don't change anything about the story\\, other than the fact that things we thought were important actually aren't. The comedy did not fit with the usual goofy nature of Star Wars films and were easily forgettable\\, characters were painfully inconsistent and out of character\\, and there is absolutely no build up for the next film.We ended up exactly where we were at the end of The Force Awakens minus a few characters... sort of. It disregards the lore and mythos of the Star Wars universe\\, and even though it is fiction\\, you need to uphold the rules set up within a story to make it believable. Even though this is Rian Johnson's film\\, it's still a Star Wars film\\, and it felt like anything but. I feel like this just preyed on viewers for shock value and nothing more. \\\"Tricking\\\" the viewers is not good storytelling\\, it's lazy. Very forgettable\\, very messy\\, very poorly executed.","true":true}
