Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All in all great movie. Finn's story arc was impressive\\, we get to see Leia at her best. The development of Luke and Mark Hamill's acting were incredible. I really appreciated the easter eggs and bits that they threw in. 4.5 stars because some of the CG was spotty\\, mostly the porgs\\, but only a half point because of the amazing visuals in the end battle.","true":true}
