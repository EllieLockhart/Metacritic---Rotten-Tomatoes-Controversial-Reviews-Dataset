Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went is with NO expectations.  This is coming from someone who likes the Prequels.  The Last Jedi is OK.  My main problem is not the story\\, but the STUPID slapstick comedy that was used in unnecessary  places.   Example:  Ray telling Kylo to put on a shirt. or the humor on the ATAT during the battle on crayte.  Comedy in places it needed to be serious.  This was not catering to star wars fans or smart 12 year olds like Lucas intended.  it was for the average person whom is not engrossed in the franchise.  To Ryan Johnson\\, even George Lucas learned his lesson after the Jar Jar incident.  This movie as pushed up the Phantom Menace from last on my list.  The Last Jedi has replaced it as the lowest ranked star wars movie.","true":true}
