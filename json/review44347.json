Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"too many plotholes\\n\\nand rey is mary sue\\, never training about force and lightsaber but can beat trained jedi\\, can use force\\, lol bullshit\\nwho is snork\\, he created the first order\\, dont just let him died like that","true":true}
