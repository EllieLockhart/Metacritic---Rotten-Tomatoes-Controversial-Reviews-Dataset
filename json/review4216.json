Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the weakest of any of the Star Wars movies since Attack of the Clones. Nonsensical plot lines are barely sinful when compared to the absolute trashing of Luke Skywalker. From start to finish\\, this movie was cheesy\\, lacked a profound or logical story line\\, and would have been a completely lost cause if not for Daisy Ridley\\, who continues to be a \\\"Rey\\\" of sunshine.","true":true}
