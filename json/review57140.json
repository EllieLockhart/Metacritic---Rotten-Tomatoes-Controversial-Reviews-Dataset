Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not going to go the way you think and that's the best part. Entertaining and many memorable moments. Had some flaws\\, too much forced humor and a slow and disjointed first half. \\n\\nI watched it twice back-to-back. After the first showing I was not sure if I liked it or not. I enjoyed it so much more the second time around. The first time\\, some of the movie's bold choices felt forced and cheesy. The second time\\, these odd moments were less awkward and I was able to appreciate them at their true magnitude. \\n\\nThe acting\\, cinematography\\, and music was in line with the expectations of a Star Wars film. Even the flaws were typical to this franchise.  Curious to see episode 9\\, as it felt more like an end to a trilogy than the middle. In my opinion\\, it rates somewhere in the middle of all the Star Wars movies. If you saw it once and did not like it\\, I strongly recommend watching it again In the end\\, I was entertained and that is what truly matters.","true":true}
