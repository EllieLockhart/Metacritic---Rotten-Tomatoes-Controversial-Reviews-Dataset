Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The professional critics are now completely detached from the real world\\, only writing what Hollywood dictates\\, prising shitty movies like they were masterpieces (like The Last Jedi\\, for example) and vice-versa bashing pretty decent flicks.\\nApart The Last Jedi with its astounding 43% difference between the improbable 91% of freshness and the more credible 48% of audience rating\\, there are now lots of other examples of skewed ratings: Maze Runner The Death Cure (45\/77%)\\, The Greatest Showman (54\/90%)\\, 12 Strong (54\/72%)\\, Den of Thieves (40\/73%)\\, Forever My Girl (21\/92%) which is the one with the most skewed rating with an incredible 71% difference. What's up dudes? \\nDo you really watch the movies before rating them or you simply write what you are told in order to get your money or other benefits from the big studios? Let's talk about conflict of interest VS objectivity.\\nI have read professional critics about The Last Jedi which really let me think you did not watch the movie at all.\\nWhy should a moviegoer trust your judgment anymore? The probability of actually enjoying a movie you rated high is extremely low. We should all do the opposite of what you say. So if you say \\\"go watch it\\\"\\, we should all avoid it like pest.","true":true}
