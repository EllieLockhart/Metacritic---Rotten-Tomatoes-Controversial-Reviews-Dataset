Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing on so many levels. The visuals\\, score\\, acting and costume design are still all amazing but the story itself is empty and bland. The writing is terrible too. Definitely one of the worst Star Wars films to date. I don't recommend it.","true":true}
