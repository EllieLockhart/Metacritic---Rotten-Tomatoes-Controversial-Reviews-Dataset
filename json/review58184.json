Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A despicable film that disregards\\, disdains\\, or actively destroys everything that preceded it\\, including The Force Awakens. \\n\\nRian Johnson's Episode 8 is a smug\\, politicized vanity project that treats TFA as a nuisance and trolls its own audience. How a script this destructive and logically absurd was greenlighted I'll never understand. \\n\\nJohnson mischaracterizes and destroys well-established legacy characters and ignores numerous rich story veins\\, yet builds nothing in return. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi manages to squander every bit of good will\\, excitement\\, and narrative possibility generated by TFA -- killing investment in the current anthology and tainting and undermining both the OT and TFA. \\n\\nThe one star is for the visuals and some of the acting. \\n\\nI wish I could undo having seen this film. It has permanently damaged my relationship with Star Wars.","true":true}
