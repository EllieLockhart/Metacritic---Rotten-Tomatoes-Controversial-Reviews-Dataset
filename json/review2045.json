Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As Star Wars\\, it's okay good. As storytelling\\, it's terrible. Half of the plot is convoluted nonsense dependent on numerous characters being both incredibly lucky and complete morons. At no point did I believe anyone on either side was in a trained military\\, nor did I believe the fate of the galaxy was at stake for one second. The dialog was an absurd combination of misplaced quips and repetitive jargon\\, and in no way natural or interesting. And even where the plot bends over backwards to subvert our expectations\\, it chickens out and doesn't go far enough down the interesting roads presented. The timeline of the movie makes no sense\\, and the space battles are just bizarre and in no way like Star Wars\\, or for that matter like anything intelligible.\\n\\nRent the DVD\\, then just skip every scene that doesn't involve Rey\\, Luke\\, or Kylo Ren.","true":true}
