Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After giving it a days thought and seeing it a second time\\, I\u2019d give this movie a 7\/10. The problems that I had the first time are still there and more noticeable. Not a bad movie\\, but not that good... I never thought there would be such a cheesy Star Wars movie until I\u2019ve seen the TLJ. To many one liners\\, slow execution and poor plot decisions hinder this film from even being in the top 5. Go see this movie\\, but be prepared to experience something bland. ","true":true}
