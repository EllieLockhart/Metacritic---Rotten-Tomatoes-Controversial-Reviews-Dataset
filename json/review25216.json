Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice Visuals and special effect. horrible inconsistent storyline. I can 't believe how bad it was. i am not even a starwars fan\\, bit I did see the previous movies and there is no consistentie at all in character development and how the universe Works. I hate that.","true":true}
