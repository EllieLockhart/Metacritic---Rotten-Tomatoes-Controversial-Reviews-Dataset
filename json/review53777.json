Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie overall. I don't understand the critisism about a lot of things. \\n1st: Leia flying: Where is the problem with that...they can lift spaceships and force light people to death\\, but shielding you from the cold and holding your breath is too much? and it wasn't flying but just pulling her toward something...it's lifting a rock backwards...no issue with that\\n2nd: Sboke: he had as much screen time and background as the emporer in 5+6\\, and we had no problem with that. \\n3rd: Luke: Loved him\\, still sad that he died. but he was conflicted\\, because a lot of things happened since return of the jedi. and it showed\\n\\nStill a few flaws remain. my biggest one is the 18 hour chase. why didn't they jump closer? jump away and back? bring other ships? they had enough time to try a few times of necessary..nothing the rebels could to about it.\\n\\nI would consider me a hard core fan since I saw Jedi in 83 in cinemas..read many books...this is a movie I like as a fan. it's 2017 not 1977 so things are different and it's good that they are.","true":true}
