Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I had been anticipating this movie for some time\\, I was completely unprepared with how good it turned out to be.  For a movie as long as it was I can't remember one time looking at what time it was or how much was left.  Great job to everyone on this accomplishment!  5\/5 stars!  RIP Carrie Fisher!","true":true}
