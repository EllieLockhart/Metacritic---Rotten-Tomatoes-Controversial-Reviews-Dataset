Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly the worst star wars film I've ever seen. Worse than all three prequels put together. This film is so different in tone from every other film in the saga that it kills what makes star wars magical and shits on the legacy of the original saga. With a boring and weak plot the film drags on\\, the plot is compounded by flat character development and bad writing. The film starts off on a good note and quickly nosedives downhill. It feels like someone stitched together several episodes of a bad CW drama\\, set it in the star wars universe\\, and then called it a film. It completely killed my enthusiasm and interest in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. It is definitely not worth wasting your time on. It's one redeeming quality is that it's the most skippable star wars film because nothing important or interesting happens.","true":true}
