Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't hate this film\\, but I am very disappointed in it. For the record\\, I really wanted to like it. The best word I can use to describe this film: cringeworthy. How were so many of the film's decisions ever okayed?! Being unpredictable for the sake of shocking and surprising doesn't translate to a good film. Luke only barely teaches Rey anything (Rey basically trains herself). We see more of Luke's daily\\, grumpy life than any actual training. There is also a very shoehorned romance that was so cringeworthy. Humor is so distracting during some serious moments\\, so much so that the First Order never really feels like a threat. AND WHERE ARE ALL THE LEGACY ALIENS?! Not one Twi'lek\\, Ithorian\\, Trandoshan\\, Rodian\\, Gran\\, Quarren\\, Hutt\\, etc.\\, to be seen. Instead we get these aliens that look like this weird mash of Men-in-Black and the Hunger Games Capitol. New aliens are cool\\, but include some we've already seen before so that the galaxy feels connected. I see now that Disney's plan all along was to reboot the franchise\\, but to include a few classic characters here and there to disguise this trilogy as sequels. Disney is having way too much fun killing off the classic characters. I'm trying to prepare myself for the inevitable death of Chewbacca and the destruction of R2-D2 and C-3PO in episode 9. As much as I want to like this film\\, it just doesn't feel like Star Wars.","true":true}
