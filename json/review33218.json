Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a terrible film. The pacing was terrible. They only character development was with Kylo ren but only to an extent. It\u2019s like Johnson didn\u2019t care about who snoke was or any other questions that needed answering. Worse Star Wars movie ever. ","true":true}
