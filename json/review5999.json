Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing to say the least. Though most seem to hate the movie due to it killing off Luke\\, this movie was poor across the board. The acting was sub par and the writing was terrible. This movie does a better job of masking the fact that it borrows major scenes from the original trilogy\\, unlike the Force Awakens. It is easy to tell that Disney used a different writer from its predecessor as a lot of the setups from the last movie are abandoned. Worth a watch\\, but its definitely not on par with the quality I have come to expect from Star Wars movies and Disney","true":true}
