Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star Wars to date. Plot holes you can drive a star destroyer through. None of it makes a lick of sense\\, but when it turns out that you can destroy a whole fleet of imperial star destroyers by jumping one ship into hyperspace at close range\\, well that is just stupid. If that was always an option they should have done it in the first 10 minutes and then written a better story. Star Wars has well and truly jumped the shark.","true":true}
