Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not a Star Wars movie. I\u2019m not sure what it was. You can try new things and deviate from the formula while still staying true to the universe and spirit of the films\\, but this was not that. Self aware humor that winks at the viewer and pulls them out of the movie\\, entire plots that prove to have occurred for no appreciable reason\\, and repetitive social commentary (\u201ctoxic masculinity) that\\, while may make a good point as a sub plot\\, doesn\u2019t need to hijack the entire movie. What is the film supposed to be about anyway? I thought we were gearing up for Rey\u2019s journey\\, not tearing down all the other characters personality traits while leaving Rey\u2019s growth to be a sideshow. Also\\, alien cow nipples? Come on. ","true":true}
