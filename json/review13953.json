Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't like star wars or have never seen the legendary franchise then watch this\\, you'll love it. I mean Rian Johnson clearly hasn't seen star wars or he's done a great job as a troll.\\n\\nWhat an awful awful movie.\\n\\nThe only thing missing from my experience when I went to see this was a real life Mickey Mouse defecating on the audience whilst we all bought tickets.\\n\\nThe first time in my life I nearly walked out of a movie\\, although I suppose if you like Mary Poppins then you might like it.","true":true}
