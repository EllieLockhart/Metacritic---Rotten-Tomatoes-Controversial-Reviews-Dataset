Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"40 years and 7 months ago I went to see the first Star Wars\\, It was amazing and even with the many supposed flaws in it\\, it's still one of my favorite movies. I've gone to every Star Wars movie release\\, many first day\\, some first weekend\\, this one was end of first week. I have never been disappointed. Each one built on the history\\, and even though I am not one of the super geeks who has read the books and comics\\, watched the animated series (although catching up on that)\\, and played the video games\\, I am still a big Star Wars geek.\\nUnlike others who go into detail about the movie\\, I am just going to say I enjoyed it. It had a great story\\, great visuals\\, great sound\\, and continues the Star Wars Saga.I go in to a movie to escape real life\\, and to spend the time immersed in the show. This movie successfully did that for me. Star Wars movies are what I go to a theater to watch\\, many other movies I can wait for the dvd\\, streaming\\, services\\, to bring them out\\, but Star Wars in a big screen is a must see.","true":true}
