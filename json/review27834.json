Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I thought this movie was decent at best. It was mostly pretty good but it admittedly had it's questionable moments. For example\\, the whole mutiny idea with Poe was a bit too much in my opinion\\, along with the Canto Bight section. However\\, the visuals and acting are great\\, the action is overall done very well\\, and the characters are developed nicely. So in the end\\, I don't see eye to eye with those that claim that 'The Last Jedi' is a horrible movie. I just hope more people can see the good side of it.","true":true}
