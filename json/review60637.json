One of the best of the generation. The gorgeous graphics\\, incredible sound design and overall insane production quality isn't even the main reason why TLOU2 is so good.

The combat and general gameplay is great as well\\, the superb stealth sections stand out in particular. I do recommend playing the game on a higher difficulty\\, to really hammer home the survival horror aspects of the game. All in all\\, the game is just great\\, and people like different things\\, who would've thought. However almost every bad review I've seen and read for this game\\, boils down to \\\"I don't like girls\\, lesbians and Ellie isn't a straight white male\\, so I can't relate to her\\\". I hate to break it to you\\, but you're not really similar to Doomguy or Dante either. The game's story is beautifully crafted\\, and feeds off the momentum of the first game. The Last of Us 2 should\\, and will be remembered as one the defining games of it's generation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
