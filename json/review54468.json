Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I'm not sure what all the fuss is with the \\\"fanboys\\\" out there\\, but I really thought the story arc was an interesting take on this Star Wars story. Rian Johnson brought a renewed depth to the story that had been rather bleh in the Force Awakens. TFA was a rehash of New Hope and felt beautiful but unsurprising. The Last Jedi flips the storyline to touch on the points created by JJ's film while inverting the storyline of Darth Vader (move from Dark to conflict to Light?). I had no interest in seeing TFA more than once\\, but I have already seen The Last Jedi twice in theaters and might go at least once again. I think fallen heroes are an important trope that Johnson skillfully navigates to ultimately bring hope and Light back to the story.","true":true}
