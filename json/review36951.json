Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was kind of fun to watch. \\nBut here's everything I found annoying about this movie:\\n Snoke is a wasted character. He was a moron\\, claiming that he can read Emo Vader's thoughts and feelings\\, he is this incredibly powerful being and he dies like a bitch. \\n Luke Skywalker does not act like a wiser older Luke\\, instead he is a coward. \\n The Force mirror is pointless. \\n What's her name who took over for Leia caused the pointless casino scene when she decided to say nothing to Po\\, which also caused Fynn and what's her name 2 to be betrayed by the obvious rat on the imperial ship\\, which would have been avoided if Po and Fynn and everyone else on the ship was told the plan. \\n Leia either is dead when she gets ejected to space or kills the crew near the room when she re-enters through the destroyed room.\\n I liked that expectations were undermined. It had to be done correctly and it wasn't. This film wasted many of the subplots set up in The Force Awakens and wastes good characters and character development for wastes of time like Luke drinking sea cow milk\\, and the pointless casino scene.","true":true}
