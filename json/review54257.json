Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave myself a few days to settle my thoughts before rating The Last Jedi\\, (and despite the rumblings heard from Disney\\, this review - like many others on this site - is genuine and not from an army of fake accounts. There is no conspiracy\\, Disney.) I could nitpick all day\\, but I am going to leave it at this:\\n\\nWhen Mark Hamill states in an interview that the Luke in this movie is not \\\"his\\\" Luke Skywalker\\, that Luke would never have made any of the choices made in the film\\, and goes as far as joking that maybe it is someone else in the movie\\, perhaps someone named Jake Skywalker\\,.... there is a problem. And that problem is not fans being petulant\\, though that is what Disney is currently saying. It is the story itself. \\n\\nThe backlash against The Last Jedi is not a case of fans being angry because we didn't get what we want. It is that The Last Jedi spends a good portion of its run time doing its best to tell us the old characters don't matter\\, lecturing us on killing the past and letting our legends go\\, and then doing its best to make Luke as unlikable as possible so we will like other characters more. Furthermore\\, the salt in that wound is Johnson obviously thought we would be too stupid to realize we were being manipulated into buying what he is selling.... literally. He wants us to forget the old movies so we will embrace his new\\, non-Skywalker related Star Wars trilogy. What Johnson fails to realize is we would have been receptive to his new stories without any of that. Now he has isolated a large number of fans\\, so he has hurt the project more than he helped. \\n\\nThere were good points. There were moving moments. In this case\\, however\\, the bad outweighs the good\\, and nothing can be done about it now.","true":true}
