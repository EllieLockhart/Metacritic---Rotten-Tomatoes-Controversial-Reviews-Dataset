Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the grittier tone and Luke Skywalker's story arc. Not so much the daftness of Mary Poppins in space and the pointless trip to Harry Potter world. Trouble is\\, the chase in space part feels more like a drawn out TV episode than a film.","true":true}
