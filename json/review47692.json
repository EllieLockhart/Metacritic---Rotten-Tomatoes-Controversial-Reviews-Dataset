Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw the movie I left and had no clue what I felt about it. I felt a little disappointed because I\u2019d hyped it up for myself over the last two years. The movie was the longest Star Wars movie but in my opinion it did not feel long enough. I understand this is the middle of the trilogy so I don\u2019t think resolution would\u2019ve made sense. I feel like they somewhat ruined Poe\u2019s character\\, who was one of my favorites in TFA and now I find him irritating and annoying. My biggest critique for this movie is that too much happened\\, while I enjoyed almost all the story lines in this movie\\, they did not flow together as well as I would\u2019ve liked and therefore it felt a little overwhelming. There were so many beautiful shots and call backs to old iconic shots\\, the music as usual was a high point. Another criticism I have is when Rey reaches out into the force it seems as though we have been forced to watch a mature documentary. My favorite parts of the movie were the parts with Rey and Kylo Ren\\, in my opinion this seemed like the main plot line and the parts of the movie I wanted to see more off when it was done. I wish there had been more development of these scenes that would help make the movie flow and be more well rounded. While I was not left entirely satisfied with this movie\\, I can see how this could potentially lead to an epic conclusion of this trilogy. ","true":true}
