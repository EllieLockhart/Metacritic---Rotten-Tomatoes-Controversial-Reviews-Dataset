Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. While Mark Hamill is great\\, Luke Skywalker is completely out of character. The so called massive galaxy-spanning conflict feels completely insignificant and small scaled. Many sub plots are completely unnecessary and full of fluff. And the payoff on Snoke and Rey that fans have been waiting two years for is completely ridiculous. The music is not as special and epic as it used to be and the general direction the story is taking is entirely uninteresting.","true":true}
