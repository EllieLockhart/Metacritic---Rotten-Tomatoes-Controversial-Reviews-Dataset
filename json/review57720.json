Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter disappointment. Feel like it was directed by someone who seems to be either ashamed or actively dislikes Star Wars. Feels the need to change the material unnecessarily - not in an organic way but because of contempt.\\n\\nThe unnecessary and constant need to deconstruct everything ultimately robs of the movie of energy and a sense of fun and exploration. Star Wars is quality pulp. Rian doesn't seem to understand that. Despite all the 'bold' strokes\\, in the end\\, it's back where it was at New hope. There is no forward momentum whatsoever. People accuse TFA of pandering and rehashing TFA but that was subtle compared how much pandering this was of ESB and Return of the Jedi. It only seems to be taking risks but it is not. A complete retread and remixing of what came before with an air of contempt and just an exercise of futility.","true":true}
