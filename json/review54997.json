Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was just so bad it was clearly to rushed. the humour was adolescent and out of place for a star wars film\\, it works in marvel but not here. the acting was really bad compared to the first one and it tried so hard to make you emotionally attached to the cast but just failed. laura durn just comes across as a gross rude biatch and lets not even get started on the forced diversity. rian Johnson would ne much more suited to filming kids movies where substance and quality isn't as important.","true":true}
