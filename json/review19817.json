Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a story with no point that didn't need to be told. I wish they would get some courage\\, make a movie with real stakes & surprises and ditch the old cast. When Luke said \\\"This isn't going to go how you think\\\"\\, he was 100% wrong. Nobody in the theater gasped once.","true":true}
