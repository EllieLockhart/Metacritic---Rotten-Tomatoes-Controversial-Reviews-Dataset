Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film isn't Star Wars\\, it's a corporate rehash of Star Wars with no originality\\, inspiration or soul to it. An absolute disgrace to filmmaking and the arts in general. Not even 'in a galaxy far far away' is this a real Star Wars film. Utter disgrace. The good thing is\\, it highlights further just how fantastic George Lucas' original work is by stark contrast.","true":true}
