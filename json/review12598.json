Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't imagine how the critics are in such a consensus that this movie was that good. Thought Rian Johnson was trying to shock and awe too much. Also seemed like he either hated everything about the established universe or didn't care. Had it's good and bad but really disliked the forced humor; made me cringe on quite a few occasions. All in all it was enjoyable to watch but left me disappointed.","true":true}
