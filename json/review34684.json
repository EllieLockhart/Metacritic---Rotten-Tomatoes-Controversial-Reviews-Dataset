Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics are bought !!! It is crap. Episode 7 was bad\\, this was worse. Stupid argument. I do not know anyone who likes him. The critics paid by Walt Disney can not keep hiding that this film deserves to be one of the worst. I should be in the Razzies nominations.","true":true}
