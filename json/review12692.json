Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't be happier with this installment.   Rian zigged when the fanboys thought he would zag.   It definitely went in a new direction which I loved.  Lots of humor\\, tension and emotion.   A worthy entry into the Star Wars library.  Its certainly a long movie and probably could have 10 minutes trimmed\\, but thats a minor gripe.  Be prepared to be surprised.  If you like your Star Wars to follow a predictable plot\\, you may be disappointed.  If you have an open mind\\, then this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever.","true":true}
