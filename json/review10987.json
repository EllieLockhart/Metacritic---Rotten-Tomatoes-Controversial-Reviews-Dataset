Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen The Last Jedi 5 times so far I can only say this film is totally awesome. It stays true to the Star Wars univers while taking it in a new direction. I have been a fan since the beginning and I love the direction it is heading. Having avoided all the spoilers and seeing it totally fresh it was full of shocks and surprises plus some great acting performances too. I totally enjoyed it from the opening crawl to the end credits. Well done Rian Johnson and the whole team at  Lucasfilm","true":true}
