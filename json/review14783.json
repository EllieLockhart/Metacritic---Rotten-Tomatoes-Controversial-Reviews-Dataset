Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen this movie Called Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, and I have found it insulting.  This isn't Star Wars in my opinion.  Rian Declares his love for Star Wars\\, but after watching his responses to the fans dis-satisfaction with his vision\\, I am sure that he is lying.  \\n\\nRian Gave a Huge Middle finger to the Galaxy that is Far Far away\\, discarding established cannon for his own personal interests.  Instead of working within the framework of established understandings and history in world of Star Wars Rian took a self absorbed hammer to it and smashed all logical sense from it.\\n\\nHis stories within the story are weak and draw on the politics of the real world to preach SJW view points to the viewers.  A complete disconnect from ALL known Star Wars movies.\\n\\nHow did Rian get the job of directing this movie?  His portfolio of produced work is anemic and unimpressive in my view.  \\n\\nAll hands - Abandon Ship.. The Star Wars Universe has been Breached with stupidity.  For the love all things. I have NO idea what the hell JJ can do with this mess that Rian left.. but I almost no longer care","true":true}
