Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie who came with stupid idea of Emo Luke\\n\\nIt is sad to see how studios pay critics to do marketing\\n\\nFirst Luke and Snoke are both under utilized\\nLuke is made a sore person. He didn't lose faith in Vader and now he loses faith in anyone\\n\\nBut of course Disney will pay critics to give good marketing\\nSad.","true":true}
