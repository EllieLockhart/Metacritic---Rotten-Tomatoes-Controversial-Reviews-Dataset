Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll admit that I had high expectations going in.  I'd sheltered myself from the fan theories and trailers.  I wanted everything to fresh as it unfolded in front of me.  It didn't take long into the first act for me feel worried.  The sad attempt at humor between Hux and Poe totally ripped me out of the feeling that I was sitting in a Star Wars movie.  From there it only got worse.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed of themselves.  Nothing in this movie was \\\"fan service\\\".... It was all self service.","true":true}
