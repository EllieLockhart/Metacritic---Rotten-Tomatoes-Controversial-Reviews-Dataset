Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"character and logical inconsistencies made it difficult to suspend disbelief. Cringe inducing jokes and the blase fashion in which an endeared support character\\, who was given no more than a blip of screen time was killed off put even more nails in the coffin for this franchise and the arrival and loss of new characters made it impossible to develop attachments of any kind. The final fight near the end was positively silly and Kylo Ren did not appear to undergo any meaningful character development. I am in no way convinced that he is a credible threat to the resistance without his master there to call the shots. I will not be seeing the next installment in the theaters (and perhaps not at all) this movie franchise is dead as far as I'm concerned. My final verdict is that this movie is a string of flashy effects with no substance behind the story or characters therein.","true":true}
