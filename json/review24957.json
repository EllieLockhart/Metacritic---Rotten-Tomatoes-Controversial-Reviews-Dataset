Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My new Favorite Star Wars Movie!  Finally Luke Skywalker shows just how much of a complete badass he really is.  Kylo\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe\\, are all developed into characters that I can't wait to see what they do next!  Excellent Job\\, and at the moment this has unseated Empire Strikes Back as my favorite Star Wars movie!","true":true}
