Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best star wars stories... Well written and with major plot surprises... It added new perspectives and depths on its main characters that were carefully  physiologically justified.\\n\\nMemorable moment\\, the fight scene between Kylo and Rey\\, that were artistically displayed in a very impressive stage.\\n\\nPlus---one of the most beautiful deaths of a beloved character... \\n\\nColors\\, antithesis\\, wide range of feelings and the final catharsis that everyone seeks in a great film.\\n\\nWell done everybody!","true":true}
