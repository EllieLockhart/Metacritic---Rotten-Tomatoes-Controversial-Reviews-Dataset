Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucked. They destroyed everything that Star Wars was about. The philosophy of the Force\\, a powerful\\, wise and caring Jedi master willing to train a new hope... They killed Snoke just like that\\, Luke was a cranky old man\\, there was no training on the island\\, Reys' still a Mary Sue\\, cause she keeps winning fights untrained. What a mess. So sad they didn't explore or add anything to the saga. Pure action\\, nothing of the philosophy of the force. I'm so sad I said J.J wasn't good enough... And George\\, come back\\, please.","true":true}
