Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was seven. To all you idiots who's been living off of these fan theories and online we think this is going to happen crap\\, you'll be pissed.  For the rest of your normal People not living in your mothers basement jacking off to Star Wars fan theory\\, its a great flick.  These people giving this a low score are the same people that did not like the prequel's. In other words\\, their opinion doesn't matter. The critics got one right.","true":true}
