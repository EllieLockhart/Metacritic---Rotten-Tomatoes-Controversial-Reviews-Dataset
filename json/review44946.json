Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh\\nWay too long\\, way too boring\\, way too generic. I'm not a Star Wars nerd with high fan expectations\\, just a guy watching movies. This was not a SW movie.  Dialogue was crap\\, Poe is poorly written\\, Rey is mostly useless\\, no idea what Rose is supposed to be doing. Leia should have died\\, but WTF\\, but then Carrie did\\, so I guess she'll have to die anyway. Luke died(?) I think\\, but for no apparent reason\\, so I guess he comes back since Carrie died. Who knows? Jumbled mess of a movie that was more of a PC Guardians of the Galaxy remake than a Star Wars continuation. It even has Disney's furry version of minions\\, FFS. Not worth the trouble.","true":true}
