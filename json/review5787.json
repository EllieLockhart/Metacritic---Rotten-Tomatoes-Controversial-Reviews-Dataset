Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. First SW film I walked out of after and felt sad. Humor was stupid and out of place. SJW push was stupid: All women are strong\\, all men need fixing. Stupid chase plot that didnt make a lot of sense in a SW movie. Stupid casino plot that did nothing other then show off how bad rich people dont care about the evil going on and watch beaten animals for fun.","true":true}
