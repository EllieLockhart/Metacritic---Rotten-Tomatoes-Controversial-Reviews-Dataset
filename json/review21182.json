Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was VERY impressed with this movie.  It was\\, by far\\, the best acted Star Wars movie since ESB in 1980.  The plot and character choices were risky\\, which is why I think some others didn't like it.  But they were mature\\, stand up well upon review (I've seen it twice now)\\, and kept the audience guessing.  I watched dozens of fan theories online before I went and had a few of my own\\, and I was very please that R. Johnson managed to both fool us all as well as make it entertaining.  Go see it.  It's immensely entertaining\\, very funny at times\\, and has a couple of good morals to its story.","true":true}
