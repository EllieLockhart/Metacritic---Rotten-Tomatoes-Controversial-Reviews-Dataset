Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah just saw it\\, not a fan of this new canon.\\n\\nAnd seeing as there already 20+ novels\\, 19+ comic series\\, 3 movies\\, and 2 games (why the hell did they gave EA rights to the games is beyond me.) for this new Canon. 80% which I see\/read. Say what you want\\, but can't say I didn't give it a try. Think that more than enough to judge if it something I'll like it or not. And guess what like old EU was better this\\, grow up with it.\\n\\nFor those that like the new canon\\, glad for you. You all have years for new stuff to look forward to. As for me I'll go back reread\\, watch and play the old stuff. Still love Star Wars\\, but not the new canon.","true":true}
