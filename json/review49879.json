Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can see that the Last Jedi was an attempt to say\\, \\\"greatness can come from anywhere.\\\" It is\\, unfortunately\\, a message that is undone when you watch the utter pooh show that was Episode 9 that proclaims\\, no\\, the greatest heroes only come from royalty and aristocracy ... the rest of us are just spectators.","true":true}
