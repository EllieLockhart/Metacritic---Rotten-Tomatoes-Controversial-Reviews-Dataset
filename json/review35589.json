Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a film absolutely deserving of being at least nominated for Best Picture. Not just for what it is\\, but also for what it represents and successfully accomplishes. The Force Awakens was a great Star Wars movie. I think The Last Jedi crosses the threshold into being a great MOVIE. A fine piece of cinema\\, complete with messages and themes and subtexts\\, executed with precision\\, in a way that uplifts\\, inspires\\, and promotes thoughtfulness. The side plot is pointless \\\"setup for later films\\\" BS\\, but other than that. It's great.","true":true}
