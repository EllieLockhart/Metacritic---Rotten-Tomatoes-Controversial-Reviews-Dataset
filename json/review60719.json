I\u2019ll say this. Started off hating Abby because of what she did and because she looked stupid with her man body even though she\u2019s a woman but not transvestite? I may need to do some growing mentally but I don\u2019t think a women can have a body like that but maybe I\u2019m wrong. Anyway this is how good the story telling is.

I went from loathing this person throughout this game and wanting her dead to having a complete change of heart by the end of the game. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever experienced that in a game. Now for my rant. **** these dumb ass losers who are so whining  about a supposed \u201cSJW\u201d narrative that in no way is present. I think if anything Neil ****ed up by portraying a strong woman as a man and should get backlash by women instead of these **** ass dudes that are so but hurt because they couldn\u2019t play as Joel? Get the **** over it!!! Loss is a part of life\\, and it\u2019s the reason the journey even happens. Play the game don\u2019t listen to these morons. You will get frustrated with the story at times but there\u2019s a methid to the madness  and you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised if you play to the end. Happy gaming!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
