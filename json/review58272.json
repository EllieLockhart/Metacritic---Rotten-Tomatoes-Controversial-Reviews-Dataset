Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely abysmal quality for a Star Wars movie. No questions answered\\, a terrible plot\\, terrible jokes that don't belong in a star wars movie. It's almost as if Rian Johnson didn't watch episode 7. I could go on and on about the plot holes and areas of the movie that just don't make sense. I wish Rian Johnson could just be banned from writing starwars content indefinitely. Besides that although the visuals were nice (since they are Star Wars based) Rian completely wasted Luke and just killed him off\\, as well as killed Snoke off (supposedly)\\, after playing him as this huge and powerful leader as well as completely dismissing any backstory he should have gotten. Also Rey is still a mary sue\\, if not even more so than the previous movie.","true":true}
