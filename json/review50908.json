Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute chills. The greatness of the Star Wars franchise continues. Visually stunning. Great cinematography. The light saber fights\\, the action sequences\\, the plot twists\\, the story telling\\, BB-8... sooooo good! Can't wait for the next.","true":true}
