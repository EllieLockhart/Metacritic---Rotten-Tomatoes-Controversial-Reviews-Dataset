Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a SMUG\\, self-righteous film this is! It mocks\\, derides and diminishes beloved heroes. It literally tells you to \\\"destroy the past!\\\"  It has no RESPECT for the heritage it derives its $Billion$ from and even less respect for YOU\\, the audience.  Well heres giant middle-finger right back at you Disney!","true":true}
