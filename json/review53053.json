{"101487":105686,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As I readied myself to watch the new installment in the Star Wars franchise the same awe and wonder began to set in as the first time I watched \\\"A New Hope.\\\"  ...ill give it to Rian Johnson despite the shitty Marvel humor that took away from potentialy important scenes the opening segment of the First Order dreadnaught being bombed was pretty great. Unfortunately the entire movie felt like a big F@$k you to fans. Tje Last Jedi continued after the Force Awakensbut not much more then that it completely made existing plots from previous films irrelevant... seriously? \\n\\nC'mon I get it. The Skywalker story has to end old story lines cant go forever and this movie did a great job telling us that over and over again. \\n\\nBut really? Luke milking a mamal like creature while awkwardly starring at the camera? Really? \\n\\nCant wait for the next film. Star wars and the quest for more money.","true":true}
