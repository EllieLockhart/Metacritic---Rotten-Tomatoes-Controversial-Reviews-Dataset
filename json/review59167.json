First of all the gameplay is clearly better than the predecessor even though people keep saying it's outdated. Sure it could use some refinement here and there but it's pretty solid as it is. Also people saying that the gameplay is behind are stupid because this game is based on the same engine as Uncharted 4 is and noDon't listen to all of the butthurt haters review bombing this game.

Also people saying that the gameplay is behind are stupid because this game is based on the same engine as Uncharted 4 is and no one complained about that games gameplay?!
