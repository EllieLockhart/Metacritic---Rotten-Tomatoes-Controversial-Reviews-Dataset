Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\" - Luke Skywalker\\, TLJ\\n\\nYou can't help but feel that Luke Skywalker is talking to the viewer. The Last Jedi is a riveting addition to the franchise. Its fresh approach to a pretty formulaic franchise invigorates the series. There are moments when Johnson's risks pay off in the most satisfying way. Conversely there are moments when the risks taken fall flat. All in all\\, I enjoyed the film. This is hands down the most unique Star Wars film to date in the Skywalker saga. Its worth the ticket price to see it in the theater. \\n\\nThe Disney-ization of Star Wars has become more apparent in the company's second act of their sequel trilogy. The overtones of feminism\\, diversity\\, and self-sacrifice throughout this film seem a bit heavy-handed and redundant. While these aren't bad things to introduce to a franchise that has historically lacked in these areas\\, it felt a bit too much for a single film. There are moments while watching The Last Jedi that feel like Disney is catering to the politically correct zeitgeist only for the sake of bumping their own merchandising profits.","true":true}
