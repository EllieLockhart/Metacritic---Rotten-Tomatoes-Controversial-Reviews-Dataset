Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lets discuss this travesty. From the title text you can tell that this was the laziest written film in the Star Wars saga. Over explained dialogue throughout the film is reminiscent of watching my 6 year old play with his legos. Key characters get written off as though they were extras. Plot points throughout crumble. Character dynamics are thrown into a tizzy. Along with cheesy puns\\, \u00c3\u00a2??Porgs\u00c3\u00a2??\\, and sloppy childish directing this film completely disgraced the brilliance of JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens and the gritty brilliance of Rogue One. \\n\\nThis film does somehow macaw the impossible however. Somehow they managed to make The Phantom Menace look good. Worst movie of the franchise.","true":true}
