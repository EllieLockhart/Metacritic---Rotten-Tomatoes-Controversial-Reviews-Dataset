Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Disney has begun to ruin a beloved franchise. Without spoiling too much\\, the plot is cringy and terrible\\, acting is corny (although much of that is the script's fault)\\, and visuals seem to be taking a turn for the worst. I'm disappointed\\, but I sort of felt this was coming after the decidedly meh TFA.","true":true}
