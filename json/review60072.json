Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A let down after 7 years of waiting.\r\rThe first game is probably my favourite game of all time and this is coming from a PC gamer. The story of the first brings out the emotions that i thought i never had inside of me. The second came and I stayed away from all the leaks and news so that I can go in with a fresh set of mind and within the first hour of playing\\, i wish i had just look at the leaks in the first place. There are good things in this game: music is good\\, sound is better than the first\\, graphic and environment is breathtaking... But that is what you would expect after 7 years of development\\, \\, gameplay is fine\\, not terrible but not amazing neither\\, dialogue is poorly written\\, almost every interactions between characters are corny and cringe\\,  but the core of the problem of this game is the story. There are three major things that ruin the game: Joel's death\\, Abby and the ending. First of all\\, I don't mind killing an important character like Joel\\, but the way that the developers did it was purely for shock value and after playing through the whole game and reach the ending\\, makes you realized that Joel's death is extremely pointless. Next is the elephant in the room\\, Abby. No\\, its not about how she look\\, is how she was written and introduced. We know nothing about this woman before and when we play as her and after finishing her playthrough we still know nothing about her. She was introduced and 20 minutes later\\, she killed the most important character of the franchise\\, and it does not help when straight after she killed the characters you love does you get to know about her justification and why she is doing the thing she is doing. Also her justification is pure cliche and it is clear as daylight that the devs tried so hard to make us like Abby by degrading Ellie. There is so much thing wrong with Abby that you can goes on for days discussing it. Finally is the ending. The devs tries to tell us that killing and revenging is bad\\, Ellie is a terrible person and Abby deserve to live. Then explain the hundreds of people that they both killed just to get to that point and I just can't understand the thinking process of degrading Ellie like that. She does nothing wrong to deserve any of this Abby and in the end she has to live with her fear. The story is a shotgun blast to the knee and a golf club to the head to any people who is passionate about the first game. This is already a terrible year and somehow Naughty Dogs made it worse by lying to us and mistreating us multiple times just to cover up their own mistakes. I'm disenchanted and I'm sure everyone feel the same way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
