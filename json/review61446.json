We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us part 2 really shows how weak and boring the ganeplay is once you strip away the fantastic story and characters of the first game. Part 2 is so focused on setting up shock value to try to make the player as angry and traumatized as Ellie by Joel's death that it forgets hoe to tell a story. Joel has to act out of character in order for him to be vulnerable in the first place while stacking up  Coincidences one after another. They game does have an investing idwmea here and there such as making the player play as the antagonist for roughly half the game and has you fight against the protagonist while doing so. However the game fails to get the big payoff for this due to its shallow emotional set ups. Im sorry\\, but having npc bad guys call out a completely random person's\\, or dog's\\, name when they die is pointless at best and comical at worst. Speaking of comedy\\, there is an entire section of the game where a full blown pregnant woman is running around a battlefield simply because she can't be told what she can and can't do is moronic to the point I was crying with laughter. That dame character then passes moral judgements on everyone while the game clearly wants me to care and reflect on how selfish Abby is but all I can think about is \\\"that baby dead\\\".The gameplay is  Mediocre at best.The story is laughable\/frustratingly bad.The main cast of characters have been ruined by poor out of chatacer choices.The supporting cast is weak and uninteresting at best and laughable at their worst.Acting\/voice acting is the best videogames has to offer.Sound design is great.Graphics are truly unbelievable and right up there with God of War and Final Fantasy 7 Remake as the best the ps4 has to offer.The question becomes how much do graphics\\, sound design\\, and acting mean in a game with such a heavy focus on Story and and Chacter? For me\\, the answer is about 4 points out of 10 because what is the point of these things if the reason I am playing the game in the first place is story and character? This game is a beautiful house built on sand.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
