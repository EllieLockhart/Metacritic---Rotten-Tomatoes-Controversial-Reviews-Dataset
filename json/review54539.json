Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan\\, had high hopes for this this movie\\, especially considering how much I liked Force Awakens\\n\\nThe good: \\nloved the special effects and the x wing scene at the beginning of movie.\\n\\nThe bad:\\nThe liberal politics made this movie unwatchable.  I can handle subtle politics in movies\\, but this was slap you in the face liberal garbage.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie so anti male\/bra burning feminist as this.  I'm ok with female lead characters\\, but when every single hero is a female and every bad guy is a white male it gets a bit ridiculous.  An entire scene in the movie was also created just to lecture us that capitalism is bad\\, weapons are bad\\, and a subtle jab that Fergusen was justified.  I can deal with a crapoy storyline\\, but this is the first Star Wars movie I won't see again and it's due to politics.\\n\\nAside from that\\,this movie laid waste to an icon in Luke.  No grand finale\\, no chance to show off his master Jedi skills\\, nope just a hologram.\\n\\nVery disappointed by the lack of light saber fights in this movie.  \\n\\nThis movie surely had the worst finale by far of any Star Wars movie.  The Prequels blew this out of the water there.\\n\\nKylo Ren was a great villain with his mask on in Force Awakens.  Without it he's kinda boring.\\n\\nRoses character seems pointless \\n\\nChewbacca was great-for the little we saw of him.\\n\\nRey is a Mary Sue\\, kind of the character the corporate Disney execs want you to believe is the all powerful hero\\, problem is it's just not that believable.\\n\\nPoe plays a likable character\\, when he's not getting pushed around by a gang of Feminazis.  \\n\\nHoldo is the most unlikeable character ever created\\, should be cast into a pit on Tattouine and slowly digested over 1000 years.\\n\\nDisney needs to never ever let Rian Johnson near one of their cameras ever again.  JJ did a great job with TFA\\, but not one storyline is set up for him going into the final movie.\\n\\nThere's only one way for Disney to rescue this one: opening scene Poe wakes up from a bad dream (which means episode 8 never happened).  Luke would still be there\\, Snoke would be there\\, Rey's parents would still be a nice mystery\\, and it would be like a do over. \\n\\nI can't in words describe how disappointed I was with this movie.  I've liked every Star Wars movie-even the Prequels\\, but this was terrible","true":true}
