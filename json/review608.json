I have an absolute blast loading this up and playing with a bunch of friends to see who will survive and die. Once the murderer plot goes we get a lot more interesting villains which I won't spoil but I love them so much and I did my research later on them. This game has interesting lore with files scattered throughout the levels when you get to play yourself. Most of the characters are very likeable (apart from Emily) and I always wanted them to survive\\, I do wish though we got more time with Jessica. I was always invested to see what happens and it does have some surprised which will leave you interested in where the story goes. All the endings are in some way satisfying but my favorite thing is the credits if people survive it is interesting and should not be skipped.\r\rThis is an underrated gem on the PS4 and is definitely a must buy for all horror fans of either movies or video games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
