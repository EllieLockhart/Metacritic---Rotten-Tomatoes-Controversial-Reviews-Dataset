Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember how the last movie was about finding the map made by Luke so that he is able to be found in case the galaxy needs him? Yeah well fuck it Luke decided he just doesn't care and wants to die. Remember how it's supposed to take years before jedi even attain the rank of padawan and then BEGIN training with a lightsababer? Lol please\\, Rey's got that skywalker blood\\, she basically takes on Luke (the most powerful force user ever) no problem with zero training. Remember how the good guys win (although being at a huge disadvantage) by outsmarting the bad guys? Nah\\, no need for that lets just make them oblivious to anything resembling a logical thought.\\n\\nLet me summarize how the movie should have gone\\, if it made any sense. The first order attacks as resistance is evacuating\\, resistance manages to get away but the first order tracks them\\, resistance gets attacked again moments after escaping from first order but first orders big fleet is too slow at keeping up with resistance's smaller fleet\\, after seeing how Kylo and about 4 Tie fighters manage so blow up the command section of the resistance's main ship they decide to send in more of their smaller ships and everyone dies\\, the end. \\n\\nIf you've never seen any of the older movies or have any previous  knowledge on the star wars universe\\, this could probably pass as an okay movie. But if not save your money\\, this movie literally just says fuck it to all the previous lore.","true":true}
