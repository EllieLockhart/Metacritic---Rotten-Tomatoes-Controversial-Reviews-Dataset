Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Obviously the critics are too scared to give an honest review of a Star Wars movie or a Disney movie. And since this is both\\, they\u2019re bowing to the almighty mouse for fear of fan and Disney retribution. The story is a mess\\, there\u2019s too many plot lines going at once\\, it tries to be a Marvel version of a Star Wars movie - and not in a good way. The prequels sucked\\, but they at least felt like Star Wars.","true":true}
