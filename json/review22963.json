Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lot of fake reviews on this movie. It was very disappointing and did not feel like star wars at all. Nothing about it was authentic to the originals\\, and the story just like the previous one is just a bad copy of the originals.\\nThis movie owes George Lucas an apology","true":true}
