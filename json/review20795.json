Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie. I've  loved Star Wars ever since i was little and this movie really disappointed me. It makes no effort to utilize the setup from the Force Awakens and basically throws away every original character's arc from the original trilogy. They gloss over or ignore gaping plot holes in favor of a meaningless subplot that goes nowhere. I walked away from this movie with the sense that the filmmakers wanted to break away from what they thought were overly used plot devices and tropes that they needlessly complicated and subverted what should have been an amazing movie.  My advice if you still want to see this movie\\, wait for it to hit the bargain bin because I think it will be the first Star Wars movie to end up there.","true":true}
