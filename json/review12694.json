Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i couldnt belive what i was seeing this movie sucked so bad..i went opening night even a few Boos after we left the crows was so quiet at the end  nobody seemed to like it..i agree  im looking forward to the SOLO movie   part 8 is dead on arrival","true":true}
