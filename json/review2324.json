Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A true passing of the torch from the original cast to the new cast!  I loved it\\, and i didn't want it to end\\, even two and a half hours later as the credits rolled\\, i wanted more!\\n\\nAs Luke interacts with Leila\\, he truly stood in for ALL of us who miss Carrie Fisher. The force will be with her\\, always.","true":true}
