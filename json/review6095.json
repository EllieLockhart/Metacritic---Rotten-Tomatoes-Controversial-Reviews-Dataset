Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney and KK have destroyed what fans loved about this saga and it\u2019s underlying ideology. They destroyed all the characters fans loved with no remorse. SW is dead.","true":true}
