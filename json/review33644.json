Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, Leah Poppins\\, Rose \\\"JAr jar binks\\\" Tico\\, rey (whose father must be superman)\\, Finn who remains pointless as his adversary phasma does as well\\, purple haired lady who acts like a child the whole time yet is suppose to be a great leader. all of it just terrible and stop trying to be funny rion Johnson you aren't good at it","true":true}
