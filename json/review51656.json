Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A decidedly different direction than what The Force Awakens suggested in many ways\\, and that's a good thing. This go around doesn't feel tired or redone whatsoever. My one criticism is some of the jokes seemed forced. \\nOverall\\, it pushed the story forward at the right pace\\, touched on new moral lessons\\, and tapped into the archetypes of mythology like star wars is supposed to do. It seems some people are upset that the movie didn't play out the way they thought it would\\, but I liked seeing something fresh in the series. This is one of my favorites.","true":true}
