Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bad film\\, but a very bad Star Wars plotwise: it completely disregards Episode VII's promising teased elements and manages to damage Original Trilogy characters in both active and passive actions. Enjoyable by those who do not care about the existing Star Wars universe and characters; very disappointing otherwise. Good acting performances; bad comic reliefs. As visually and musically great as a Star Wars film should be.","true":true}
