{"101487":170376,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-11","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a horrible film.\\n\\nIf you're really in to a very slow car chase in space\\, watching old men molest sea-cows\\, disjointed stories with glaring plot holes\\, casual irreverence of source material\\, neglect of previous foreshadowing\\, complete dis-regard for the laws of physics in outer space\\, and an over-drawn side-story of a failed adventure which aggressively tackles Galactic animal cruelty yet completely ignores child slavery and human trafficking and the climactic moment of the act has Rose cutting off the saddle of one of the horse\/dogs and defiantly saying\\, \\\"Now it's worth it.\\\" ... despite having completely failed in their mission\\, only to have the same characters botch it all again at the end of the film as Fin makes a heroic move to save all his friends but is stopped by Rose in a move which should have killed them both as an act of their \\\"well established\\\" (sarcasm heavily implied) love connection\\, then this is a movie for you.\\n\\nI feel like the only reason people like this movie is simply because it has Star Wars in its title. I personally found a couple things I genuinely like about this movie but I'm gonna air out all this dirty laundry first:\\n\\nThe slow space chase was just a dumb idea. This seems like an obvious draw-back to the film\\, so I'll only add that all the First Order had to do to end it all was send one of their Star Destroyers ahead to cut them off and force a confrontation. Why wait 18 hours for them to run out of gas? Because we needed a bloated Casino scene\\, that's why.\\n\\nI'll tell you where I really lost it with the Casino planet and Rose: She tells Fin to look closer as she begins to explain that her upbringing with her sister was in a similar situation of forced child labor. Fin zooms in and we see a child get beaten back by a much larger man as he's trying to reign in one of the horse\/dog things. I thought to myself\\, \\\"Dang! Tackling child abuse\\, child labor\\, and human trafficking in a Star Wars film?! Now that IS a bold move!\\\" Only to have it immediately shift to the abuse of the animals and just completely forget about an actual troubling problem which could have given Rose's character depth and meaning to the film! Then (having lived what these slave children are currently living as she just got done explaining) she manipulates that small kid into NOT going to his slave-owner as they're about let all those animals go and (again emphasizing that she KNOWS the kind of life these kids are living) uses her clout as a member of the Rebellion to set a false pretense that\\, somehow\\, by letting her steal these animals\\, she'll come back or save that little kid later and that there will be no repercussions for his direct contribution for helping these criminals ... she KNEW that as she left and all those animals were now gone\\, the KIDS would be the ones to suffer the consequences of a cruel master. She exploited her position with the Rebellion to manipulate a small child that would only suffer more abuse at her expense. Is that amiable in any way? Does that make her character \\\"refreshing\\\" or \\\"genuine\\\" as I've seen others describe her? I would argue that behavior makes her disgusting and a greater monster than those she told Fin to look loser at. \\n\\nWhen I first walked out of the theater\\, my initial response was\\, \\\"That was a good movie\\, but not a good Star Wars movie.\\\" By that I meant it just didn't feel like I was watching a Star Wars Space Opera: no one said\\, \\\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\\\" They introduced flash-back sequences which George Lucas never did because he wanted the films to be seen in the here and now without distracting you from what was actually going on with the characters of the story. Slow-motion scenes to dramatize Luke's combat skills or ships blowing up just don't really belong in a Star Wars film. This movie also seemed to really push \\\"Hollywood\\\" agenda as every male character in the film was either the bad guy\\, belittled\\, demoted\\, or just completely rendered insignificant to make room for more empowering women role models. Some may argue that Star Wars films have always had political undertones for their era\\, but I would argue to allow them to be undertones instead of the primary themes of your fascist fan-film. I don't know why at least two characters said\\, \\\"God speed\\, Rebels.\\\" in a universe where no deity has ever really been established. Why not say\\, \\\"May the Force be with you.\\\"? This is a Star Wars film\\, isn't it? Why did Poe call it a\\, \\\"Big ass door.\\\" or other other idioms form our own vernacular that Star Wars writers often avoided to keep the illusion that we were experiencing life in a Galaxy Far Far Away? So again\\, I have to emphasize that this film just didn't feel like a Star Wars film. The other Star Wars films moved their characters forward\\, this one took every character previously introduced in a gigantic step backwards. I understand that the theme of this film was failure in nearly every aspect of the word ... well congratulations Rian Johnson\\, you've made a movie that makes Episode 1 look like Casablanca by comparison.\\n\\nI need to continue on the feminist vein for a moment. Vice Admiral Holdo was my least favorite character of the film. Her inclusion in the film was very forced and instead of allowing me\\, as an audience member\\, to come to a conclusion about how I felt about her I found myself just being told that I'm supposed to like her: Poe said something about a battle she won\\, Leia has to spell out her motives for the audience ... because\\, what: I'm too dumb to figure it out for myself? They kill off all Resistance leadership in one single blow simply to add another feminist role model. Give me a freaking break: wouldn't it have been cool to have an established character I already relate to\\, like\\, and who has proven combat and leadership experience from previous films sent off in a glorious blaze of heroism as more of the past is \\\"let go\\\" as another iconic member of the Star Wars family selflessly sacrifices his existence for the cause? Instead\\, we have a meaningless death which is overshadowed by Leia and her Merry Poppins-ing back to the ship to make a different point. Why did they force a new character upon us when Admiral Akbar would have been the perfect candidate to save the Rebellion one last time? Because\\, feminism\\, that's why.\\nFeminism used to be about equality and has since turned into \\\"women have to be better and more significant than men.\\\" It's no longer about gender equality and instead we live in a world where the feminist movement thinks they have to prove they're superior to men and the world doesn't need men at all. What I liked about Star Wars (1977) was that it DID balance the playing field between the genders and it did strike a very resounding chord for gender equality: Leia was the first self-rescuing princess who\\, when the hero's tried to rescue her\\, she ended up saving THEM from certain doom! Where was that in the Last Jedi? It was completely absent. Every male protagonist fell under the heal of a more overbearing woman. Men are not all cowards\\, weak\\, impulsive failures and I resent that representation of my gender when Star Wars has traditionally been very good for gender equality. My cousin called me shallow for saying as much\\, so if that makes me shallow\\, I'll continue to play in the kiddy pool. \\n\\nPhysics in space ... bloody hell. At least try. I mean\\, I get that it's a movie\\, but can you at least try for Force sake? Why is there a vacuum some times and not in others? I thought the whole first space battle was going to be epic\\, but I just couldn't get over the glaring problems of basic physics in space. Since when does gravity matter in a vacuum? How the hell are bombs supposed to drop out of bomb-bay doors if there is no gravity to pull them down? The argument for this blasphemy is that George Lucas modeled the space battles after WWII dog-fights and such\\, so having bombers drop bombs on the dreadnought was paying homage to that premise. Bull crap. Y-Wings and B-Wings were the designated bombers for the Alliance which is why they were the first to be sent into the Death Star Trench in Episode IV. So you've already got source material which you completely ignore and if you want to emulate actual military capabilities and tactics\\, why not look at our current military capabilities: the B-1 bomber can launch it's entire payload from over 500 miles away to pin-point accuracy? Because you're lazy and want to move your failure story further first. Also\\, why wasn't Rose's sister sucked out into the vacuum of space when she was trying to drop those bombs? She opened the doors\\, no force field was active ... it was just dumb.\\n\\nLight-speed weapons aren't a thing in the Star Wars. Google it. Wookipedia confirms that Hyperspace pulls from String-theory principles and Hyperspace is actually a different dimension that is not affected by other physical objects (such as space debris or other ships\\, which is why ships don't collide when they are in Hyperspace) but is affected by gravitational anomalies (such as black holes or planets as explained by Han Solo in E.IV) and is entered by achieving light-speed. Furthermore\\, if we can assume that both First Order and Resistance ships are made of similar materials\\, Newtons 3rd law of physics would require the smaller ship to suffer complete destruction and only minor damage to the larger ship would be sustained: shooting a steel bullet into a steel box would destroy the bullet and only dent the box. Then you could argue that F=MA when A is basically infinite at light speed except that at light speed you enter Hyperspace and wouldn't physically be present to collide with the other ship. There is also inconsistency between the end of Rogue One and this film because all the Rebel ships tried to escape and ran in to Vader's Star Destroyer and crashed ... not completely destroying Vader's ship. Semantics really at this point\\, and I suppose arguing actual science in a Si-Fi film by someone who doesn't really know any of that is mute.\\n\\nI would say the culmination of my thoughts from the film are that Rian Johnson crapped on everything The Force Awakens went to set up: Rey is nobody ... let's just gloss over that with one line and figure that's good enough for the fans. The First Order suffers a catastrophic loss (Star Killer Base) yet is completely unaffected by it and supposedly has the resources to still take over the Galaxy somehow. Phasma was an under-used character in the last one\\, so let's just do that again and kill her off for no good reason. Snoke ... oh my. If you're going to introduce a character that claims he witnessed the rise and fall of Vader in a Galaxy where the Emperor had a firm grasp on Force users as either being one of two Sith Lords or hunted down and\/or Exiled Jedi\\, you have to be able to explain why the Emperor allowed someone as powerful as Snoke to stay alive. At least give me a little of his back story\\, oh wait\\, we'll just cut him in half and that'll be good enough for the fan theories.\\n\\nFolks complain that Rey is very Mary-Sue and has had no training to explain her powers. It bothers me\\, but Snoke explained it by addressing the fact that as Darkness rises\\, the Light will as well to meet it (the Darkness). So I kind of took it as a very lazy way to not have to show any character growth for her in the film\\, but it is an explanation. I don't really know why people don't like Kylo Ren\\, I think he's a pretty awesome villain\\, but was disappointed with Rian's execution of what he \\\"saw\\\" Kylo becoming or doing: kind of an underwhelming character\\, right along with the rest of the cast. And where were the Knights of Ren? Going in to this film I thought Luke was going to be awesome and he just wasn't. I've heard people complain that it's against his \\\"character\\\" to go into hiding etc\\, but I actually didn't mind this version of him because it made sense as to why he's been gone for so long. I actually really like Mark's performance in this film\\, but I ultimately was disappointed that Luke was a washed up nobody\\, even though it fit with the theme of the film. The fight scene with Rey and Kylo was entertaining and Luke's death was poetic. My final conclusion was that The Last Jedi did a fine job of killing off (either physically or metaphorically) every character I previously cared about without creating any lasting impressions or connections to the new characters introduced. Feel free to counter my arguments\\, but I just don't think I care about this new franchise anymore. \\n\\nOne star because \\\"Star Wars\\\" was in the title.","true":true}
