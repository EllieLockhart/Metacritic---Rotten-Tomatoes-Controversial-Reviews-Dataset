Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For viewers who are hoping for a story consistent with the previously existing star wars stories\\, disappointment is an understatement. This movie series has somehow managed to not only make Luke Skywalker a boring old grump\\, but the entire destruction of the empire\\, the sith\\, and the death star was as it turns out\\, didn't matter. The new characters are uninteresting\\, and the story is nonsensical. I gave it 2 stars for the cinematography.","true":true}
