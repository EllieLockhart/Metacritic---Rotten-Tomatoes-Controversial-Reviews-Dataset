Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a terrible movie.   The central plot didn't make sense.  The main subplot was pointless and did not add to the narrative.  The comedy had tone issues that made heroes no longer heroic and villains no longer villainous.  The movie also had continuity issues with the other movie of the trilogy and with the entire movie series.  I disliked how the character of of Luke Skywalker was handled.  The special effects were great. 1\/10","true":true}
