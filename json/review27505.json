Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I like the new characters in the new Star Wars movies and I think the franchise needed the new blood. What I don't understand is the drive to destroy the original movies and heroes. I get the plot point to kill off Han Solo to send Kylo to the dark side\\, except it didn't! He's still a whiny brat that's mad at his family. And what they did to Luke Skywalker in this movie made no sense. Every scene was totally out of character from the established history. This is Star Wars without the heart! Someone needs to let them know its possible to pull in new fans without totally alienating the old ones.","true":true}
