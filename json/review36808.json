Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie takes a dump on Luke's character\\, underwhelming reveal of Rey's parents\\, no background info on Snoke\\, love story was undeveloped\\, half of the plot was recycled from episode V\\, Phasma returns but does nothing. Worst Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
