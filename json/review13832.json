Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If TFA was a slap in the face\\, then The Last Jedi is a knife in your guts. It's a horrendously badly written\\, focusless\\, directionless\\, awfully long\\, stinking mess from yet again a director who does not have the faintest idea what Star Wars is about. TLJ reveals that there absolutely never was a story for Disney's sequel trilogy\\, after all. There are no character arcs either (save for\\, maybe\\, Kylo's). The only 'grand idea' they had was to kill our old heroes one by one and destroy everything they stood for. To destroy everything we loved about Star Wars. Did they at least replace them with something worthy? Well\\, since from Finn to Phasma\\, from Maz to Hux\\, from Snoke to the new characters (Rose\\, Admiral Holdo\\, or the Codebreaker) everybody proves to be nothing but filler (even more so than in the already dreadful TFA)\\, the answer is a definite No. Stick to Rogue One. That's the only post-Lucas SW movie that is worthy of the name. The Last Jedi? A new low\\, but I'm afraid we still haven't reached the bottom of the barrel.","true":true}
