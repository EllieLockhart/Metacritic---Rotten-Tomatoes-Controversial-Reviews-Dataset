Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me preface this by saying I only made an account to rate this   movie. That is how passionate I am about how mediocre this movie was. Though this film was pretty entertaining with lots of 'WTF' moments\\, overall the content of the film including and especially characterization was extremely far off and disappointing. Additionally it was as if Rey was only there to further Kylo's character development and plot which was extremely upsetting especually when she was such a strong and independent character in 'The Force Awakens' (dir. JJ Abrams\\, 2015). Rian actually said in an interview that he wrote this screenplay before 'The Force Awakens' even came out and it definitely shows. It's almost as if all the characters were made up or completely different. Mark Hamill himself even said he felt uncomfortable with the characterization of Luke and Rian still went ahead with it. It was just incredibly disappointing to see the characters of one of my favourite films be butchered to death like this. RIP Star Wars","true":true}
