Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The gravity of how bad this film is will not be easy to overstate... From the first shot\\, it is clear something has gone terrible wrong in its making. The very first line is delivered so badly by a female resistance fighter that it seemed like a parody of a B-movie. This is then followed by an interaction between Po and General Hux that is intended to be funny but also\\, in the space of 1 minute\\, completely undermines any credibility the First Order had developed from the Force Awakens as the villains. Such attempts at humour are rammed in at every available opportunity\\, and seem to be purposefully designed to deflate the important moments of the story of any dramatic depth.\\n\\nThe movie moves along at an unrelenting pace\\, much like the previous one\\, never allowing the quieter moments that often provide the colour and subtle nuance to the characters. Instead\\, Rey\\, Finn and Po are never developed beyond their base motivations. Their emotional state entirely relates to whether they being impeded or making progress towards achieving their singular goals. Finn gets really upset if he can't get to Rey (basically because he wants to get it on with her) and then is happy when he sees her. That literally his entire character. Rey is exactly the same\\, except her base motivation is finding out who she is. \\n\\nWe then hurtle along in to multiple unnecessary subplots and characters. The two new female characters are shoehorned in to make a feminist political statement and actively detract from the movie. Po and Finn could have gone off to look for the codebreaker\\, allowing them to actually bond (they've only spent all of about 1 hour with each other at this point). Instead we have to deal with the most boring character of all time in Rose\\, while also dealing with Holden or Honda or whatever it was basically making you care less and less about the resistance with every single one of her lines. Oh but then in a twist she's actually a genius hero who saves everyone (because women can't be anything but awesome in movies now) while Po (probably the most interesting protagonist honestly) is a typical irrational hotheaded male. The whole plot is based on his plan\\, and in the end it comes to nothing but an opportunity to ram yet more political statements about animal rights and income inequality. Seriously\\, when will Hollywood stop forcing this shit down people's throats. Star Wars is meant to be an escape. \\n\\nBut I digress... The film could have survived all of that if it weren't for the sinful portrayal of Luke Skywalker. Yes\\, sinful. The hopeful\\, idealistic hero of the original films has not grown in to a wise\\, experienced Jedi Master\\, ready to impart the knowledge of the Jedi to one who is worthy. Instead\\, he has become a quirky old guy called Mark Hamill\\, who is perpetually grumpy about being the last jedi. Also\\, unlike Luke Skywalker\\, who refused to strike his fallen Father down because he sensed a shred of good in him\\, this guy was tempted to kill his nephew in his sleep because he sensed a growing darkness within him. \\n\\nThis is where the movie transgresses a line the prequels never did or could. It has unwritten the original trilogy. It has diminished the legacy of some of the greatest films of all time\\, stories that are embedded in our cultural DNA. Worse\\, Rian Johnson did so deliberately. The burning of the tree containing the ancient Jedi texts was no coincidence\\, but deliberate symbolism for what the film was intended to be.","true":true}
