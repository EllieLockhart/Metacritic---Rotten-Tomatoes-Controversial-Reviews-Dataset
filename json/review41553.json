Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie left me in shock.  I was worried when Disney took over\\, worried that their infamously soulless corporate entertainment machine would plop out Star Wars flavored garbage once every two years until every body was sick to death of the franchise.  I was worried that they would turn Star Wars into the Marvel franchise\\, a series of cynical money-grabs whose main purpose was to fill seats and sell merchandise rather than tell a meaningful story.  I was worried that I would watch Star Wars die.\\n\\nBut then The Force Awakens came out\\, and it was ok.  Not great\\, but also not terrible.  It felt like they at least tried to keep the spirit of Star Wars alive\\, to link up with the larger living universe of the franchise and contribute in a meaningful way to the ongoing canon that decades of viewers\/readers\/players have enjoyed and contributed to.\\n\\nAnd then this movie happened.  This awful\\, turgid\\, shat-out\\, cookie-cutter Disney-fied waste of film stock.  This movie is shameless clone of the modern Disney movie formula with a thin veneer of Star Wars stretched grotesquely over it.  This movie is Thor Ragnarok with a lightsaber.  It's Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in an X-wing.\\n\\nForget decades of world building and characterization\\, that stuff is for nerds!  Now we've got millenial cringe-humor\\, goofy slapstick and a vague message about the one percenters!  Oh\\, you wanted some recognition of the beloved stories that have come before?  Well too bad dorkasaurus\\, that geek crap didn't test well with our focus groups at all!  Coherent plots and meaningful canons are a thing of the past\\, broseph!  Today's movies are all about stringing together a series of dumb popular-brand-flavored comedy sketches that people will remember and talk about later\\, because that appeals to an extremely wide audience!\\n\\nI hate this movie.  I hate everything it represents.  I hate the incessant dumbing down of modern movies.   I hate watching stories I care about in the hands of an evil corporate entity whose only job is to make money.  The Star Wars I loved is dead.  All that's left now is a sock puppet made from its gutted corpse.","true":true}
