Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally a Star Wars movie with a daring script\\, this is an excellent movie\\, not only a good Star Wars. The choices of the characters are the core focus and the action\\, although spectacular\\, is only a complement to genuinely gripping drama.","true":true}
