Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No...just no.  I call it a waste of $100 to take the family.  Little kids 10 and under might really like it.  But for everyone else save your cash and rent it or buy the BluRay.\\n\\nI just wanted to add that I did just create this account (first time every doing this) to post my dissatisfaction with this movie.  I'm not a troll or bot or part of some group trying to take this movie down.  It's just not a very good move and spits in the face of its vast history.\\n\\nIf there is a E9 and Disney keeps down this path it will end up being one their worst investments\\, because people will not blindly buy what they're selling.  \\n\\nI know several people who had to go see it 2x times just to see if it was as bad as they thought.  So again the user reviews are true and have nothing to do with the boat load of money this will make.\\n\\nFor the record I will not be going to see the Solo film.  I'm done after 40 years of SW going to the movies if this is quality that I'm being sold.\\n\\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EIY-PsHrj9A","true":true}
