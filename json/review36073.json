Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi took risks and made choices that most movies with such an established history don't have the confidence to do. This has resulted in one of the more\\, if not the most compelling installment in the greatest series to grace the silver screen. \\n\\nAs a lifelong fan\\, it was amazing to see something that surprised at every turn. It evoked the same feeling as getting to see the universe for the first time.\\n\\nIt brings the magic. It brings it hard.","true":true}
