Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone who sees this movie needs to go in with an open mind. Yes\\, TLJ takes a lot of risks. And yes\\, the plot could\u2019ve been a bit stronger and well-rounded. But it was an extremely enjoyable and satisfying entry into the Star Wars canon.","true":true}
