I loved heavy rain and beyond two souls and I knew what I was getting into when I got this game unlike some ppl who just pick it up without any knowledge.

Maybe the sales will be good enough to spawn a sequel or more games like this. I loved heavy rain and beyond two souls and I knew what I was getting into when I got this game unlike some ppl who just pick it up without any knowledge. The game itself is fantastic and I haven't beat it yet but the story\\, characters\\, and graphics are top tier. Even though this game pays homage to 90s horror I took it way more seriously and unlike most horror movies\\, actually cared for the characters. The choices in this\\, much like telltale's series  of games\\, actually matter here. You choose who will live and die it's entirely up to the player. You are director in this horror movie and can change the plot on a whim. Some choices won't show up till later but when **** hits the fan it hits HARD. I think all horror fans who grew up loving cheesy 90s cliche horror will LOVE this game and it deserves it. We need more games like these out there and supermassive with their impressive beautiful talent at creating tension\\, dread\\, death and beauty in this world of consequence\\, need to seriously make horror games in the future. The only downside I had was the length\\, it seemed short to me but is replay able since you won't understand the full story being told on the first play through. Supermassive have a sleeper hit on their hands and now that the game is out it's time to revel in this magnificent horror experience 9.5\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
