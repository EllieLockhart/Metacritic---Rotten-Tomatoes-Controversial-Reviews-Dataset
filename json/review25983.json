Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing will ever replace the nostalgia of growing up with Episode 4\\, 5 and 6. That said\\, I have let all those presumptions go and settled into enjoy the new movies. They are fun\\, I'm getting more into the new characters and I thoroughly enjoy myself. Not perfect\\, but with a good crowd\\, cheers\\, claps and hollers\\, it was fun. I recommend it and will continue to see more.","true":true}
