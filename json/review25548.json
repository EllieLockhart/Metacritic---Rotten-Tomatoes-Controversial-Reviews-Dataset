Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nostalgia is officially over\\, I am done with Star Wars.  Special effects desperately attempt to compensate for poor story\/script\/characters.  Disney destroys the movie franchise\\, just as EA destroys the gaming franchise.","true":true}
