{"101487":121310,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all i have removed more than 90% of the critics from my personal list\\, as I feel they are giving paid reviews. Shame on you for giving such reviews and shame on you for doing this job.\\n\\nI am not a star wars fan\\, I have always thought Star Wars was overrated \\, but i do understand its importance in the 20th century and i respect it for it. \\n\\nThe movie has an amazing soundtrack and sound editing and stunning visual effects \\, and some actors do a phenomenal job with what they were given. Thats all the good stuff about this movie\\, now the bad.\\n\\n-So many plot holes\\, the movie makes up stuff along the way in order to give screen time\\, like the casino scene( I know some will say the movie is about failure \\,but that part of the movie was so bad. Casually landing on the beach\\, walking in dressed as rebels in the most rich city in the galaxy\\, some animal abuse\\, casually meeting ANOTHER code breaker in prison who happens to be there at that same time etc etc)\\n-Leia flying in vacuum\\, like merry popins? shes substituted with a purple hair holdo\\, who decides to keep her plans to herself (Why not share with her ace fighter????) mutiny by Poe which was forgiven in seconds??? Holdo sacrifacing herself even though there are like 100 androids on that ship??\\nAnd what was the point of the first movie? I have no idea why they even made TFA if snoke doesn't matter\\, Rey family doesn't matter\\, Phasma doesn't matter... they throw in an asian girl just for the lols??? I mean what was that kiss at the end between her and Finn\\, 0 romantic tension between them and she gives a kiss but ok. Now shes dead\\, oh wait no shes just sleeping??? And on and on\\, every single scene is ridiculous \\n\\n-The humor: I mean honestly \\, who wrote the script\\, its cheesy and pointless\\, the movie feels like it has 0 seriousness but deals with failure????. I dont know where you guys watched the movie\\, but after leaving my cinema almost every kid in there was like well that movie was boring\\, i even saw people leave during the movie... Luke milking the animal was supposed to be funny???? Since when is milking animals funny\\,its essential to our civilization...\\n\\n-The complete carnage of luke skywalker character: I never liked Luke skywalker as a character \\, but honestly i have never seen a director and writers do such a bad job. The guy saves the galaxy \\,goes through hell and back\\, but one small child escapes his temple and he loses his shit? what the actual f...\\n\\nThis movie was not a sensory experience like Dunkirk \\, nor did it have a good story. Chasing the ship for 18h with 3-4 First Order ships\\, where are the other ships\\,is 3-4 ships all the FO has ?!? I know its sci fi\\, but tracking through speed of light\\, is time travel itself; luke projecting his body over thousands of light years\\, Rey beats Luke in battle like he was no one. Bah \\,i want my money back at least\\, because i cant get the time i spent watching this pathetic excuse of a movie. \\n\\nOnce again\\, im not a fan and i feel betrayed \\, i cant imagine what the fans are thinking right now...","true":true}
