Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hardly know where to begin. The horrid pacing\\, the lack of plot\\, leaving questions unanswered\\, trying to do a soft reboot of Empire only in reverse order?   This was an awful movie in and of itself\\, even if you don't examine it as a piece of a larger work.Disney\\,   Please please please either go the full Star Trek alternate timeline route if you want beloved characters acting completely out of character or just write stories that are in the Star Wars universe but have minimal connection to the originals. For love of Yoda just pick one or the other.","true":true}
