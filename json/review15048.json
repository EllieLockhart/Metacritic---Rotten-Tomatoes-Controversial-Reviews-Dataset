Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left a review of this movie when it first came out. I don't understand why my review is not in the list of movies I reviewed so I will try again. I heard that if you give a movie 1\/2 a star it is not counted. \\nSo I will try again. \\nI am a HUGE life long Star Wars fan. As a kid waiting for the news Star Wars movie to come out was like waiting a lifetime. With the prequels\\, I mostly liked them. They were Star Wars to me\\, even though I felt they had so many cringe worthy scenes. \\nI liked the Force Awakens. It had some issues but I liked it. But I actually hated this movie. For me to say I hated a Star Wars movie says a lot to anyone who knows me. The story\\, the characters (I liked the new characters the force awakens) \\, the breaking from all the rules of Star Wars was so bad I am blown away. But it was what they did to Luke Skywalker was unforgivable.","true":true}
