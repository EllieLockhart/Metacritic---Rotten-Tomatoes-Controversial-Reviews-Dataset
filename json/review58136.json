Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow!!!! All I can say is wow. I was super pumped for this movie. I felt J.J. set Rian Johnson up really well to develop the story line of the Last Jedi. Nope didn't happen\\, plot was crap\\, character development was crap\\, Rose wtf is she even in the movie for\\, Leia damn didn't know she could fly in space and be like Superman. Like wtf...happened\\, Snoke uh who cares about his backstory\\, Kylo I think the only power he has is being a lil bitch\\, overall too long of a movie and a piece of crap film in my opinion the worst in franchise history. I loved the prequels (episode 1 was ok but the other 2 were great)\\, love the original series\\, Rogue and The Force Awakens. I purposely openned up an account to share my true disgust for this film.","true":true}
