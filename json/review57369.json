Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie picks up from where The Force Awakens ends and it goes full throttle from there. Finn\\, Rey and Poe each take their own journey post the traumatic battle of Starkiller Base and the lives that were lost there. I thought that I knew what their journeys would entail\\, but I was pretty much completely wrong. The character growth shown by all three characters is astounding\\, and even more surprisingly the new secondary characters and even the tertiary characters have excellent moments and motivations as well. Without spoiling anything\\, the plot twists\\, backstories and the battles in this movie had me cheering aloud\\, gasping for breath\\, and sitting on the edge of my seat. I went in wondering where they could have taken things after The Force Awakens\\, and now I find myself thinking that it is going to be a very long two years till the 9th episode comes out. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill of course have to have a shoutout\\, and I really liked seeing where these characters were at this point in their lives... and I once again feel completely heartbroken that we won't get to see the initial version of what had been envisioned for Leia now that Carrie Fisher has passed. All in all\\, I give it a four  and a half out of five rating. It was good\\, well put together but I'm never a fan of the middle of a trilogy\\, which is why I can't give it five stars.","true":true}
