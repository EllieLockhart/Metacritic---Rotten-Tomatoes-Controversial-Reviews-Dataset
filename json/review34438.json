Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars episode ever tied with \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\". Rian Johnson knows how to make a film and deliver a story. Looking forward to his next Star Wars trilogy.","true":true}
