Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far and beyond the worst movie in the entire franchise. The irredeemable flaws and huge problems are detailed in the literally THOUSANDS of negative reviews on here\\, so he need to go into that detail\\, let's just say that it's very badly written\\, very badly executed hogwash with uncomfortably liberal bias thrown together with sjw pandering\\, where canonical characters we've known for 30-40 years are killed off for no reason whatsoever\\, the entire tone of intense scenes is ruined with awful\\, clumsy humor and jokes\\, and to end it\\, Luke Skywalker dies for no reason whatsoever. \\n\\nDo not bother with this movie. Star Wars is not what it was for the past 40 years... Disney has ruined it. Rogue one was reasonably good. force awakens was acceptable because it was lazy\\, but it had potential. The last Jedi is a complete and total insult to people that grew up watching the original 6 movies\\, and disrespectful to the entire saga's direction and vision.","true":true}
