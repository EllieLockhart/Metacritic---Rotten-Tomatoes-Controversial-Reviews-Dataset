Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"After many years of work and the long time between the games\\, I had expected to see a masterpiece but what I got was a burning pile of **** The gameplay is still just as good as the original and the graphics are just as good.

I had sat through the whole game and after it was over\\, I was very confused about what had naught dog was thinking. With killing off the main character just for shock\\, and then letting the murderer's walk was a waste of an amazing chance to make Ellie shine in a way that wasn't possible in the original. The characters are shallow with no depth. After this entire time and my 80 dollars for a pre-order\\, I could not be more pissed off at this game and the developers. I have played games that were free\\, that had better storylines and character development.  Please do not waste your time and money like I did.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
