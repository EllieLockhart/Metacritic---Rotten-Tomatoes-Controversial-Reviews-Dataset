Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, I was really impressed by Rogue One. This was a mess- poor writing\\, poor humor\\, and pretty much exactly the opposite of the \\\"critics consensus\\\" summary. NOT honoring the saga's rich legacy\\, NOT emotion- rich action\\, NOT all fans could hope for. In fact I don't know how but somehow Disney have taken all they achieved with The Force Awakens and broken it. It's like genius but the opposite of that.","true":true}
