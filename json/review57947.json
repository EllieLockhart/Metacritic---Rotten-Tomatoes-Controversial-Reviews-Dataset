Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What should have been a follow up to the FANTASTIC Force Awakens turns out to be a stand alone film that does its own thing\\, very\\, very\\, very badly.\\n\\nWho the hell was Snoke? How did he seduce Kylo to the dark side? How was he killed by Kylo so damn easily? Where did Maz Katana get Luke\/Anakin's blue lightsaber from after it fell in Cloud City in Empire Strikes Back? Who were the Knights of Ren?\\n\\nLleast favourite part? So hard to choose because there were so many!\\nBB8 inside the walker\\, Leia Poppins and Luke's humiliating death scene are all runners up. But I think it was actually the sIave kids at the end. It felt so out of place and random!","true":true}
