Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a series of cheap\\, sometimes interesting visuals and dramatic tension\\, but it's like spray painting dog poo. You can accent it with color and trick the casual viewer for a second\\, but if you spend anytime looking at it you will see it for what it truly is\\, a steaming pile poo and disrespectful and shameless attempt to profit from fans like some cheap suckers. This film is incoherent and vacuous of compelling plot and characters overall.","true":true}
