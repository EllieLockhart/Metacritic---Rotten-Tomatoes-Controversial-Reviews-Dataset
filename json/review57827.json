Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was the Last Jedi a perfect movie? Hardly. But what Star Wars movie has been?  I believe most of the hate on this film comes from folks who are overthinking the movie\\, and imagining the series to have some perfectly cohesive plot without holes in it's story telling. Let's be real\\, this movie was great. As good as the last one? No. But definitely better than Return of the Jedi. Sure\\, the movie ran a tad long\\, and the casino bit was a tad bit unnecessary and unimaginative. But overall\\, this movie works on a number of different levels\\, and most importantly it moves the story along just nicely\\, and sets us up nicely for the next movie.  The characters in this series of Star Wars movies really get a chance to further grow as characters\\, and we get to see more complexity to all the main players... except perhaps Fen. But Fen isn't really all that necessary anymore. The person who Luke\\, Ray\\, and Kylo Ren becomes are much more important to this story.","true":true}
