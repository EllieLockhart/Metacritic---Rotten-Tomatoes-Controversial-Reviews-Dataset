I know this because (1) I completed the game over the weekend and (2) my wife was as engaged in watching me play it as I was. As a (now) casual gamer married to a woman who hates video games these two things never happen. ISure\\, this can hardly be called a \\\"video game\\\" as that term has been defined over the last 30 years\\, but whatever the hell you call it\\, it was a wonderful experience. I know this because (1) I completed the game over the weekend and (2) my wife was as engaged in watching me play it as I was. As a (now) casual gamer married to a woman who hates video games these two things never happen. I suppose that says more about how this experience is not a video game than anything else\\, but video games are evolving and I suppose this will be a case study on that point.\r\rUnfortunately\\, the thing most likely to kill you in this otherwise tense experience are its first 2.5 hours. This part of the game just moved too slowly and the scares had no substance to them. As a fan of the horror genre\\, that \u201cthing lurking in the shadows\u201d can only turn out to be a harmless **** so many times before I stop taking you seriously. This isn\u2019t to say that the scares should commence right out the gate\\, but too many false starts are what nearly caused me to put the controller down on this one forever. If the creators want to lull me into a false sense of security before unleashing the proverbial beast\\, I would appreciate it if they were quicker about it next time. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad in a game where you can do more than walk at a snail\u2019s pace\\, but with the exception of its set pieces\\, that\u2019s really all you can do here. This has the effect of forcing you to endure 2-3 hours of slow\\, uneventful \u201cgameplay\u201d through the introductory chapters. I'm too damn busy to spend all that time doing nothing.\r\rAnother gripe I had is that when you are in control of them\\, the players can never move faster than a slow amble. If you hold down the L1 button you go from moving at 1 mile per hour to moving at 1.2 miles per hour. However\\, the game rewards exploration\\, possibly more so than any game I have ever played. This sends mixed messages by encouraging you to check every corner of every environment\\, but also making it frustrating to walk your character's slow ass across the room. This frustration is exacerbated when the characters have to explore some of the larger locales. The experience would have been much better if you could at least jog. This would have allowed me to get through the game\u2019s slower moments without sacrificing the tension I am sure the developers were trying to achieve with the whole walking thing. I\u2019m left wondering why the creators of the game even gave you the option of \u201cwalking faster\u201d by holding L1\\, when there was no meaningful difference in the character\u2019s pace.\r\rNotwithstanding the above\\, there are many things I found in this game that I want to see in future video games. The setting is fantastic and the graphics are incredible. The game is just amazing to look at. I also appreciate how the choices you make have consequences that the game forces you to live with. The game is constantly saving\\, so if a decision you made results in a character\u2019s death\\, or leaves the character without a weapon\\, you have to move forward with that. What made this feature so interesting is that the consequences of your decisions are not always readily apparent: sometimes the consequence of a decision you made much earlier in the game does not manifest itself until the game\u2019s final chapters\\, when the **** really hits the fan. Another quality I found interesting is that the choices I made did not always turn out the way I would have expected.\r\rDespite what I am reading in other reviews: the story and characters are brilliant. Reviewers are complaining that the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes to which I say two things: (1) no\\, they aren\u2019t really\\, and (2) so what? On that first point\\, the characters definitely start out as stereotypes\\, but they (and how you feel about them) will change based on the decisions you make. At one point early in the game\\, you rank the characters based on how you feel about them. Naturally\\, I made my choices based on the things I had observed up to that point. As the game progressed however\\, the way I felt about certain characters changed dramatically. I have never had an emotional attachment to video game characters quite like I did in this game.  By the end of the game\\, each character was a byproduct of the decisions I had personally made.  So\\, if you played the game and still think that the characters are stereotypes\\, then perhaps that says more about you than the characters themselves.\r\rLastly\\, I prefer conventional video games where the interactivity aspect manifests itself more in the gameplay and less in player decisions. I hated Beyond Two Souls and the minute I learned that this game was going to be much like that gameplay-wise I was seriously off-put. In fact\\, I un-preordered Until Dawn and did not buy it. Instead\\, I rented it and I am damn glad I gave it a shot because when the developers address its issues in future games\\, I am looking forward to giving them my money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
