Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was a real hero! He came off to me as introspective and questioning the correctness of all he had done and the Jedi order. Luke had seen his dreams and beliefs turn to crap and had lost faith in the specialness of the Jedi. However\\, he gained faith in the universality of the force. He was humbled and thus empowered by life. So interesting that so many find this version of the heroes journey unacceptable. They want only the super hero delusion where there is only blind courage and action. This was a more mature and real version of a courageous man. In the end he gave his life for Rey\\, just as Obi Wan did for him when he was a boy. Great movie and one of the best Star Wars yet. ","true":true}
