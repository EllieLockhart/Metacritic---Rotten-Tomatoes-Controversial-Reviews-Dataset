Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad dialogue! When you have bad dialogue the the acting is going to suffer. It was like watching a hammed up version of a badly written Shakespearean play. I test human interaction for web and apps and quantify frustrations\\, likes\\, wants and needs. Was this film shown to a test audience? I can tell you exactly at what point this film lost it's audience but for spoiler reasons I won't. Everybody I went with and talked to had the same opinion without me saying anything. I'm not a SW geek by any means and had no preconceived theories before going into this\\, it is just a poorly written and acted movie. Kudos to the special effects crew\\, as always\\, a well done job","true":true}
