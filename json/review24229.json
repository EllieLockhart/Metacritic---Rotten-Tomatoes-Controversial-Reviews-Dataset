Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"meh. my friend fell asleep during it\\, she isnt a SW fan but enjoys sci fi. And as a HUGE SW fan I was greatly disappointed. No passion\\, annoying new noisy characters\\, ruining old characters....man\\, I got that nauseous feeling I had 3\/4 through Phantom Menace while asking myself \\\"Man\\, is this it?\\\". At least PM had Darth maul light saber duel at the end which left me with a smile and some hope\\, but this? Probably worse or second worse SW movie....","true":true}
