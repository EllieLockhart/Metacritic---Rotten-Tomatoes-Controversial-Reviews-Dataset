Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks but No thanks. the character assassination of Luke Skywalker Rian Johnson calls a movie is not recognized by me as part of the canon. \\\"luke skywalker tried to do what to his teenaged nephew? he said WHAT about Darth Vader?\\\" \\\" that never happened silly. i dont know what youre talking about\\\" its much easier to sink into denial than acknowledge this horseshit part of canon. I'd take JJ abrams Museum Tour the Original Trilogy otherwise Known as the Force Awakens before this garbage. I actually LIKED the original Trilogy. Dearest JJ Abrams\\,  if  you want to rehash it\\, remake it\\, redo it\\, twist it\\, turn it\\, bring it into a modern 1990's Saved By the Bell -esque Alternate Universe remake. please by all means do it. Just dont do whatever the hell it is Rian Johnson did.","true":true}
