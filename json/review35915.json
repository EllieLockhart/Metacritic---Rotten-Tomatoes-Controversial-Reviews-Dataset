Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie.\\n\\nHere is just some reasons why:\\n- all style over substance\\n- all subversion over substance\\n- bad or misplaced humor\\n- numerous plot holes\\n- pointless new characters and side story\\n- destroys Luke character\\n- nearly no character growth\\n- ignores most setups from ep 7\\n- everything feels so anticlimactic\\n\\nSome say it has gone to bold new direction\\, but at the end we are again left with empire vs. rebels...\\n\\nWhat a disappointment.","true":true}
