Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, absolutely terrible. A disgrace\\, a travesty\\, utterly nauseating. This stupid trash needs to be erased from history. Kathleen Kennedy and Ruin Johnson ought to be blacklisted from Hollywood for such a disgusting SJW NPC propaganda piece. Done with Disney Star Wars for good- it's officially over.","true":true}
