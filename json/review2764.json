Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, just plain awful! \\n\\nWhat a piece of ju....shite\\, absolute shite! The worst Star Wars film by a country mile!! The Force Awakens is a masterpiece compared to this dross! Even the prequels look good next to this mistake of a Star Wars film! Unsatisfying conclusions! Snoke?!?! Snoke\\, I'll say it again Snoke! Fingers crossed Kylo and use the force behind your back\\, no one will ever know! Leia flying through space like a cardboard cut out! Luke what have they turned you into!?! And the rest of them well I couldn't careless! Finn acting like he's an intergalactic Chris Tucker\\, Rey or Daisy Ridley I should say terrible acting! General Hux who just seems to now be a baffoon \\, even bb-8 taking out bad guys driving scout walkers! And the plethora of women who seem to make up the resistance! Casinos with Star Trek cast offs and the main crux of the movie chasing a slow moving ship for the entirety of said film! All finished off with slap stick comedy\\, e.g. Luke throwing his lightsaber over his shoulder \/ prank phone calls and yes Hux. How can Rogue one be so right and this be so wrong?!","true":true}
