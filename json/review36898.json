Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Movie was entertaining to say the least\\, but it wasn't a fitting SW's movie for a die hard fan!  Here is why... **Spoliers**: Beware...                                           \\nNO back story on Snoke then he dies\\,... what\\, why?  No Epicness from Luke other than Force projecting himself across the Galaxy\\, then dying! WTF!  Rey's maybe 2 day\\, and 2 total lessons of Training\\, huh!  Rebel Bombers that moved like Molasses\\, seriously how do you blow anything up going that slow\\, and not wrapping up Carrie Fishers untimely death into the Leah character arc to say a few... Will she be all CGI in Ep 9 or die offscreen?   The plot was wonky\\, and the dialogue was a bit flat.  The action was good\\, and it was a visually nice film\\, but it lacked that Empire Strikes Back epic revelation and awe that it deserved!","true":true}
