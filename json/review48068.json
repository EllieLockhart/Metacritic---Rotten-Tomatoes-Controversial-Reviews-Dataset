Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the anticipation for this movie was massive\\, I don't feel it lives up to the hype. While it has its moments\\, such as the business with Luke\\, nothing really stands out about this film. It seemed to drag on for quite some time\\, and discards all original trilogy characters in favor of the new ones. While \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" got me excited for the new chapters in the Star Wars legacy\\, this movie left me wanting much more\\, and dreading future installments.","true":true}
