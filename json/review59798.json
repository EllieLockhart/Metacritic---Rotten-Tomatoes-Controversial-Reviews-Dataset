Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Horrible game. The story just ruins everything for me. How can you spend 6 years making a game and you don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re making an awful story. 4 people write this story. 4. What a joke. A 5 year old would have wrote a better story. First\\, you kill Joel\\, the most likeable character of TLOU1. Then they make us play with her killer\\, and not only that but they try to make us sympathize with her. What the hell were they thinking? Like no one cares about her\\, and her \u201credemption\u201d story. Abby\u2019s character is poorly written too like the whole game. I\u2019ve never seen a person change her whole mindset in 48 hours. It\u2019s unbelievably poor. Cheap and lazy writing.Then...none of the characters are likeable\\, not a single one. The only likeable left was Tommy and they didn\u2019t give the importance that he deserved\\, and then at the end of the story he just disappears like he was no one.The new characters and their sub-stories are really boring and they\u2019re just an excuse to make the game longer. The ending is one of the worst endings I\u2019ve seen in my life. The whole story never makes sense\\, like Abby and Ellie kill a bunch of people that have nothing to do with them but when they can kill each other to get their \u201crevenges\u201d\\, all of a sudden they get all pacifist and let each other live. It\u2019s not the story about revenge or what? What kind of **** \u201crevenge\u201d is that?What bothers me the most is people trying to bring deep thoughs or get into the psychology of the characters to justify that the story is good. The story is anything but deep. It\u2019s a plain story that\u2019s been told many times before\\, but very poorly executed. Go play GTAIV and you will see what a good revenge game is.A story that is not believable within the game's own logic will never be a good story. TLOU2 has a lousy story that is filled with bad decisions and executions. I give a 1 out of 10 to the story. Despite all the love I have for the first game\\, this one seems like it\u2019s not a sequel at any time and is an insult to the original story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
