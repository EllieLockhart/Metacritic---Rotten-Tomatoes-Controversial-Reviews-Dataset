Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not sure what the critics saw in this film. It was too long\\, with questionable character motivation\\, and superfluous scenes. The humor felt forced. And several plot points did not make a whole lot of sense. The entire film had the feeling of a remake instead of a bold new adventure\\, like Rogue One.","true":true}
