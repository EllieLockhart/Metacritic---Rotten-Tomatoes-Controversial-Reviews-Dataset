{"101487":169239,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT\\nI'm not gonna do a review. I'm gonna actually defend the movie against the annoying haters.\\nI'm gonna start with this premise\\, the difference between a smart critic and a dumb one.\\nThe smart one no matter how much he hates what he criticizes\\, he points out all the bad things and if he is really smart\\, he is gonna find something good to point out even if the thing he is criticizing is 100% bad.\\nThe idiot critic criticizes only by saying: \\n\\\"i hated it\\\"\\n\\\"IT SUCKS\\\"\\n\\\"Ridiculous\\\"\\n\\\"can it get worse?\\\" ETC.\\nNo arguments\\, and IF there is any argument\\, the arguments can be shortened by a simple \\\"It wasn't the way i wanted it to be. So it sucked\\\" \\nAnd these are the ones that i see criticizing the movie. Who does that? The infamous and hated haters.\\nI saw ONE guy pointing out the things that he didn't like and i'm gonna debunk them\\, and i feel like this is an unanimous among the people who didn't like the movie BUT... i could be wrong. So here it goes.\\n1-They dismissed Rey's origins- Did this guy watch the movie? Didn't he hear that Rey's parents were alcoholics that sold her to buy more drinks? He might have meant that they ignored a different origin in the expanded universe\\, and now i ask\\, since when do they have to answer to the expanded universe? They broke the expanded universe by giving han and leia a divorce and only 1 kid. And the guy didn't complain about it.\\n2-Who is snoke and where does he come from? -Not only they still have 1 episode to explain that\\, (his death doesn't make them unable to explain that) but also they might not even explain that and there are many things that they probabbly are never gonna explain.\\n3-Where are the grey jedi? -Ok\\, again... They can still introduce that. So what that the movie didn't have what you wanted? That doesn't change the quality of the movie. There was never one single grey jedi in the movies and they didn't need it to make good star wars movies.\\n4-Rey didn't become a grey jedi. OH BOO HOO! The movie didn't have something i wanted it to have so it suked. Boo hoo. For your information i also would love to see her becoming a grey jedi. And i didn't\\, and i still liked because i don't expect the movie to be the way i want it to be. I would also love to see them introducing a new lightsaber color (specially the white)\\, but they didn't\\, and i'm not hating the movie for that.\\n5-Luke was too weak. -He was emocinally broken\\, alone\\, old and tired. If you didn't see that... And he also did something never seen by any jedi master before\\, his master troll against his nephew\\, is he really a weak jedi?\\n6-Where are the Knights of ren?- They still have a movie to explain that man\\, u can't expect all the questions to be answered in a two and a half hours movie\\, and some questions might never be answered. Many of the original trilogy weren't also and no one complained.\\nI can simply say that the guy only didn't like the movie because he would only like it if it went the way he wanted it to (something clearly seen in the points 2\\,3\\, 4 and 6\\, he didn't like it because he was frustraded because didn't happen what he wanted to see). Since it wasn't he hated it. And i'm sure that many of the people who didn't like it are like that.","true":true}
