Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It started out great. The middle of the movie (2nd Act) was pretty weak. I think they could\u2019ve easily trimmed 20 mins off of it and still had the point\/premise come across. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) What\u2019s up with the \u201cForce FaceTime\u201d? Really? Although\\, seeing Kylo Ren shirtless...Woof. And remind me not to run low on gas with the First Order behind me. That was lame\/weak story-writing. But overall\\, I liked it and found it very thought-provoking as far as the purpose of \u201cThe Force\u201d and many other themes (trying to avoid spoilers). The conclusion (3rd Act) saves it.","true":true}
