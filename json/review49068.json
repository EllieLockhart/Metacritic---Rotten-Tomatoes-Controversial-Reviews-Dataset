Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever!!!! Complete rubbish.Disney you should be ashamed of yourself\\, this movie was a complete disgrace and a slap in the face to every Star Wars fan\\, you will never be forgiven for this!!!\\nIf I could travel back in time and NOT see this movie I would","true":true}
