{"101487":129413,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am another reviewer who created an account just to add my thoughts\\, as I don't believe some of the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I am a Star Wars fan and a Disney fan\\, and I cannot imagine how this version of Star Wars made it to theaters.  I won't go into details about weaknesses of the film\\, but I encourage you to read the longer reviews other viewers have provided.  You can read the highs and lows of the movie in those reviews-though you will have to search awhile for positive reviews that actually provide specifics.  For the record\\, I gave it two stars for the music and special effects.\\n\\nHow did the many and varied Disney teams involved in this\\, from start to finish\\, allow this film to be completed?  I can think of few companies who treasure their brand (and accompanying brand loyalty) more than Disney.  Who thought this movie was a good idea?  How did the decision makers stamp their approval on a film that further damages the heroes and ideals from the original trilogy?  I get that Luke Skywalker didn't have the formal Jedi training referred to in the prequels\\, so I accept that he is a flawed and imperfect character and Jedi.  That he would feel the urge to carry out a wicked act\\, even if for the briefest of moments\\, does not align with the character we loved from the original movies.  That the object of that act is the son of both his sister and his old friend also doesn't align with his character\\, someone who was able to redeem his own father from the dark side.  I understand that the years since ROTJ may not have been rosy and that the Luke in this movie is an older and far less na\u00efve one than the younger one\\, but this film takes that too far.  As one reviewer already noted\\, we \\\"lost\\\" Han in the previous episode: the lonely smuggler who became a revolutionary hero in the original trilogy ended up being a lonely smuggler again just prior to his death.  In this new film\\, we now lose Luke\\, the once optimistic Jedi now an embittered one.  I did not need to see him wield his lightsaber in battle in this movie and save the universe; I get that he had his heyday and that this new trilogy is to allow the new heroes to shine.  But why go to such lengths to nearly destroy this beloved character?\\n\\nThis is why I'm so surprised that Disney allowed this movie to be made.  Kill off the old characters and showcase the new ones\\, but don't destroy the spirit and fond memories of the old ones!  Can you imagine Disney making a Toy Story sequel in which Buzz fails in his relationship with Jessie and ends up a lonely space smuggler while Woody ends up a cynical recluse who wants just to die?  Can you imagine Disney allowing a sequel to Peter Pan that has an aging and enraged Peter pondering killing one of the Lost Boys who might join Captain Hook?  Can you imagine Disney greenlighting a sequel to Aladdin in which our happy hero becomes radicalized in the Arabian peninsula\\, disgusted by the wealth and greed of being a prince and later sultan\\, and joins ISIS (\\\"I can show you the world...except America...death to America!')?   NO\\, NO\\, and NO!  I do not understand the need to completely undermine the legacy characters\\, as if the original trilogy meant nothing.  It's as if Disney is so annoyed THEY didn't think of Star Wars in the first place\\, with all the unforgettable characters and the fortunes made from toys and merchandise\\, that they decided to invalidate that original trilogy.  Why not just continue to reap the benefits from those originals while adding new characters?  Why the need to middle-finger us fans?  I saw in FORBES that THE LAST JEDI broke a box office record: \\\"biggest sequel-to-sequel plunge.\\\"  That has to get the Disney bean counters' and shareholders' attention.\\nI also read today that this movie has underperformed in China where it recently opened and where audiences don't have the history and affection for the original movies.  So moviegoers not so connected to the original trilogy aren't enthralled with this movie (it's not just us traditional fans!).\\n\\nWhereas my brother and I received Star Wars toys for Christmas all those years ago\\, this year my nephew and niece received a simple stocking stuffer each (small Kylo and Rey action figures)\\, and the novelty of those toys wore off very quickly.  The kids were more interested in my old Darth Vader and Millennium Falcon ornaments!  (As a side note\\, at the store I found the Rey figures at the back of the rack\\, behind a dozen clearly unwanted figures of Rose.  So how popular is that character?)  This is what I mean by brand.  How much in sales has Disney missed\\, not only in repeat theater visits\\, but in merchandising?  While the new characters were engaging and interesting in THE FORCE AWAKENS\\, very little of that carries over in THE LAST JEDI.  So I imagine fewer people were excited about the new characters' merchandise this season\\, and I'm sure the collectors my age were not the least interested in the Luke-drinks-slime action figure to place on the shelf next to the Luke-with-lighsaber and Luke-as-rebel-pilot originals.\\n\\nWhile I'm at this\\, I might as well agree with so many of the other reviewers who've commented on the absurd level of girl power in this movie.  I knew in the previous movie that times had changed and that a female main character was overdue\\, and I was intrigued by Rey.  What happened in this new film\\, though?  It continually vomits its overexaggerated feminism on the audience.  Look\\, I took my niece\\, my sister\\, and my mother to see WONDER WOMAN last year\\, and we all very much enjoyed it.  But this movie goes overboard in making sure you see again and again that women have the power.  Combine that aspect with the absolute waste of time that is the Finn and Rose excursion\\, and you have a film that unsubtly preaches way too much.  I get it: people with money sometimes spend it on expensive luxuries that not everyone can afford.  I mean\\, those slot machines in the casino scene were taking in money faster than Disneyland ticket booths.\\n\\nAnd while I'm on Finn and Rose\\, what a disservice to those characters and to diversity this movie was.  Neither character was good and neither was bad.  Finn was a rehash from the last movie-ambivalent about whether he's a \\\"good guy\\\" or not.  We thought that was resolved with his heroics in the forest scene of the previous film\\, but here he is again.  It's difficult to get behind this guy when he waffles between retreating again or helping to save the Resistance.  And then there's Rose.  Another wasted opportunity.  Give that character (and Finn) a more significant storyline instead of being our Jiminy Cricket guide through the Pleasure Island scenes in Canto Bight.  Are there too many women leading the Resistance part of the movie\\, which left no room for Rose to do something useful?  Rose\\, like her heroic sister did\\, should've had more of a positive impact.  Instead she goes with Finn on an adventure that takes the movie nowhere except over the 2.5-hour mark.\\n\\nI hate that I didn't like this movie.  I liked the prequels\\, for heaven's sake\\, so it takes a lot for me not to like a Star Wars movie.  Unfortunately THE LAST JEDI is the first movie to make that happen.  From disappointing treatment of a beloved character\\, to disappointing treatment of new characters\\, to overtreatment of female characters\\, this film left me feeling...disappointed.  This whole thing started 40 years ago with A NEW HOPE\\, and I'm thinking the next movie should be named THE LAST HOPE.","true":true}
