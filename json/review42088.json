Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie plays with your expectations of what a Star Wars movie is \u201csupposed\u201d to be. You think you know what to expect and then it does something else. It takes chances that largely pay off. The characters are not just the same characters we\u2019ve all already seen. It\u2019s a different take on the same story without just being a rehash of what has been done before. Long story short This is a good Star Wars","true":true}
