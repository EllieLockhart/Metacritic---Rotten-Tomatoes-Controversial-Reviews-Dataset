Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loves Star Wars as a child\\, and even more as an adult. They say if you live long enough\\, you'll see the things you love die. Such is the case for Star Wars. Star Wars is dead. Disney killed it. I'll never watch another Star Wars movie again.","true":true}
