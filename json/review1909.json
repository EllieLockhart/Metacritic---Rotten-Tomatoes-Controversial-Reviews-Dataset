Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As i read the critics reviews i wonder if we were watching the same movie . This was awful . Its the 1st time iv watched a Star Wars movie and not enjoyed it . Rey\\, Finn and Poe are poor characters. Kylo Ren is the least intimidating villain and the movie is crammed full of cringey jokes with poor timing. I just can't see how JJ can fix this mess when it comes to making episodes. 9","true":true}
