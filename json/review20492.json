Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid.  I gave TFA a lot of slack because I thought there would be some sort of payoff.  This movie failed to deliver\\, and for the first time in my life I can truly say I am not looking forward to the next Star Wars movie.\\nPositives : Looked pretty\\, soundtrack was okay.\\nNegatives : Poor writing\/direction.","true":true}
