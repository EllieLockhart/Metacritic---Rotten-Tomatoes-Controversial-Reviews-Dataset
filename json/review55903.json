Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reposting to increase to 1 full star so my 1\/2 star original vote will count for something.\\nHere's  how the trailer made me feel: I'm walking up to Rian Johnson who has a big genuine smile on his face and both arms open as if to give me a hug.  I'm excited.   \\nHere's how the movie made me feel:  As I get close to Rian with my arms reaching out for that promised hug\\, he sucker punches me right in the gut and then laughs at me!\\nHere's how I felt leaving the theater:\\nAs I'm doubled over in pain and shock\\, I look up at Rian with a questioning look and when I ask him \\\"Why?\\\"\\, he spits in my face and walks away laughing histerically!\\nI've been a Star Wars fan for 40 years.    \\nThe Last Jedi has completely ruined my enthusiasm towards anything new now for the Star Wars universe.
