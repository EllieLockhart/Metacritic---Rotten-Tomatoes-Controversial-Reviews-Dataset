Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Give me a buddy cop drama with Jar Jar and 15 yr old whiny Anakin\\, and I would like it more than this trash. I thought Attack of the Clones was bottom of the barrel for SW\\, but somehow Rian Johnson found a way to top that - namely by deconstructing everything fans enjoy about SW. \\\"Let the past die... kill it if you have to...\\\" Rian\\, you successfully killed the joy many fans have found in the franchise for decades... so congrats? 1\/2 star because Carrie Fisher was great. RIP.","true":true}
