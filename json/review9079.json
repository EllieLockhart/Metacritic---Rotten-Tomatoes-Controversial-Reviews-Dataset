Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of plot holes . Breaks rules established in 7 movies. that's not bold\\, that's lazy writing. The \\\"chase\\\" between the first order ships and the resistance had the same thrill as a race between a snail and a caterpilllar. nice visuals\\, but at this point it is not enough. I don't want the screenwriters to play safe\\, but c'mon guys...at least give your story a little logic.Forced humor in the critical moments\\, when people are dying. really? not even funny.","true":true}
