Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Feminist agenda movie - all the men are bumbling fools\\, cowards\\, and broken - no men heroes.  All the leaders are female - Kathleen Kennedy went on record with a \\\"The Force is Female\\\" shirt and statements during interviews gloating about how awesome Rian Johnson is with creating strong female leaders.\\n\\nI don't have a problem with strong women or anything like that - Princess Leia and Amadala were awesome - they were both strong.  \\n\\nAll the white men in the movie are branded as Nazis - all the men on the Rebels are incompetent.  Sorry - this movie series is historically full of fun fantasies for everyone to participate in.  Now\\, you can participate in it if  you're anything but a white male.  Enjoy your hijack of the series Kathleen and your SJW.\\n\\nI don't even consider this part of the star wars universe anymore.  The story ends at Ep. 6 and these are just cheap knock off B-roll star wars rips.  Download this stuff from Pirate Bay if you're curious - don't reward Disney for pushing their agenda.\\n\\nBTW - Disney has manipulated the Critic score here by hiring people to come on here and inflate the score.\\n\\nEnjoy! :)","true":true}
