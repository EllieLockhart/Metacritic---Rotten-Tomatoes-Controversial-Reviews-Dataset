Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much squandered potential and opportunity. Instead\\, we got an incoherent mashup of gratuitous CGI scenes stitched together with poorly developed character arcs\\, reams of throwaway dialogue\\, and gaping plot holes. I get that TLJ tried to be subversive\\, but it failed pretty spectacularly in execution. It only rates a full star out of respect for the franchise legacy\\, and it did keep me in my seat (grudgingly) till the end. ","true":true}
