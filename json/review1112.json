Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An utter disappointment and betrayal of Star Wars legacy. I don\u2019t mind a script being bold but this is outright taking a dump on everything that came before. I have little hope of this being rectified in the final film and with what happened in this film I have little reason to be interested in what happens next. ","true":true}
