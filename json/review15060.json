Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left The Force Awakens thinking \\\"hmm... that was pretty good. Not great\\, but good. Plenty of potential. It sets up lot's of interesting storylines and characters for the next movie. Rey's parents\\, Snoke\\, knights of Ren\\, Finn's injury\\, luke skywalker's map\\, blue lightsaber. I figured if the next movie does some interesting stuff with all this\\, gave some kind of payoff\\, it would raise my appreciation for The Force Awakens.\\n\\nNope. Everything gets figuratively\\, and literally\\, tossed aside and ignored. There is no payoff. None of it meant anything. This movie is a rejection of TFA.\\n\\nAnd what does it replace it with? Mucking about\\, mostly. Everyone acts like idiots and waste a bunch of time. Nobody changes. Nobody learns anything. Nobody achieves anything. \\n\\nYes\\, we see you shoehorning in Han Solo's dice. Something which never mattered before\\, but is clearly going to be a thing in the upcoming Solo movie. It was hamfisted and distracting. \\n\\nHopefully Abrams can get this franchise back on track for the next one.","true":true}
