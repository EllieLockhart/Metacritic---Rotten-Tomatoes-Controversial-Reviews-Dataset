Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not being a big fan of most of the Space Wizard franchise\\, I really like the newer movies (E7\\, Rogue One).\\n\\nNot only does this have a great production value and great directorial choices: the actors are perfect for their roles.\\n\\nThe writing is fairly good\\, the worst bits being the classic Space Wizards stuff where entire civilizations are being commanded because some super powered teen is cranky.\\n\\nSure it has some problems\\, but is overall very good and I not only look forward to the sequel\\, but watching it and the 7-9 trilogy again.","true":true}
