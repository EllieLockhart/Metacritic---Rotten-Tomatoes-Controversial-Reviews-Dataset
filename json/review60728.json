It was the strongest point of the first game\\, and it is the same with Part II. All the animations\\, sounds and dialog interwine perfectly\\, making you feel part of the game.\r\rNow\\, about the story (no spoilers). I get why people are angry. Many times one has high expectations\\, and when those expectation don't match with what we get\\, we get frustrated. But\\, to trash a game\\, a game studio\\, and to ask for the writers or other employes of Naughty Dog to resign? Boy\\, just\\, what the hell?\r\rThe story is complex\\, much more than in the first game. I don't see \\\"forced agenda\\\" or politics in the game\\, and this comes from someone who hates that kind of thing. I mean\\, we know Ellie is gay since the first game\\, and there are people still not cool with that? What were you expecting?\r\rThe game dificulty can be changed overall (easy\\, moderate\\, hard\\, etc)\\, or you can tweak it to your personal like: you can set the AI of your allies independently of the AI of the enemies\\, you can make the stealth mechanics more forgiving and the combat mechanics more challenging at the same time\\, and other things like that.\r\rWhy not giving it a 10? Because it's not a perfect game. Some animations\\, like walking backwards\\, sometimes feel odd. Also\\, the game makes it very clear when you are near enemies\\, and when there is no more danger. For people like me\\, who sucks at stealth games\\, this is awesome\\, but I know there are people who don't want any kind of help like this.\r\rTL;DR:\rIf you liked the first game\\, and you like complex stories with complex characters\\, you are going to enjoy this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
