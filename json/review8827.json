Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me The Last Jedi gave us a very unique aspect of the characters the original trilogy gave us to the characters introduced in The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi might be my 11th Favorite film this year and if I rank on my Star Wars movie list would be number 5. I HIGHLY recommend you seeing this film and do not care what the general audience thinks. I still need to see the film again myself to pick up what I missed. I will wait for week 2 to add to the box office :)!","true":true}
