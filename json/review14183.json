Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" I gave it three stars because it made me appreciate the prequels more; compared to this movie they now don't seem too bad. Is it just me or is the new trilogy completely ripping off the storyline of the original trilogy just with different characters? This one gives the illusion of creating drama when it really just a jumbled mess of characters making dumb decisions. ","true":true}
