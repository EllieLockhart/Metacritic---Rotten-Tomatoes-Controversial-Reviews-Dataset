Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to review this after seeing its predecessor TROS. If you are a fan of Luke Skywalker and the prequels (lightsaber battles and forms) there will be a few disappointments. With the sequel trilogy done\\, it feels that you need to watch the sequel trilogy as a whole. \\n\\nThe only thing that I would like to be in the story is the 3rd lesson and a few seconds  of screentime for Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. It will take a sort of acceptance to the storyflow or decisions of Luke Skywalker in this movie.","true":true}
