Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is such a mess\\, full of virtue signalling\\, story plot holes\\, story arks that in the end meant nothing to the final out come to the movie's plot. There's still no character development that make's you feel for any of them. The only feeling I had for this movie was my disgust of how they treated the story of Luke\\,it's like they never watched or understood the original trilogy. It was a struggle to sit though this mess at the cinema and actually I could not get half way through watching for the second time on blue ray. It is so sad Disney did not follow what Gorge Lucas had set out for the story but that's Disney for you they have to turn every thing into PG\\, SJW\\, FEMTARD nonsense.","true":true}
