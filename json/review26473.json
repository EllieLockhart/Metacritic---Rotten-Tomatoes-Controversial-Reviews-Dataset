Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Objectively average is what I keep saying about this film. No fault of any one person in but all that was set up in The Force Awakens fell short\\, was under utilised or just absent and some unresolved things just remain unresolved. That is my fan free attempt at being non bias\\, as a Star Wars fan my level if dissatisfaction keeps increasing for the reason of \\\"not my Luke\\\"\\, which relates to an interview given by Mark Hamill that I would suggest people read after you see the film if you find yourself feeling similar to the way I do.","true":true}
