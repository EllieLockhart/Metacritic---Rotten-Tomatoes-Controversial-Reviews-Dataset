Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that I was entertained the whole way through (apart from a number of cringe moments). Visually stunning\\, good acting. \\n\\nThat aside\\, the story telling\\, plot holes\\, and total disregard for the legacy of Star Wars and it's beloved characters make this one of the worst films I've ever seen.\\n\\n I can't believe how many missed opportunities there were with so many beloved aspects of Star Wars Lore. Characters killed off in the most anticlimactic meaningless ways\\, other characters demanding no respect from the audience as a result of a cheap laugh. \\n\\nI could spend hours unpacking the constant poorly thought through scenarios and resolutions to said scenarios that left me caring about and respecting the characters and story at an all time low. \\n\\nTo sum it up\\, Luke throwing his inherited lightsaber (a symbol of the Skywalker heritage and centre of the Star Wars legacy) over his shoulder is an exact depiction of what Ryan Johnson has done with the story. \\\"I don't really like that or care about it and I''m going over here to do what I want to do\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the Force Awakens Luke looks at that lightsaber with such intense emotion\\, pain and meaning and in the next moment tosses it away like a sweet wrapper - I don't buy it. Which is sadly how I felt about the slow mo race through space\\, Leia's Mary Poppins powers\\, the out of context casino nonsense and Rose and Finn's \\\"adventure\\\" that ultimately kills off the majority of the Resistance members\\, the children who are supposed to be the \\\"leaders\\\" of the dreaded First Order\\, Snoke's authority and ultimate fate\\, Luke's character and newly found force hologram powers\\, and the place we are left at the end of the film. That 12 rebels aboard the Millennium Falcon are any kind of \\\"resistance\\\" to an intergalactic regime who rule not only the world\\, but an entire galaxy\\, commanding billions of troops and fleets of the most advanced star destroyers. \\n\\nI have no expectation for Episode 9 because there is simply nothing to build on\\, or any questions that haven't already been anticlimactically answered. \\n\\nI don't blame people for enjoying the movie - I did to an extent. But to say it is a piece of brilliant\\, thought through film making\\, is simply delusional. How on earth Ryan John has been given a trilogy is baffling. I'm sure he's a good guy\\, but this is Star Wars\\, and it's worth so much more what I have just seen.","true":true}
