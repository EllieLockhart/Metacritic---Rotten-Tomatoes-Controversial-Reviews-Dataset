Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why should I care about the next movie?\\n\\nPoe? Ruined by The Last Jedi.\\nFinn? Ruined by The Last Jedi.\\nRey? Ruined by The Last Jedi.\\nThe Rebels? No resources\\, no ships. no allies.\\nRose? I'd rather have Jar-Jar.\\nHan? Dead.\\nLeia? Carrie Fisher passed away.\\nLuke? Dead and ruined by The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe only character I like now is Kylo Ren. Should I go into the next movie hoping he will kill the Rebels and rule the galaxy? No\\, we all know that won't happen. What a shit movie\\, it's full of plot holes\\, cringe humor\\, bad dialogue\\, and an awful contrived story. When Luke says \\\"the Jedi must end\\\" he means Star Wars.\\n\\nI feel terrible for both Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Mark Hamill's most iconic character was just ruined and Carrie Fisher's last appearance as Leia was ruined.\\n\\nIt gets a single star for being gorgeous as hell.","true":true}
