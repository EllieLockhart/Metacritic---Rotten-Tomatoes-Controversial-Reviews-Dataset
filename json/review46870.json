Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well were do I start with this mess of a movie. Well theres a few things I don't like. laura dern character is only in the movie to show how you should never question women in charge ever\\, even if they have some plan that could get people killed\\, she hides her plan for no good reason. Making Poe looking like a complete fool the whole movie.\\n\\nEven though in the last movie he wasn't shown to be a hot headed fool. Why did they change his character? Right cause he is a male. Just like how they made Luke Skywalker look like a complete fool in this movie also\\, why? Also cause he's a male. Now lets talk about Rey. Who is just the most powerful character for no reason. Just making her a Mary Sue. Why? It could because she a female.  With no backstory\\, and her character is kind of boring. Since she never really learns anything\\, or has to.  The only reason she is powerful is cause she's a female. This whole movie shoves so much SJW nonsense in your face\\, it forgets its a star wars movie. Instead it would rather be some political non sense.","true":true}
