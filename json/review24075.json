Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive disapointment. What was the point in this film? Killed off the two most promising characters without a backstory and the sub plots were terribly pointless. Didn't even feel like starwars with the economic political social capital bs. Made all the women out to be heroes and the men cowards. Made for the money and merchandise not the fans. The force awakens left us with plent questions and left us wanting more\\, this left us with no answers just more questions and wanting it removed from canon. Ruined the lore built by jj and george\\, and totally shit on lukes character and the Jedi. It's trying to get rid of everything that makes starwars starwars.","true":true}
