Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was visually appealing and all the acting was superb! The plot was too jarring and was going in so many directions that it did not need to focus on. Questions about main characters were not answered and now after watching the movie\\, I care even less about them. Disney is giving enough nostalgic moments to trick critics and fanboys into believing this was a great movie.  This movie did take great risks that the previous movie was afraid to do which was good. This felt like the last movie of the new trilogy rather than the second installment. Disney finessed the fans with this one because this had the potential to be the greatest star wars movie ever\\, but instead\\, they decided to give the fans a big F you instead and just ruined the movie on purpose by not developing characters and also not give us the answers to questions we waited two long years to see. This movie made me not want to see episode 9 because I'm no longer interested thanks to this movie!","true":true}
