Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adam Driver\\, as Kylo Ren\\, takes the stars on this Star Wars film. Don't get me wrong\\, there was great acting by others\\, such as Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker\\, but the only compelling piece of story was delivered to us by Driver. This film was tarnished by forced introductions of new characters\\, estranged deviations of old ones\\, and so much social justice mumbo jumbo that you could hardly enjoy the movie without thinking about the crap show going on outside the theater in our society today.","true":true}
