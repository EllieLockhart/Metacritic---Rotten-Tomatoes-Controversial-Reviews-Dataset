Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm an Asian. Disney may think I should like this movie better than the previous ones\\, but sad to say\\, this movie is a major LETDOWN. It does not deserve the name star wars. The original trilogy worked for a reason. It's about a HERO's story. But TLJ is more about Princess Rey and HOBO Luke with no character development that makes you emphatize. It gives nothing but a HOLLOW and shallow sense of entertainment","true":true}
