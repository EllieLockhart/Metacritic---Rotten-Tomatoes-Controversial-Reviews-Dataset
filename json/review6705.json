Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get the hate with this. Honestly. I get the plot holes and the dragged out sequences\\, but there's too much good shit in this for it to be a bad movie. Rey and Kylo Ren are incredible\\, arguably the two best characters in the whole saga. Big thumbs up","true":true}
