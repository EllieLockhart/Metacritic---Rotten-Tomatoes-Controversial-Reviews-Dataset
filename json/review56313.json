Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sub-par plot with too many storylines and Disney touches to be called a real Star Wars movie. Some of the action scenes are very well done with a lot of vivid pictures but they alone can\u2019t hold up an entire 2.5 hour movie. Didn\u2019t like Rose\u2019s character and her and Finns storyline was completely useless. There are a ton of other things I hate about this movie but you\u2019ll have to watch it to agree. Overall this is a redbox movie\\, not one I would spend theater money on. This is one of the worst Star Wars movies in the franchise.","true":true}
