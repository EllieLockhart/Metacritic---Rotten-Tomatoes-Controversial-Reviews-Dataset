Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"10 out 10. Daisy Ridely delivers an amazing performance again and Mark Hamill is just amazing in his return as Luke Skywalker. Even the new actors like Kelly Maria Tran as Rose Tico are fantastic. Rose has the best line of the film near the end. LOVE LOVE LOVE this film.","true":true}
