Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looks like Rian Johnson does not liked  Lucas and JJ Abrams  films the Last Jedi tried to destroy Force Awakens and the original Trilogies  and Luke\\, Episode IX  will be with almost not base or characters to work it\\, Casino and cows \\, pointless scenes \\,bad jokes\\, story holes\\, only saved by Kylo Ren  and Rey\\, this movie wasted Luke ending could be a lot better.","true":true}
