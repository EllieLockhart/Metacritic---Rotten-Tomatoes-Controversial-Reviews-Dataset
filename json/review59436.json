I was bored playing this by about half way and that\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d say about a Naughty Dog game. By the final third I just wanted it over with so I could sell it. The gameplay is very much the same as the original with not much innovation. I didn\u2019t mind that at first but after the 50th time sneaking around enemies it became robotic apart from a couple of exceptions. People praising this game for including lesbians\\, transgenders etc are missing the point. The story falls flat\\, they tried to be smart\\, daring and produce something shocking for the sake of being shocking but overall it\u2019s totally dull and such a depressing game to play. If I anything I thought it was too violent! Something I never thought I\u2019d say.I really loved the first game but I feel this one has tainted it\\, that\u2019s how poor the story is. The writer\u2019s egos got in the way unfortunately.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
