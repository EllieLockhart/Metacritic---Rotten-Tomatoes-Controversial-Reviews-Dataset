{"101487":163306,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-04","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably going to bounce all over the place in this review but some things need to be said.  [SPOILERS AHEAD!!]\\n\\n[MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!]\\n\\nI literally created an account just to talk about this movie\\, because as a life-long Star Wars fan\\, this movie was just downright insulting to me.\\n\\nFirst off\\, ratings don't even count on this site unless it's a least 1 star.  So for all the people trying to say it's the \\\"bots\\\" bringing the ratings down on this movie...no.  Just\\, no.  If all of the reviews were counted the way they should be\\, this movie would be so much lower than 48%.  So if anything\\, the rating for this movie is much higher than it should be\\, if you look at all the 1\/2 star reviews.\\n\\nNow\\, there's a lot of (liberal) political agenda going on in this movie.  Some of it is subtle\\, but most of it\\, they don't even TRY to hide.  Admiral Holdo...aka Admiral Gender Studies.  Not much needs to be said there\\, it mostly speaks for itself.  The moment I saw her\\, the FIRST thing I thought to myself was \\\"she looks like she just got back from the women's march\\\".  At the very least\\, she could've bothered to be in a military uniform\\, being an admiral and all.  I've never seen military personnel\\, especially high-ranking ones\\, in real life or in fiction\\, who weren't wearing their uniforms WHILE they were on military duty.  Not to mention all the capitalist hatred that Worse-Than-Jar-Jar Rose was spewing\\, that had literally NOTHING to do with the movie.  It's like the entire casino planet scene (worst part of the movie) served no purpose other than to push a political agenda.  And for all the hatred of the rich and the mistreating the poor\\, she decides she'd rather rescue a bunch of animals instead of saving the slave children.  And I'm biracial so don't even try to throw the race card in my direction\\, it won't work....but did anyone else notice how ALL of the good guys except Luke were either minorities\\, women\\, or aliens\\, while ALL of the bad guys were white men\\, except for Phasma\\, a white female who might as well be a man?  I highly doubt that was a coincidence.  And no\\, JJ\\, we're not \\\"threatened by women\\\" just because we dislike a movie that isn't good.  Most of us fans actually LOVED Rogue One.  Main character?  A WOMAN...an interesting one with real character development\\, who wasn't a mary sue\\, and who actually had a real place in the story.  Jyn Erso is one of my absolute favorite characters in the saga.  Don't try to blame the fans for you and Rian Johnson's failures.\\n\\nI'm not saying this is the worst movie in the franchise\\, but it comes close (this movie was one sand comment away from being as bad as Attack of the Clones)\\, but it certainly had BY FAR the worst plot in the entire franchise.  And I use the term \\\"plot\\\" loosely here.  Literally the biggest part of the plot in this movie was the Resistance running away from the First Order while they run our of fuel.  There are subplots like the casino planet (where's the Death Star when you need it) and Rey with her lack of training while trying to convince Luke to....be Luke.  And going into Rey's parents\\, a plotline that was MASSIVELY built up...just to be resolved in the most anti-climactic way ever.  Like\\, if Rey's parents were nobody\\, that'd be fine.  Don't spend a movie and half building up the anticipation just to slap every fan in the face.  All of the subplots were terrible\\, which is saying a lot when the main plot is the equivalent of a day-long intergalactic police chase.\\n\\nAnd then Snoke.  Another character who was built up in The Force Awakens....just to be killed by the most predictable Star Wars villain in the franchise in a way that makes Snoke look utterly pathetic.  And we still don't know who the f- he is\\, where he came from\\, and most importantly\\, why there's someone that powerful in the Force\\, but who was completely unknown since the Clone Wars\\, even though he's clearly old enough to have been around then.  What's the deal with him?  We'll never know\\, because he didn't do anything in the movie...and then he was dead.  For no reason.  He ultimately brought nothing to the story...but then\\, neither did this entire movie.\\n\\nI get that most saber fights in the movies have their flaws\\, but what the heck was with THIS fight??  One of the worst melee fights\\, if not THE worst\\, in the entire franchise.  Barely any better than the original Kenobi vs. Vader fight.  It was honestly cringeworthy and painful to watch.\\n\\nAnd then there's Rey...how much more of a mary sue could she be??  This movie takes place over the course of 2 days at the MOST\\, and it picks up right where TFA left off\\, where Rey had just discovered maybe a day earlier that she could use the Force.  So at the VERY VERY MOST\\, she's known that she can use the Force for about 4 days.  And in that time\\, she's had basically no training\\, and yet somehow\\, she can lift tons of rocks\\, probably a total of what weighed more than an X-Wing\\, something that LUKE SKYWALKER\\, who supposedly has the same amount of potential as THE CHOSEN ONE\\, wasn't able to do by the end of Empire Strikes Back after having\\, what\\, a few months of training? Pretty sure even Anakin wasn't able to pull that off until he'd had at least a few weeks\\, if not months\\, of training.\\n\\nAnd he certainly didn't fly through the vacuum of space like Leia.  What is it with all of these massively powerful\\, but almost completely untrained women who are pulling off feats that the most powerful men in galactic history would've had trouble with?  Hmmmmm.....bet that was a coincidence too\\, right?\\n\\nAnd what's with Luke's character being so completely destroyed?  He goes from seeing the good in Darth Vader\\, the man who was basically known as the face of all evil in the galaxy\\, to wanting to kill his teenage nephew because he sensed a \\\"growing darkness\\\" in him?  Are you for real right now??  And we all know Luke would never have just thrown his father's lightsaber over his shoulder nonchalantly like that.  For all the people trying to defend Luke in this movie\\, even Mark Hamill himself said this character wasn't Luke Skywalker\\, so there's no use in arguing about it.  Even Luke himself disagrees with Luke's character in this movie.\\n\\nRose IS worse than Jar Jar.  Don't try to justify her as a character\\, because it can't be done.  She contributes NOTHING to this movie.  In fact\\, she actually substantially takes away from the movie.  Her little anti-capitalist political messages are so forced\\, it feels like rape.  Not to mention she robbed Finn of what would've been his crowning moment and almost killed him in the process because she \\\"loves\\\" him even though she's spent 2 days MAX around him.  For all of her \\\"we win by saving what we love\\, not killing what we hate\\\"\\, that stunt she pulled would've literally destroyed the entire resistance if Luke's astral image hadn't shown up.  She is...undisputedly...unarguably...SOLIDLY and FACTUALLY\\, the WORST character in the entire franchise's history\\, including the EU.  Taking her out of the movie would've giving this movie a much higher rating.\\n\\nAnd how do you justify a Jedi master dying as a result of casting an image?  I understand this isn't the EU\\, but they could at least pretend like this takes place in the same galaxy as the EU.  In the EU\\, Luke was able to cast an image of an entire fleet coming out of hyperspace\\, and made the image so strong that it fooled a Sith Lord who was more powerful than Vader\\, and he was barely breathing hard as a result.  But here\\, he DIES by casting an image of one person.....pathetic way for Luke Skywalker\\, the HERO OF STAR WARS\\, to die!\\n\\nAnd how do they have Luke Skywalker being so convincingly overpowered by a teenage rookie who\\, even with years of training\\, almost lost to half a group of fighters who showed no evidence of being force sensitives?  And then imply that Luke would've lost the duel to Kylo Ren if he'd been there in person?  That would imply that the red guards could've handed Luke's butt to him.  Not to mention Luke getting overpowered by Rey\\, who was 3-4 days into her lack of training.  Based on this stuff\\, I'm pretty sure Padawan Kenobi could've taken every Force user in this movie by himself.  Except for maybe Snoke (maybe).\\n\\nThey completely turned General Hux\\, the ridiculously serious commander in TFA\\, into the butt of every joke and generally a laughing stock in this movie.  That little prank Poe pulled on Hux at the beginning was mildly funny for the first second or so\\, and then the joke ran for an obnoxiously long period of time.  There was no reason for it and it did nothing for the movie.  It belittled a GREAT character into nothing more than a gag.\\n\\nOh\\, and the casino planet in general was so horrible that it not only took away from the movie\\, it took away from the entire franchise as a whole.\\n\\nOf course this movie had (a few) good moments here and there\\, such as the hyperspace ram\\, which would've been much better if they'd had Admiral Ackbar make that sacrifice\\, rather than having Admiral Gender Studies\\, a complete unknown in the story\\, steal the big moment while Ackbar gets an offscreen death.  Imagine how much more emotional and inspired the audience would've been if Admiral Ackbar went out like that?  But instead\\, Admiral Feminazi makes the sacrifice and the entire audience is left thinking \\\"who cares?\\\".  Like\\, how stupid can the writers be?  That change alone might've brought the audience score at least into the 50s.  What a waste of potentially one of the greatest moments in the saga.  There were other little moments that were fairly okay\\, but not enough to make up for the disaster that this movie turned out to be.\\n\\nThis was visually the most stunning movie\\, but that's about where the pros end for the most part\\, other than the little moments here and there.  It had a few good funny moments too (like Rey \\\"reaching out\\\"...I died at that scene!)\\, but most of the humor was very force and misplaced.  They tried too hard to turn this movie into an action comedy like Guardians of the Galaxy or something.  \\n\\nThe score was the absolute most forgettable in the entire franchise\\, and Star Wars is supposed to be known for its excellent music.  \\n\\nOverall\\, this movie is the reason why I'm not longer excited for the upcoming Star Wars movies\\, and the SOLE reason why I will no longer be going out of my way to watch Star Wars movies on opening night anymore.  In fact\\, I probably won't watch any of the future movies in theaters at all unless someone invites me and pays for my ticket.  In fact\\, I probably still wouldn't go then\\, because I would be contributing funding into this nonsense\\, and after what happened with this movie\\, I feel like I can no longer spend money on this franchise\\, at least as it relates to the movies.  This movie was literally THAT bad.","true":true}
