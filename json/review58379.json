Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After I read what was going to happen at the end\\, and my friend bought tickets for us anyway\\, I was upset at first\\, but I came into the theater with lower expectations. I felt good after I left.\\n\\nBut after a week\\, I saw all these reviews covering my thoughts on what I initially thought about the movie before I saw it\\, and now retrospectively thinking of it\\, I really regret that Rian Johnson wrote and directed this movie.\\n\\nHe thinks his underlying framework of how he wrote Looper would work for The Last Jedi. It really didn't. It was disappointing\\, and I'm not going to watch 9\\, unless I read the synopsis\\, and it really does an above and beyond job.They lost a fan in me. \\n\\nTo me\\, the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi do not exist in my eyes. At all. I wouldn't let Rian Johnson near any huge brand ever again or any potentially great story\\, especially Sci Fi. \\n\\nThey need to get James Mangold\\, Lawrence Kasdan\\, and Christopher Nolan in one room. That's the only way this is going to work out. James Mangold proved himself with Logan\\, Christopher Nolan did so countless times\\, and Lawrence Kasdan is an original that made Star Wars what it is. \\n\\nAlso\\, it would solidify things if they got an award winning Sci Fi writer that's still alive right now. And put George Lucas back in it\\, but as a top creative consultant\\, since this is HIS baby. He put it on the map\\, and though not everything was perfect\\, he NEVER let it sunk this low. \\n\\nDisney just destroyed a brand it dropped over a Billion dollars on. Good job.","true":true}
