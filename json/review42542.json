Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a pretty good movie to begin with and I watched all of the star movies and this one would probably be my second favorite beginning with empire strikes back. There were a couple things i didn\u2019t like but overall it was a good movie.","true":true}
