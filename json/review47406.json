Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did I just watch? The Last Jedi just seems subversive for its own sake and offers no payoffs for any storylines. I have loved Star Wars for nearly 40 years and am utterly disinterested in episode 9 now. Apparently Disney is the real First Order. I'm certain you'll be able to see Mickey Mouse ears on all the storm troopers if you watch the IMAX version.","true":true}
