{"101487":151023,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of problems as a story and as science fiction---timelines and plot holes. Key characters running around on snipe hunts and thwarted at the last minute from heroism. Wrong people filling in at strange moments.  New rules in space combat without new explanations why these weren't used in the past\\, lots of strange decisions justified by unnecessarily hidden plot elements. Deus Ex Machina\\, we invoke you.\\n\\nA theme in The Last Jedi is to forget the past and move on.  Well\\, this movie pretty much has done that.  We're down to a Wookie and a character whose actress is now dead.  Much of the good of Star Wars original trilogy is gone\\, and it's not just the characters.\\n\\nSpecial effects good\\, though Snoke's chamber wasn't compelling and fights there were not especially inspiring. Outcome with Snoke's guards completely predictable.  Some interesting uses of force\\, but apparently the dark side makes you stupid and blind to the obvious.  Or maybe that's the testosterone that makes all the bad guys stupid at key junctures or something.  Hoth combat redux not very compelling.\\n\\nMovie was a mess. Parts were entertaining so mostly can be watched without boredom or too much aggravation---if you suspend all your judgement and love for first trilogy.","true":true}
