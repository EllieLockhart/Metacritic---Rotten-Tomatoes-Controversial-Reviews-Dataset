Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game is beautiful\\, artificial intelligence is very well done\\, the environment is dynamic and each match can be finished in many different ways.  In a gaming environment it is very good.  The story leaves you on the edge of the seat\\, but there is a moment in the story that represents almost 8 hours of gameplay that feels forced.  It had a merciful ending and\\, in my opinion\\, it is not as memorable as the first game\\, but it is still an unforgettable experience and\\, like all works\\, is always flawed.  What I didn't like was that they delved a lot into the antagonist's story and moved away from the main focus\\, which was Ellie's revenge.  Abby's character feels forced and Joel's death was predictable.  My score as a frequent player of naughty dog \u200b\u200bgames is 97. Some things were not for a post-apocalyptic world like that of the last of us.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
