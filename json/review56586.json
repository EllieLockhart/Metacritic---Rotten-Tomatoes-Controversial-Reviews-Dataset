Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a stirring homage and character progression of our original favorite Jedi\\, Luke Skywalker\\, with many surprises along the way for the old characters and the new!  It's a truly emotional  journey with stunning battle scenes as well!  As a fan since the 80s\\, I was enthralled and transported to my childhood while also enjoying the chance to see Luke and Leia's growth as characters.  Newcomer Kelly Marie Tran was a wonderful addition to the cast and Adam Driver's acting was phenomenal.  This easily rivals Empire Strikes Back for drama\\, thrills\\, and shocking developments!","true":true}
