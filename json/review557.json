I'm not big on horror movies \/ games\\, but I wanted something to play for Halloween and this fit the bill. I think its a solid rental choice but not worth 60 dollars.\r\rGame has incredible environments and fantastic character models. The character's faces are definitely uncanny valley stuff\\, but from a distance I'd swear they were footage of real people\\, just very well done.\r\rAt the beginning I felt like I was piecing together a mystery\\, and it my main drive to continue playing. That said\\, as the game progressed and the story came together I just wanted it to pick up the pace and end.\r\rI still don't understand why these teens go on vacation to a lodge during a harsh Canadian winter and never turn on the heat or one single light\\, except late in the game when they're told its a bad idea. They also wade through rivers up to their waists.\r\rThere are times when the story just made no sense to me\\, but I won't spoil anything. Characters make some insane choices that you have no control over. I mean\\, if you were told to stay put for one more hour till its daylight\\, would you choose to go out into the dark alone where people have died? I understand the game would be pretty boring if you just waited out the danger but at least give me a plausible motive for decisions like this\\, and the classic \\\"let's split up\\\" bit.\r\rThe game has a stats in the form of characteristics as well as a relationship status bar. These play\rno role in anything\\, so far as I can tell.\r\rI can't really provide much insight into just how important your choices are\\, other than determining who lives and who dies\\, as I have only done one play through. The game is roughly 10 hours long\\, and I don't feel like doing another play through - the Red-box is still picking rummaging through my wallet.\r\rOnce beaten\\, the game does allow you to start at various chapters to try and alter the story.\rI don't know how much the endings vary; only two people survived in my play through.\r\rI know I've mostly went on about the issues I've had with the game but its well worth a rental if you're in the mood for Quick Time Event\\, choose your own adventure horror.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
