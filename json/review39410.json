Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is slightly disappointing. Not horrible\\, but disappointing. The film is the oddball of the Skywalker Saga and while it incorporates new elements that you wouldn\u2019t regularly see in a Star Wars film\\, the execution of these differences is not the greatest.","true":true}
