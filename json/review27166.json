Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies I've watched for a long time. I really hoped this movie would give us reasonable answers to the setups of The Force Awakens. \\nThe Last Jedi does not give us answers nor deliver interesting story plots or even the most basic principles of character development and story writing. I decided for myself that I won't see the next star wars related movies and will rather watch guardians of the galaxy or the old lucas saga. Disney had the chance to impress us all but sadly decided to take the path of the least effort and maximum profit.","true":true}
