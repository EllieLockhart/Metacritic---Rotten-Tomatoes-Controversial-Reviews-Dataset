Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Problems everywhere with plotholes\\, did appreciate the effort\\, it felt really \\\"forced\\\"\\, get it.....fans will not embrace it because the heroes of our childhood really deserved a proper arc in their characters\\, I really feel no-one at the helm understood","true":true}
