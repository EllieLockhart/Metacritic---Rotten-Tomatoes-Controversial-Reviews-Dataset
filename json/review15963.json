Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to give this movie a .5 star. This move was that terrible. In fact\\, only does it rank above Attack of the Clones and that should tell you how much RJ destroyed the franchise with this movie\\, but the heroes from IV\\,V\\,VI. Kathleen Kennedy and her insertion of feminism\/female power & also political motives just reeks. These are no longer Star Wars movies. They are space propaganda to sell $$$.","true":true}
