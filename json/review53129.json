Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well-meaning but failed attempt to do something different with the license. Visually spectacular with quality performances\\, which are completely ruined by a long\\, boring chase sequence and a completely unbelievable back-story (the fringe terrorist radicals somehow take over the entire world over night?) which ironically retread the underdog rebel cliches of the classic trilogy. \\n\\nSPOILERS!\\n\\nThe film introduced some interesting characters like Holdo\\, DJ and particularly Rose\\, and then had them behave in bizarre and illogical ways (refusing to brief your top pilot on the plan? Falling in love with Finn in a day\\, and trying to \\\"save\\\" him by forcing him into a high-speed collision?). Maybe the latter was just a feeble back-peddle by Disney because they were too afraid to commit to Finn and Po being the only worthwhile romantic subplot. And killing the primary villain half-way through without bothering to explain anything about him was completely bizarre. Ultimately the film's worst failure was that it left the third film in what was always supposed to be a trilogy with absolutely nothing to work with\\, and it certainly showed. That and it was so dull that people I saw it with fell asleep half-way through\\, in spite of being lifelong Star Wars fans.\\n\\nBut seriously\\, if you're planning from the start to make a trilogy\\, maybe write the entire story out first and make the directors stick to it instead of making it up as they go along?","true":true}
