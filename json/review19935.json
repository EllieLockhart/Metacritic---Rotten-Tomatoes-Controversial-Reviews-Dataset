Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good\\, not great and certainly not better than ESB as some early critics said. As a film itself it is an action packed fun show but that's about it. It wanted to get deep but came up shallow. A bit over hyped and contrived but fun.","true":true}
