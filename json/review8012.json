Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fair enough\\, but by no means as good as the reviews I read suggested. I would rank it third in the series so far\\, with the first two places going to \\\"Star Wars\\\" and \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\". I find the huge gap between the average critic's score (93%) and audience score (56%) baffling. What's wrong with you guys? ;)","true":true}
