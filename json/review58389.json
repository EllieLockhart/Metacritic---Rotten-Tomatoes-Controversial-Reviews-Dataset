Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing some awful reviews and some that sounded more like trolling Disney for the hell of it\\, I was a little anxious about going to see it. However\\, I saw EVERY Star Wars movie since 1977 and was not about to miss this one! I am glad I saw it and can say that its a MUST SEE for every real Star Wars fan that ever existed! Those angry at the movie have nothing to be angry at in my opinion... As a Star Wars fan\\, I thought it was an awesome movie\\, which is ranking for me at number 3 behind Episode IV and VI in number 2 and 1 spots on my favourite Star Wars movies list!! \\n\\nTake my advice go and see it\\, leave the Disney haters to one side and make up your own mind on how good it was! For me\\, its a 5 star experience.  \\n\\nJust so you now\\, I rank Star Wars movies now in the following order for a) Enjoyability\\, b) Storyline Quality d) Plot Alignment to the Saga and e) Action V Emotional balance in scenes. My list of Star Wars movies along these lines are:\\n\\n1. Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\\n2. Episode IV - A New Hope\\n3. Episode VIII - The Last Jedi\\n4. Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\\n5. Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\\n6. Episode VII - The Force Awakens\\n7. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\\n8. Episode II - Attack of the Clones \\n9. Episode I - The Phantom Menace \\n\\nMay the 4th be with you all!","true":true}
