Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A REAL SHAME\\nThough funny at times\\, the movie feels the full 2.5 hours.  Some parts seem unnecessary\\, and add useless characters.  So many opportunities squandered.  The \\\"death\\\" of Luke was captured terribly.  Now I understand why reports surfaced stating  Mark Hamill hated what they did to the character\\, a real shame.","true":true}
