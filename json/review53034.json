Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone move\\, or as a continuation of The Force Awakens\\, this is a fine movie\\, though with some plot holes. For example\\, if Luke doesn't want to be found\\, why does he leave a map to his whereabouts?\\n\\nVisually\\, the movie is really good\\, the humour is in sync with recent fantasy\\, and some of the character arcs will interest some people\\, especially young people.  \\n\\nOn the other hand\\, if you're already a fan of Star Wars\\, this movie will likely hurt you. A young fan might not notice\\, but people with a few years under their belt will find Luke\\, especially\\, seriously out of character. In the past\\, his flaws were such things the naivety of hope\\, faith in his friends\\, trust that good will win. He had no tendencies to give up or a wish death to family members whose choices he disagrees with. \\n\\nFurther\\, according to this movie\\, nothing that happened in the original trilogy had any impact. Everything is the same\\, even though in the original series they defeated the empire (and presumably dismantled it) while revealing the hidden evil in their society. They even had Darth Vader's force ghost to tell them where are the Sith were hiding. Nothing changing is a highly unlikely outcome. \\n\\nIn a nutshell\\, this movie has detached itself from the originals\\, in tone and character\\, and is going its own way. If you don't care\\, then you will likely enjoy this movie. If you do care\\, and especially if you're old enough to know how things really work -- how people change and evolve in reality for example -- you will likely hate this movie.","true":true}
