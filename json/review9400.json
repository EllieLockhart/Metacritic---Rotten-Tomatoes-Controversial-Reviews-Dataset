Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving this film five stars due to the fact that the film was GREAT AND there are multiple people giving less than one star reviews.\\n\\nFirst thing to note about this movie\\, if you had a theory about what was going to happen\\, you were most likely wrong... accept that. There are many reviews complaining about the writing of this film\\, which is ill placed. Granted\\, there are a few plot hole points that are fair to point about\\, but to say this movie is terrible because you don't agree with the plot\/direction of the film is unbecoming.\\n\\nSomething to note about the Star Wars films is that they either mirror or copy the same structure of the previous movies. The Force Awakens copied the structure from Episode IV\\, and the prequels were meant to mirror (which means reverse) the original trilogy. The Last Jedi is no exception... it is LITERALLY The Empire Strikes back\\, just reversed. If you do not agree\\, think about the progression of the story.\\n\\nFor the reviews complaining about the First Order chasing\/following the Resistance in this movie and that being \\\"the entire story\\\"\\, think about The Empire Strikes Back and for how long we were watching the Falcon get chased.\\n\\nOverall\\, The Last Jedi is unpredictable\\, fun\\, and a wild ride which will question what you know about Star Wars. Disney and Rian Johnson have turned this Star Wars franchise into a new and exciting adventure that delivers a well shot film and story\\, AND sets you up for the next chapter in this epic space saga--and maybe even the new trilogy to come... \\n\\nMay the Force be with you\\, always...","true":true}
