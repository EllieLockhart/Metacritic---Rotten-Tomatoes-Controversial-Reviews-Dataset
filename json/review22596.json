{"101487":149832,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past [Star Wars] die. Kill it if you have to.\\\"\\n\\nThe \\\"Characters\\\"\\n\\nI wonder how much time Rian Johnson spent with JJ Abrams\\, did they have a meeting and he basically said\\, \\\"JJ\\, you know all those characters you set-up in the Force Awakens for a hero's journey three-part story arc\\, yeah I'm not interested in those for my film.\\\" \\n\\n\tSnoke is (apparently) killed off with no explanation as to his motives or backstory. And whilst boasting about how he can read Kylo's every thought\\, Kylo sneak attacks him with a lightsaber! Dumb\\, dumb\\, dumb!\\n\tPhasma isn't explored either and only appears at the end so she can get (possibly) killed off in an unnecessary fight scene. Although if it turns out she survived and appears in the next episode it will be the most clich\u00e9d 'back-from-the-dead' trope yet.\\n\tMaz is turned into a funny little \\\"rocket\\\" alien receiving calls whilst in the middle of a shootout (?!) barely in the film.\\n\tRose\\, Finn's new love interest\\, is written like a two-dimensional (at best) character from a bad American teen soap\/drama (eg. Dawson's Creek) who's ultimately very boring since the main cynical reason for her inclusion is for an Asian character to be introduced for the Chinese market. But the screenwriter(s) couldn't find any real purpose for a new character that actually served the story so she's only there to spell out all the plot exposition to Finn.\\n\tLeia suddenly becomes a full-on Jedi (who for some reason has never used her powers until it was time to save her own skin - not to fight the First Order\\, that would be ridiculous). And she flies in space like Superman\/Mary Poppins\\, only to be put into a coma for the rest of the movie because... erm... Holdo (?)\\n\tBB8 turns into the superhero of the film. He takes down some security guards with coins stashed inside him because a comical tiny muppety alien at a casino thought he was a slot machine (!)\\, and then saves the day by driving a Scout Walker to victory despite not having any hands. (And how the hell did he get up there in the first place?!!)\\n\tThere's no real point to Benicio Del Toro's character\\, he's only there to provide some plot convenience: By sheer coincidence he's conveniently in the same cell as Finn and Rose\\, he then conveniently rescues them in a hovering ship\\, and then he (conveniently for the screenwriters) betrays them only so the Resistance shuttles can be tracked so the final showdown can take place. (\\\"I'm going to go out of my way to help you on this suicide mission - oh wait\\, no I'm not\\, I'm going to betray you instead because the First Order will pay me more money and not torture the information out of me then kill me when they've got what they want\\, because actually they're not as bad as they seemed in the previous film and\\, besides\\, it serves the purpose of the C.O.D. philosophy I was telling you about the false perception of good and evil\\, right and wrong\\, that completely messes with the timeless\\, epic\\, mythological themes of Star Wars.  And I'm going to have this stutter because it's supposed to be funny\\, ...or\\, ...or\\, ...!?\\\")\\n\tBarbarella's purple-haired mother - I mean\\, Vice Admiral Holdo's character\\, looks like a throwback to Space 1999 and her subplot about being a cowardly commander or noble leader was so 'meh' I didn't care when she died. (Piloting an entire Mon Calamari starcruiser on her own as well. So what's the point of all the other technicians usually required? Why not just set it to 'autopilot' in that case and use one of the smaller ships that ran out of fuel earlier on? - Oh\\, because otherwise the plot wouldn't work. Yeah\\, there's a lot of those sort of excuses in this film.)\\n\tThen there was Yoda... Another pointless comic cameo that didn't fit the tone or lore of the universe which has been established over the last 40 years. He even used the Yiddish expression\\, \\\"Oy\\\". (So\\, is Yoda Jewish now?) In fact all of the non-human characters were only there for comic relief and\/or merchandising opportunities.\\n\\nFinn and Poe were not really explored\\, they were caricatures and their relationship as a collection of rebels together felt like another missed opportunity. In fact\\, all of the male characters were portrayed as schmucks (incompetent\\, evil\\, ignorant or idiots)\\, who had to learn a lesson from the 'Mary Sue' female characters: Poe by Holdo and Leia; Finn by Rose; Luke and Kylo by Rey.\\n\\nI thought the relationship between Rey and Kylo promised the only hint of any character interest in the entire film. But the characters JJ set up for a trilogy arc were completely trashed\\, and the new characters were poorly written and introduced\\, with little or no development.\\n\\nThe \\\"Story\\\"\\n\\nThe story was basically about trying to find a way of stopping the Rebels from being tracked through hyperspace. That's a good 50-minute Star Trek episode but it's a weak story for a whole Star Wars film. Tacked on to that were elements of The Empire Strikes Back\\, Spaceballs\\, Free Willy and Battlestar Galactica (Season 1\\, Episode 1: '33').\\n\\nFinn's whole side-quest about going to the casino planet to recruit a codebreaker was sooooo convoluted it just plain annoyed me and was a complete waste of time and investment\\, as it ultimately served no purpose in moving the plot forwards\\, and made the film overlong. Using the racing animals to escape was corny as hell - I saw it a mile off - and then to cut back to the stable boys for the epilogue - just! just! WHY!? (\\\"Cos we gotta give a positive message to the kiddies\\, that's why!\\\")\\n\\nThe things to me that worked on the story front were:\\n\tThe growing relationship between Kylo and Rey. The fight scene where they paired up was one of the few highlights (although the red backdrop made it look like a cheap Flash Gordon film set)\\n\tLuke and Rey's relationship\\, to a certain extent\\n\tSome of the plot twists\\n\\nI really wanted to like this film but I'm left with a feeling of disappointment. More so\\, I would say\\, than the prequels. That's not to say I think the prequels are better than The Last Jedi but at least they were consistent. I think my biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's inconsistent with the universe and the storyline. It's all well and good to shake things up\\, challenge the pre-conceptions of what Star Wars is or could be\\, but Rian Johnson seemed to do this just for the sake of it\\, throwing out the Expanded Universe\\, and made a bad film in the process. And as he won't be directing the next Star Wars episode I think this film is going to stick out like a sore thumb in a couple of years and JJ is going to really struggle with the tone of the next film. I worry this film is going to seem jarring and out of place. When the fuss has died down\\, people will look back and reassess this one as the black sheep of the family. (Perhaps it only got the good reviews it did out of kindness for Carrie Fisher.) I remember the prequels also got good reviews by the media on their release but have since been correctly reassessed in hindsight.\\n\\nI could define this feeling of 'lack of consistency' as just plain 'lack of logic' - nothing the characters did had any logic. For example\\, Rey was jumping about so much at the end from one location to the next\\, I gave up trying to rationalise how she got from A to B to C\\, etc. And there was absolutely no reason for Holdo to be soooo secretive to Poe\\, except as an excuse to create the pointless side-quest that was the weakest part of the film.\\n\\nThe \\\"Jokes\\\"\\n\\nYou could argue that The Last Jedi has the weakest opening scene of any of the Star Wars films. For the first 10-minutes I thought I was watching one of those co-branded Star-Wars commercials: General Hux is in an AT&T advert (like Yoda did for Vodaphone) for a better phone connection\\, the jokes on him though\\, ha-ha! Then Finn is falling all over the place slapstick style with fluid coming out of his suit. And at the end of The Force Awakens he seemed to be in a coma in real peril\\, but that was virtually ignored in this film.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens also had gags but they only occupied a small percentage of the movie\\, were generally quite amusing\\, well-placed\\, and didn't take away from the focus of the film. The Last Jedi takes it up into 40-50% territory and they aren't as well-timed or -placed. \\n\\nIt feels like Star Wars has turned into Marvels' Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. Whereas the tongue-in-cheek\\, irreverent\\, goofy humour in those films works\\, because there isn't a tone already there to ruin and the audience isn't as invested in them\\, it doesn't belong in the Star Wars universe. (Has nothing been learnt from Jar Jar Binks?)\\n\\nIt seemed to me that Rian Johnson only saw the point of any 'alien' characters as comic relief. But\\, like the prequels\\, they weren't funny - just annoying - especially the miniature muppets in the casino. I think he really wanted to make a Guardians of the Galaxy film\\, but Disney gave him Star Wars instead. It actually made me appreciate even more how well-balanced JJ got the tone in TFA. But I don't understand how JJ\\, as a producer on this one\\, let it slip through the net this time.\\n\\nI personally think that Rian Johnson should have been given a spin-off film instead\\, I think he could have done a better job with already established comedic sidekicks such as R2-D2 and C-3PO\\, he could have made that a funny little film with 60% jokes and a storyline that wouldn't have impacted the trilogy films. \\n\\nThe \\\"Moments\\\"\\n\\nThere were some good opportunities in the film to have some real moments\\, for me a lot of them were close but just missed: Luke turning up to fight Kylo Ren and inspire people to join the Rebellion. Nice plot twist - he's not really there. But did he then have to immediately die? What purpose does his death serve? He might as well have been there in person and sacrificed himself like Obi-Wan Kenobi did. And why isn't his relationship with Snoke explored? Maybe Snoke could have been involved with his death. It was \\\"okay\\\" but as a trick it's not the way I suspect Mark Hamill wanted to go out. And I do feel bad for Mark Hamill\\, I can see why he was so reticent about the direction of it and almost certainly wanted something better than what he got.\\n\\nAnd what was the business with the gold dice? A tie-in to the Han Solo film out next year? Just a corny and unnecessary distraction of a kitsch object that has no significance to this film and looks more like it is from 'Las Vegas' than 'a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away.'\\n\\nWithout getting too political and risk being accused of being a misogynistic fascist - I do wonder how much of an influence SJWs have in lobbying their agenda in Hollywood\\, as this film seemed to suffer from it.\\n\\nI really wanted to like The Last Jedi\\, but I can't. The fact I would have been glad if more of the characters had been killed off probably explains how I feel about it. I am going to have to file this trilogy along with the prequels and forget about it. At least I will still have the Despecialized and Revisited versions of the Original Trilogy\\, and Rogue One\\, to hold on to for comfort. \\n\\nI think I'm done with Star Wars. Timothy Zahn's excellent Thrawn Trilogy will remain my Episodes 7\\, 8 and 9. The best outcome would be if JJ Abrams re-edited and re-shot scenes for an alternative version of The Last Jedi whilst filming Episode 9.","true":true}
