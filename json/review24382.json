Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed feelings\\, though some is likely from having had very high expectations\\, and having sheltered myself from knowing anything about the plot before walking in. On the one hand\\, I loved the actions\\, characters\\, and theme. On the other\\, I hated how disjointed the two plot tracks were\\, and how they chose to end it.","true":true}
