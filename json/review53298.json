Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Considering the talent involved in making this film\\, from cast to crew\\, The Last Jedi is a underwhelming and disappointing experience that fails to capture the excitement and charisma that made the franchise so special in the first place.\\n\\nFrom dire pacing\\, questionabls performances and hokey dialogue\\, it's a film that seems desperate to pull on the emotional strings of those who rever characters old and new\\, leaving a hollow slog filled with humour that doesn't know when to stop and when to actually make you laugh.\\n\\nSome of the people behind this new set of films are self proclaimed fans\\, who are not shy in telling you how much they love Star Wars and it's wealth of characters and backstory. On this evidence\\, it's clear to see they love how much money it is going to make them\\, not the franchise itself.\\n\\nBeing different and willing to take risks should be applauded\\, when it's executed in a competent\\, enjoyable manner. The Last Jedi is certainly risky\\, it's certainly different for all the wrong reasons. Performances are more pantomime than endearing\\, all the more unbearable with the length of the film being unnecessary. There have been bad Star Wars films before but none have left me as disappointed and bewildered as The Last Jedi. \\n\\nP\\,S Has anyone seen Lando? Not even worthy of a mention it seems.","true":true}
