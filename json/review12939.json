Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd like to open this review with my biases: I like Star Wars. I especially like space battles. I do not like a lot of jokes in my Star Wars.\\n\\nThere will be some SPOILERS in this review. Sorry. \\n\\nThe opening of the movie was an excellent space battle\\, and featured some new evolutions of fan favorite starships. It was tense and emotional\\, and I was giddy.\\n\\nFrom there\\, the plot splits into three distinct plotlines: one that follows Rey's training by Luke\\, one that follows Poe and the Resistance fleet\\, and a third that follows Finn and Rose (a new character introduced in TLJ). Of the three\\, Finn and Rose had the least interesting storyline. It stretched on for too long and the tone didn't seem to fit the rest of the movie\\, or the franchise as a whole. And there was no real payoff. There were some nice action scenes here and there\\, but it generally wasn't worth the time they spent on it. Rey's training also dragged out early on. There were some truly odd moments. But it built to a truly amazing crescendo in the second act. Poe's storyline was consistently interesting and showed real character growth from him. There was one bizarre scene with Leia\\, but I am fairly sure it was a result of patching the already shot scenes together after Carrie's death and so I am willing to overlook it.\\n\\nThe three plotlines come back together on Krayt\\, the white planet with the crystal foxes shown in the trailers. From here on out\\, the movie is dialed up to eleven. This last hour and change of the movie papers over a lot of the earlier flaws. \\n\\nThe movie leaves a lot of specifics unaddressed. This bothers some people. It bothered me last night. It doesn't bother me today. There are enough hints to build off of\\, and exposition is what for books and comics are for. Empire was a great movie when all we knew about Boba Fett was that he was an awesome bounty hunter. RotJ ended with us not knowing much about the Emperor except that he corrupted Vader to the Dark Side and somehow conquered the galaxy. Learning the specifics ended up making them less interesting rather than more interesting. So I'm okay with filing in the blanks through other mediums (or not at all). I know enough.\\n\\nOverall\\, it was fun. There were parts I didn't care for. I'm not the target audience for those scenes. But I'm certain those exact same parts will be my son's favorites when I take him in  a few weeks (I wait for matinee crowds to die down before taking my noisy toddler to the theater). So it was flawed\\, but overall very good.\\n\\nNew Star Wars rankings:\\nV\\, IV\\, VI\\, RO\\, VIII\\, VII\\, III\\, II\\, I","true":true}
