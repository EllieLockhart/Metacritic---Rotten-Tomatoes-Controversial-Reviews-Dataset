Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So deeply disappointed right now. I dearly wanted to love this movie. I remember emerging from the theatre stunned\\, saddened. The reasons are well documented by many here. I never imagined signing up to Rotten Tomatoes but Such was my disappointment at this film\\, I felt compelled to have my little rant.","true":true}
