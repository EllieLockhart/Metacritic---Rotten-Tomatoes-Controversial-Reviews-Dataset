Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The highlight of this visually stunning\\, probably divisive but unconventional middle chapter is without any doubts the mesmerizing relationship between the hero and the villain. Rian Johnson takes what was great about the Luke\/Vader and Anakin\/Obi-Wan dynamics to new heights. As the Light and the Darkness inevitably attract each other\\, so do Rey and Kylo\\, whose strange connection moves in unpredictable directions and sets the tone of the entire movie.","true":true}
