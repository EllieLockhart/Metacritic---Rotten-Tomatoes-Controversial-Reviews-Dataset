With that finally coming I was finally able to complete the game with my thoughts and mixed feels of the game. With many people talking about many characters deaths going quick and how the should have gone a different  way is some what understandable. But also people playing the game and giving it negative feedback I think in too be more open minded about how they were killed. Joel being beat to death by a Abby with her wanting revenge for Joel killing her father in order to save Ellie.With Ellie seeing how Joel died made her wanting her revenge as well. With the way the story goes in my opinion is showing the Ellie is being coming more of a monster then Abby. Which is one of the reasons we play as both characters. With both Ellie and Abby coming together in the moment that cause everything to happen we see that Abby keeps herself from killing Dina being pregnant with Lev's help. With then next chapter coming too the farm house it shows the Ellie fells as if she has not gotten her true revenge by not killing Abby. With Tommy actions of pushing her to do so it triggers her ideas of what Abby did. With having her finally battle with Abby Ellie then realizes that Joel would not want her to turn into the kind of person that he was with always wanting revenge and succeeding at it. With her finally letting Abby go she is unevenly put at peace with her decision. Getting back to the farm house with Dina being gone\\, she understands that she made wrong decisions in her life accepting what she has done. Finding the guitar in the house that Joel made her  not being able to play it makes her leave the guitar know that she needs to let her haunted memories go and be at peace. With having an ending like that made me have dislikes about the game but is still one of the best games I've ever played.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
