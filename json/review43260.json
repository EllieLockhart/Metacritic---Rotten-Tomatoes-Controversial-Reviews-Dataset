Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a brilliant addition to the saga\\, at times you did not have clue which way it was going\\, which was fascinating and the first time since Empire Strikes Back that you could not predict the end. Having said that there where a few things that annoyed me\\, space ship bombers flying at 2 mph like WW2 bombers and although funny the first scene just went a bit to far. There where 2 more but don't want to put out a spoiler. The climax of the film makes up for it all though with a spectacular scene at the end. Enjoy! ","true":true}
