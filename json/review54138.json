Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the last Jedi\\, so far it's pretty much on par with force awakens\\, need a second viewing to really decide though where it lands in terms of ranking. The only thing I really didn't like was the forced inclusion of those annoying\\, pointless\\, money grabbing furball characters. They did nothing but annoy me and take me out of the film. \u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1 SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!! \ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\uded1\u26a0\ufe0f Also it was a bummer that the purple hair lady died\\, thought the character would have been good to keep around. Honestly thought Leia was going to take her place as the sacrifice to save the fleet. Either way it wasn't a real gripe for me. I thought there were way more awesome parts to the film than bad ones. Fin kicked butt\\, the major lightsaber fight scene\\, awesome... Luke's standoff\\, awesome... Leia\\, awesome... kylo taking over as emperor\\, pretty badass... very end scene reveal\\, you take that broom kid!","true":true}
