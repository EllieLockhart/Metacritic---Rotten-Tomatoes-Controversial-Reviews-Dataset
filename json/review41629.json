Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is horrible - It's taken this Social Justice \/ Feminism crsp to insane levels....the entire movie just women being heroic and women talking....\\n\\nThey've absolutely screwed the franchise worse than the the prequels....and Luke Skywalker OMFG\\, they've ruined him....","true":true}
