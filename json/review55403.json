Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made me miss the prequels...how is that possible? Everyone has their own opinions\\, I was bored most of the movie\\, not what I wanted. Didn't feel like a Star Wars movie at times. The movie did a disservice to the old characters while rushing story lines with the new. Very disappointed.  I agree\\, it is time for the Jedi to end based on this new trilogy. Force Awakens at least left mystery and intrigue\\, this new film was a let down.  Even the opening scene was rushed with the scrolling words explaining nothing\\, just there to be signature. Horrible movie\\, wish I had waited until Netflix to see it.","true":true}
