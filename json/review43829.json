Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will sadly be the last Star Wars movie I deliberately of my own free will give my cash to see. It was a mess of a film that seem to  urinate on the fans that had been waiting patiently to see nothing but disappointing conclusions and plot lines thrown away in favour of cheap gags.","true":true}
