Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the movie\\, I felt torn.  I loved everything except the part where Finn and the Asian girl had to go on their out of the blue side mission that resulted in failure. I realize they needed to introduce the children who will be the next generation of rebels \/ Jedi but it felt so out of left field for me. I was ready for Finn to make the ultimate sacrifice but what happened next just left me scratching my head. That kiss to Finn out of nowhere after the girl saved her just had me wondering if the writers\/director were just having fun at my expense.  Even my children told me as much after we got out of the movie theater.  I'm the nerdy fanboy and my children are the casual SW fans so the fact that we all agreed on the same points tell me there was a real disconnect with the writing here.  At the end of the day\\, we all agreed this was kind of \\\"meh\\\" compared to TFA which we all thoroughly enjoyed.","true":true}
