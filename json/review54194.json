{"101487":132313,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If The Last Jedi could be summed up into one word\\, it would be bold. Johnson's takes every preconceived notion an entering audience member might have and turns them all upside down. What really makes The Last Jedi shine are the incredible performances\\, the character interactions\\, and the sense of adventure. Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver really shine in this movie. Particularly\\, the scenes where Rey and Ren are shown communicating telepathically. These scenes provided an ample amount of drama to the film as each tried gaining an upper hand in redeeming or tempting the other to their respective side of the Force. Rey is eager to learn the ways of the Force and it makes everyone want to see her succeed. Kylo Ren is ridden with torment regarding his decisions and it makes the audience root for him to turn towards the light\\, which (spoiler) does not happen. Hamill played the role of a cynical\\, old hermit well\\, but still maintained his air of mysticism in crucial scenes throughout the movie. Poe Dameron is given more time to flesh out his character\\, while Finn and Rose adventure out across the galaxy to a beautiful casino world that is ridden with adventure. After the death of Skywalker in the film and the tragic passing of Carrie Fisher\\, the series is in wonderful hands with our new lead heroes in villains. Much of the controversy with this film is the fact that crucial characters die and plot points are either left unanswered or unexplored. Luke Skywalker\\, after projecting himself as a force ghost to face Kylo Ren\\, ascends to the netherworlds of the force. Supreme Leader Snoke is sliced in half like a roast beef sandwich. Rey's parents are revealed to be no one special at all. And you know what? All of these are okay. Luke has a mystical\\, respectable death. Snoke\\, much like the Emperor\\, was projected as an ugly hologram and was killed in the following movie. The backstory didn't come until the prequels. Who is Snoke? Snoke is Snoke. This death allows the focus to solely be on Kylo Ren as the main villain. Rey being from nowhere and no one essentially states that the Force resides in all of us. You don't have to be an elite few to be a strong Jedi. Star Wars: The Last Jedi may constantly tout that the Jedi will end and that they're extinct\\, but the film continues to follow through with themes established in A New Hope and reinforced in Empire Strikes Back. The Force surrounds the universe and binds it together. The Last Jedi reinforces key Star Wars lore and is a bold\\, fun ride.","true":true}
