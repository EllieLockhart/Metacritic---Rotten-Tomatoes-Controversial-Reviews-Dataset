{"101487":141515,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-13","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is astonishingly difficult for me to discuss how much I love THE LAST JEDI. I stumbled from the cinema\\, face utterly aching from all the ridiculous expressions I had pulled and mind a haze of images\\, but I was a different person.\\n\\nI say THE LAST JEDI is transformative because it transformed me.\\n\\nAnd that is very\\, very hard to quantify. My years and years of critical and analytical training fall by the wayside\\, not because I am incapable of seeing its flaws (this isn't \\\"turn off your brain\\\" entertainment)\\, but that whatever else one says about its negative qualtities\\, I could but numbly point to myself as testimony to its power: For the first time\\, I felt seen\\, truly seen by another in the medium of fiction. I felt reborn. The voices of doubt that have haunted me for so long are muted. I felt braver than I have in years and more able. I felt more at peace. I felt balanced.\\n\\nAnd I appreciate that all of that is very\\, very emphemeral if you aren't me and in my head.\\n\\nSo here is me trying to explain myself and why I suddenly have a convert's burning fervour.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTAR WARS AS A LANGUAGE\\n\\nI've always described STAR WARS as a language of icons and symbols that I spoke with near native fluency\\, and this is all still true. They are so very much part of our popular mythology[1]\\, especially in the quadrants of geekdom which I inhabit\\, that it is impossible not to have them mean things to me. Leia in her buns with a blaster\\, Yoda muttering wisely\\, Luke staring out under twin suns: all these images mean things to me. And of course\\, most of all\\, there is Carrie Fisher with her iconically sharp wit and her honesty when it comes to discussing her mental health problems over the years[2]. So for all that I didn't really care for (nor do I think I've seen all of) the original films\\, I spoke their language. I expressed myself in their paradigms and drew strength from the inspiration they provided[3].\\n\\nBut it wasn't wholly my mythology.\\n\\nUntil now.\\n\\nTHE LAST JEDI told me a story using that language I spoke\\, that I had learnt\\, that was almost mother tongue to me but not. It looked at me and told me that I was not a foreigner and embraced me as I am. It told me a story in that language but the difference was that this is a story that saw me and affirmed me.\\n\\nAnd there's a lot of power in that.\\n\\nA STORY ABOUT STORIES AND THE SPARK TO INSPIRE A REVOLUTION\\n\\nOn a basic level\\, the Sequel Trilogy has become a story about itself\\, turning inwards to reflect how it has inspired a generation of fans. Luke\\, Leia and Han have become inhuman icons\\, legends even\\, as Luke so bitterly puts it. And the new generation of characters have an intense relationship with that legacy and legend\\, be it Kylo Ren who is crushed by his own ambition and expectations\\, or Rey who aspires and dreams and claims. Those are the stories they grew up on\\, the stories that give succor their souls.\\n\\nTHE LAST JEDI looks to those legends and seeks to make them human. Leia is frail\\, complex and a leader worn to bone\\, for all that she holds it desperately together[4]. And Luke\\, he does not wear the mantle of Legend lightly. He has failed his own nephew and is hiding from the world\\, waiting to die. The beacon of hope is heavy thing to carry alone\\, but as THE LAST JEDI shows\\, it is not a thing that need be carried alone.\\n\\nThe last shot of the film is of an abused slaveboy of Canto Bight\\, pulling a broom into his hands with the Force and looking to the stars. For all that he and his friends are oppressed\\, that spark of revolution has ignited and they're telling the story of Luke Skywalker\\, the man who has become again myth. His story inspires as the Resistance is reborn. It is impossible to not see in those children our own young selves and future generations of children\\, and to be inspired to fight as they will.\\n\\nIt is not easy\\, being a Legend\\, to preserve and inspire\\, but it is also necessary. In dark times much like that came before and will continue in the months ahead\\, it is stories like these that will keep us in hope. Do we not tell stories like these to each other\\, of each small victory.\\n\\nThe way to defeat the First Order with only a laser sword in hand is not through violence itself\\, but through inspiration[5]. To keep that fiery spit of hope alive.\\n\\nWar is but the metaphor through which the story of the Resistance is told. It is not so much really about X-wings and star destroyers. The stakes are magnified\\, but the need for hope\\, for inspiration is the same. The fight against exploitative governance\\, against fascist rule\\, against opportunistic centrism\\, that all rings painfully true. It is the perfect\\, desperate story to close 2017 with.\\n\\nAnd there is power in that.\\n\\nA RESISTANCE OF WOMEN\\n\\nFor the first time\\, I saw a resistance movement brimming with women. And unlike\\, say\\, the Amazons of Wonder Woman\\, there was no contrivanced in universe reason for this beyond this *was* a resistance. This speaks a bone-deep truth that we very rarely see depicted\\, that women have always\\, always fought\\, that women are still today the backbone of the Resistance.\\n\\nIt was beautiful beyond words to see three women speak one after the other on military matters[6]. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that; any other film would have \\\"spaced them out\\\" with male voices.\\n\\nThat women occupied both important and marginal roles in the Resistance meant the world to me. They hold up more than half the sky.\\n\\nTallie\\, Paige Tico\\, Vice Admiral Holdo\\, Lieutenant Connix\\, Commander D'Acy: the litany of their names can bring tears to my eyes.\\n\\nI didn't know I had been waiting all my life to see this. I didn't know I needed it so much.\\n\\nFurthermore\\, whilst there are a lot of stories of sisterhood and motherhood in the realms of women's fiction\\, there are far fewer that deal simply with curt professional respect between women. And more than that\\, this isn't a film about female resistance (like\\, say\\, SUFFRAGETTE) this is simply a film about resistance that acknowledges women's impact.\\n\\nAnd there is power in that.\\n\\nBURNING THE OLD ORDER\\n\\nTearing down old\\, poisonous systems emerges as a core theme in THE LAST JEDI: Luke burns down the sacred tree of the Jedi religion\\, Rose talks of wanting to put her fist through the glittering world of Canto Bight\\, and of course Kylo Ren wants desperately to kill the past.\\n\\nTHE LAST JEDI holds both the Jedi and the Empire accountable for past sins\\, but doesn't fall into the trap of suggesting that they are both equally bad. It has Luke look back and see his own failings\\, as well as Poe being taken to task for his \\\"flyboy\\\" bravado. But despite this ability to make human its heroes\\, it condemns half hearted centrism and the smug moral superiority of not choosing a side in the figure of DJ\\, the replacement Master Codebreaker. He makes the argument to Finn that there is no such thing as good guys and bad guys\\, and tries to pull him down into that grey sludge of a paradigm with him. This is the argument all too often mistaken for complexity and nuance\\, the idea that both extremes are somehow equivalent: they are not[7].\\n\\nI have Rey's nostalgia for the old world\\, her desire to carry on the torch and preserve ancient texts. I know that feeling all too well and I know I needed to hear that some things\\, however much it may hurt to do so\\, need to die. I know it even in my own writing where for years I've stalled at endings because I was unwilling to kill off a character or to topple the systems I've so carefully constructed.\\n\\nAnd for all that there may be overly destructive ways to tear down the past\\, sometimes it does just need to die. THE LAST JEDI gave me courage to confront this both in fiction and in myself.\\n\\nCanto Bight and its worldbuilding of the larger conflict in the galaxy shine an important light on the broken systems that exist around them\\, how the nature of the war itself needs to change. I am all too familiar with Rose's desire to just break it all and the fathier herd's gloriously destructive romp through the glittering ugliness of the place is immensely cathartic.\\n\\nBut Rose doesn't lose sight of what matters: to save those you love. It is the sentiment she utters to Finn as she unsaddles the fathier that carried her all this way. She echoes it again in what may be the heart of the film to him again after saving his life. We need to do more than just destroy our enemies. We need to do more than hate.\\n\\nIt is a very simple sentiment\\, cloying even\\, but in a year like 2017\\, where rage and despair have become second nature to me\\, I had desperately needed to hear this. It reminded me what should ground me.\\n\\nAnd there is power in that.\\n\\nA PARABLE ABOUT FAILURE\\n\\nYoda utters one of the central statements of the film\\, that failure is the best teacher. And THE LAST JEDI is a film about failure. Perhaps it is just because it is the middle film of trilogy\\, but everyone fails in it\\, gloriously and ingloriously; victories are pyrrhic at best. All three times I watched it I was left emotionally drained\\, but it is also immensely cathartic.\\n\\nCanto Bight forms the heart of this meditation on failure. The subplot has struck many as \\\"pointless\\\" because it ends in catastrophic failure\\, but is hugely important to me because it ends in failure. We are perhaps too used to the idea that narrative needs to like clockwork in how rigorously engineered it is\\, without loose ends. It is the same thinking that makes executive producers want to cut the No Man's Land sequence in WONDER WOMAN  because it doesn't contribute to the larger plot of murdering Ares. Yet much like Canto Bight\\, that sequence forms the emotional and thematic core of the film when it comes to how the conflict between First Order and Resistance fits into the larger world\\, how those who not fight can be complicit\\, how the Resistance can and should inspire.\\n\\nBut more than that\\, Canto Bight is a subplot where the million-to-one chance doesn't pay off. Where the mad heroic last stand ends catastrophically. Not all long shots work out.\\n\\nAnd the failure isn't softened by glory\\, by heroic beauty. This isn't the tragedy of Bambi's mother or the Iron Giant. This is raw and ugly. This is unexpected and difficult.\\n\\nBut at the same time\\, failures aren't simply things to be expunged from your past. Not all that ends in failure is itself a mistake. The world isn't a logic puzzle one can simply optimise and plot a perfect speedrun of. Which I know all sounds rather pompous\\, but it is also a critical lesson.\\n\\nAnd there is power in that.\\n\\nTHE REFOCUSING OF STAR WARS\\n\\nRian Johnson's work has long deconstructed toxic masculinity and a recurring theme is the destructive potential of scared little boys. LOOPER\\, in particular\\, comes to mind\\, as does BRICK. And these are themes that recur in popular culture as well. From FIGHT CLUB to GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY vol.II\\, from BREAKING BAD to BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\\, we are constantly talking about men and masculinity.\\n\\nBut THE LAST JEDI does something different than many if not most of these films: it refocuses on the characters who aren't the tortured men. Film Critic Hulk writes very eloquently about this in THE FORCE BELONGS TO US (which has incidentally led me to the conclusion that the correct response to \\\"May the Force be with you\\\" is \\\"The Force belongs to us all\\\".)\\n\\nTHE LAST JEDI doesn't simply show the failings caused by toxic masculinity  but it also shows with hope how we can heal. Especially in Kylo Ren\\, the film shows the dark path and unflinchingly shows the consequences of his choices\\, his inability to\\, well\\, as this article put it\\, \\\"join the team\\\". There is a lot more to be said here that Sam says better than me\\, so I urge you to among all the other links\\, read his take on Kylo Ren: \\\"THE LAST JEDI\\, TOXIC MASCULINITY AND SHOWING YOUR PLACE IN ALL THIS.\\\"\\n\\nAnd if it were just Rey and Leia and Holdo\\, the picture of female heroism in THE LAST JEDI would be problematically white\\, but there is also Rose.\\n\\nThere are few things about Rose I can say that haven't already been said. She truly is the hero we have been waiting for. And she is just perfect.\\n\\nAnd I know many are disappointed about her kiss with Finn\\, partly because they ship Stormpilot (and tbf\\, so do I) and partly because many felt it lacked \\\"chemistry\\\".\\n\\nBut it is the first interracial kiss I can name on the big screen that doesn't involve a white person. I know that sounds weirdly specific but it feeds into that refocusing of the narrative away from the assumed defaults of our popular culture. It felt momentous in a way I cannot describe.\\n\\nAnd this all\\, there is power in this all.\\n\\nREY AS AN IMPOSTER\\n\\nI've left this point last\\, not because it is the least important to me but because it is the hardest to articulate and rather the most personal to me. And where above I feel like I'm echoing points that you will see elsewhere on the web\\, this is likely unique to me.\\n\\nSo please permit me a rather personal preamble: All my life\\, I've been laying claim to a literature and legacy that is not my own by blood and birth. I'm ethnically Chinese and I spent the early years of my life in the colony of Hong Kong. I went to boarding school and for better or for worse\\, I spent my childhood dreaming of King Arthur and Robin Hood\\, of the Bronte's Yorkshire moors and the Lake District of Arthur Ransome.\\n\\nAnd I wrote a novel bound up in that legacy of Northern England and British literature. It came out in 2017 and all year those feelings of being an interloper and imposter have been welling up. I had a lot of bravado in my youth\\, I would declare that I belonged\\, but now but a debut novel\\, I feel all the more vulnerable than before and my claim feels weaker than ever. The question that had been asked again and again of me in my youth: \\\"Why do you care about this?\\\" comes back to haunt me.\\n\\nAnd this is what I see in Rey's story. On some metaphorical level\\, her arc felt utterly about me. Like how the refrain of a good pop song can seem to perfectly fit you and your mood\\, but moreso. A thousand times moreso. I felt seen and understood.\\n\\nRey has that same bravado I recognise in myself\\, the assumption that she belongs. She feels it in her bones and she dreams of it at night. She claims the legacy of the Jedi as her own\\, asking Luke to teach her of the ways of the Force.\\n\\nBut beneath the island is the dark side and the dark side is a mirror. She has operated under the assumption that she must belong\\, that she has claim the details of which she simply doesn't know yet. That there is a grand secret to her origins (one admittedly that I don't have)\\, one that will vindicate her. But all she needs and all she has is herself.\\n\\nThe fandom speculation in the years building up to this makes all these themes all the more acute. That feeling that these are stories that one must inherit\\, that this legacy cannot simply be claimed by those outside of it.\\n\\nBut this much THE LAST JEDI makes clear: Rey's blood and her birth don't matter. She belongs\\, she belongs\\, she belongs.\\n\\nAnd that\\, to me\\, is everything.","true":true}
