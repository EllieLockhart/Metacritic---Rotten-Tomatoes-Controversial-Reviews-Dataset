Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lol.. I love the 1\/2 star reviews on this site.  Read them... wah wah wah .. they didn't take the story where I wanted.. wah wah.. the bad guy wasn't bad enough.. \\n\\nlisten if you want to see IV V VI go buy them and watch them. If you want to see a new star wars movie that's really very good and I felt truly unpredictable. Then go watch this.\\n\\nThis movie makes the rebels seem desperate. And there is internal and external conflict because of that desperation.  There are no plot holes. And the acting is some of the best seen in any star wars film.\\n\\nFan boys won't like the treatment of Luke if they read comics and other lore but if you enjoyed the other star wars films.. and that's more or less your star wars universe with the odd game tossed in there. Then you'll like this one.\\n\\nI guess fans might also be upset about reys origins and her training. But when they watch the first movie and this one again they might understand that they created stupid hypothesis about her that should never have existed to begin with.\\n\\nIf there is one weird thing about the movie it's when this movie occurs. It actually starts right after the last. All the other films had time gaps between them that let the fan base create there own lore.  They can't do that this time.  Hehehehe\\n\\nGood movie.. can't wait to see the next one.","true":true}
