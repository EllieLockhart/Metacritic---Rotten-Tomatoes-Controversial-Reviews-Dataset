Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move was Amazing. Sure\\, they introduce some new concepts that may turn off older fans\\, but they did an amazing job of telling a story we had never seen before in a Star Wars movie. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo is great. Finn and Rose\\, not so much. And yes\\, Luke and Rey could have had more screen time when they were on the island\\, but this is definitely one of the best performances we have seen from Mark Hamill as Luke. Yes he was a bit under used\\, but he made the movie great. As a fan\\, I too was taken aback by some of the new things introduced in the movie. But the more I think about it\\, they were for the better. The best part about this is that now we will not know what episode 9 is going to be like. They have so much potential with what they can do there.","true":true}
