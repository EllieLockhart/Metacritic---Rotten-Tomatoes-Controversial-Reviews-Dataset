Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an attempt to bring GOT style \\\"subverting expectations\\\" into the star wars franchise\\, while trying to embed world views on socio-economic issues. None of these things add value to the movie\\, and it automatically will ruin the next one.","true":true}
