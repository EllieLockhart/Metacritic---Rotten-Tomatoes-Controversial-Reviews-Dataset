Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A tragic waste of much-loved characters. The butchering of Luke Skywalker's character arc was heartbreaking. Despite my deep love for Star Wars from childhood\\, I for one am out... This movie destroys the established lore and wipes the slate for Disney to create new stories\\, but they are stories which I won't be watching. \\n\\nI-III\\, Rogue One & IV-XI and the limits of my internal Star Wars cannon.","true":true}
