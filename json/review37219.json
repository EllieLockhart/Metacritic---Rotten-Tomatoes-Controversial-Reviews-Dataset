Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original Star Wars movies were made for adults but kids loved the movies as well. The new Star Wars movies are made for kids and adults are an afterthought.\\n\\nSadly\\, this movie doesn't have any of the clever nostalgia or well thought-out storylines like Rogue One. It's like Disney had a checkbox of sequences they had to hit for this film and really didn't care if it made sense. In fact on many occasions the movie is just downright ridiculous. Unfortunately it looks like Star Wars has made a full pivot away from the old films and toward the world of Disney with Porgs\\, dim-witted politically correct characters\\, and oversimplified and unimaginative story lines.","true":true}
