Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Casuals and new fans will like it. Star Wars fans will hate it. You can see proof of that on here.
