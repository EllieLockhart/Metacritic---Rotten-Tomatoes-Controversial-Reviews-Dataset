Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- Large portions of the movie felt like they were wasting my time. Some characters are focused on too much and some aren't given nearly enough screen time as they deserve.\\n- The logic expressed by characters and factions was terrible\\, why cant the first order see small space craft...why couldn't the purple hair lady share her escape plan?\\n- The dialogue\/forced jokes were extremely hard to witness and I felt myself cringing or laughing in disbelief at some of the stuff that was in this movie.\\n- Absolute lack of action. I dont watch Star Wars to wade through a movie filled with mainly poorly scripted and acted drama\\, I come to see lightsabers clash and large scale ground\/space battles. There are some decent space battles\\, a good-looking but unfulfilling ground battle and while lightsabers are used - two lightsabers never clash in this movie...\\n- Disregard for many things established or set up in previous movies\\, The Last Jedi basically just shits on anything set up in The Force Awakens and also does what it wants with events\/powers\/characters it wants.
