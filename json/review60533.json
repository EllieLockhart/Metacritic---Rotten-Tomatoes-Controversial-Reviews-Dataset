This is honestly one of the most disappointing games probably ever.

This is honestly one of the most disappointing games probably ever. It tries to do something bold and different with the story but in my opinion it\u2019s just done very poorly and could have been done much better. What they were trying to do with the story is interesting but it just doesn\u2019t work. It was actually kind of hard to get through this game because the story is just not enjoyable for the most part. But it seems to me maybe that\u2019s what naughty dog was trying to accomplish idk? Other than that everything else about this game is top tier. I mean the graphics on this game are absolutely gorgeous. I mean maybe the best of this generation. The combat was amazing I mean you actually feel what\u2019s going on in game it can get super intense\\, and it\u2019s top tier combat. The music like the first game is just exceptional. Playing on a harder difficulty gives you a real challenge and also that realistic feel which I love.  I\u2019d recommend waiting to buy this game until it goes on sell because i think it\u2019s going to be very hard to replay this game if you aren\u2019t the biggest fan of the story. The combat and actual gameplay can only carry this game so much. Having a great story is crucial to a game like this. So I can\u2019t justify a $60 purchase. I was torn between giving this game a 6 or 7 and I ultimately choose 7 because it does have some very satisfying gameplay and some serious intense gaming moments.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
