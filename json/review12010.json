Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. In many ways it was so different from the other Star Wars films\\, but in the best possible way. For me it was the best Star Wars movie to date - I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I cared about what happened to the people on screen. I love good character development and I feel that was one of The Last Jedi's strongest points along with the connection between Rey and Ben Solo. I'm very impressed that Rian Johnson had the guts to take the franchise in the direction he did and I can't wait to see how J.J. Abrams will build upon what Rian has made here.","true":true}
