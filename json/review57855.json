Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We enjoyed it!  A little more character development would make you care about some of the newer people more\\, but then it would have been 4 hours long LOL.  This was classic Star Wars.  RIP Carrie Fisher\\, that moment when Luke kissed her on the forehead choked me up (having nothing to do with the movie.)  It's a shame the 3 original leads are all \\\"out of the picture\\\" (pun intended) although I guess we could get some Luke flashbacks here and there or appearances a la Yoda\/Ben.  It makes me more annoyed with Lucas that he didn't do these episodes instead of the prequels so the same actors would be available.  The prequels could have been done anytime with any actors.","true":true}
