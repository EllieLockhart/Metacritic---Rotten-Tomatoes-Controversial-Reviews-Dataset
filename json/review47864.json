Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start with this movie...the biggest and most obvious being the SJW identity politics that ruined any potential character\/plot development that could have occurred. Honestly I liked Force Awakens and Rogue One but this trash fire of a movie is just as ridiculous and persevere as the SJW ideology itself. The characters that started the reboot (albeit generic) that could have been we will never know what they could have been nor the depth that made them people they are will never be known because of a handful of  people's political agendas. The plot of the movie really doesn't matter because nothing really happens despite the fact that the movie is the longest in the franchise's history.","true":true}
