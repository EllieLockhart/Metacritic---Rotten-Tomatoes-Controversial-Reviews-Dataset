Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm huge SW fan but i'm pulling a plug after this one. I will not go to the theater to watch no. 9. This is not a bad SW movie it's a bed movie.
