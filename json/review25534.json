Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(NO SPOILERS) Temper your expectations. His movie is NOT what the critics are saying it is. Yes\\, it is beautiful and there are some incredible visuals\\, but that\u2019s about where it ends. The plot\\, the pacing\\, the forced humor attempts\\, etc. This movie left me feeling incredibly disappointed. The Star Wars galaxy used to feel massive. Those days are long gone.","true":true}
