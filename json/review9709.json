Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Sci-fi movie\\, HORRIBLE Star Wars movie.  Its as if Rian Johnson wanted to make something different so much that it results in a bad movie.  Plot holes galore\\, flying space Leia\\, no backstory on Snoke or Rey\\, pointless Finn and Rose story arc\\, pointless DJ arc\\, Luke Skywalker udder milk and fake fish and fake fight. Luke is going to murder a student in their sleep because he senses some darkside in him?  Not in Luke' character.  Btw\\, burn the Force books and force tree?  And why?  Just because. This movie was crap.","true":true}
