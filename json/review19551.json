Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's weird - there's \\\"star wars\\\" in the name\\, the characters share the same names\\, yet there is no alignment\\, continuity\\, nor even any resemblance and not only with the original trilogy or the prequels but even if the last movies as well :)\\n\\nThe actors are okay but the narrative is probably the weakest of any movies I have ever seen and it's not because of the choices made but because of how there are no alignment or connection with preexisting universe\\, how a lot of things are made completely inconsequential and many other flaws that are honestly simply flaws of storytelling. \\n\\nI don't think it would pass as acceptable in a creative writing course in university\\, so it's both shocking and interesting that one of the least professional pieces of narrative met one of the most iconic franchises. Or perhaps creators just didn't really care about the narrative\\, were more into CGI\\, explosions and talking plush toys :)","true":true}
