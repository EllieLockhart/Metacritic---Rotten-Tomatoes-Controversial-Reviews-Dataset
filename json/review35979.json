Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi not only falls short of the massive hype built up in fandom\\, but also falters from major plot deficiencies\\, disorienting moments that break the suspension of disbelief\\, a near-total disregard for the questions and expectations raised by The Force Awakens\\, and the importing of a foreign visual style into the Star Wars franchise. Cool action sequences\\, emotional reunions\\, and a powerful 3rd (4th?) Act cannot make up for these glaring missteps.","true":true}
