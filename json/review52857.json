Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing how Rian missed entire essence of Star Wars. Abrams pushed this trilogy downhill\\, but now it hit rock bottom. As Mark Hammil said\\, this is not my Luke Skywalker. Maybe to the younger audience movie will be great but i believe that every fan who watched SW from beginnings will agree that this is just poor attempt of remake with little attempt to write plot and scenario worthy of SW name. If some people wrote better stories in books of old expanded universe\\, why professional moviemakers and script writers cannot write anything but cheap remake and then continue that with this so called SW movie. For me\\, sadly\\, as long as Disney makes SW it is dead to me.","true":true}
