Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cringe-worthy dialogue\\, sloppy scripting\\, and lazy filmmaking ruin what otherwise might have been a fine addition to the Star Wars franchise. Every single scene is interrupted by a bad joke or a miserable line-the movie never lets a serious moment linger for more than a beat.\\n\\nI cannot overstate how ham-fisted much of the dialogue is. On multiple occasions\\, a line (or lines!) repeat exactly what has just been said by another character\\, or shown in the previous scene. As an audience member\\, I wanted to scream at the screen\\, \\\"I KNOW! YOU JUST SHOWED ME! WHY ARE YOU NOW TELLING ME AGAIN?\\\"\\n\\nEvery character and extra seems immune to the pain of loss\\, even as their friends and comrades die in droves around them. The character Rose Tico is one of the few who seem capable of feeling this loss\\, even temporarily\\, and her character benefits greatly from it. Unfortunately\\, her character is caught up in a ridiculous \\\"side mission\\\" that sucks the energy from the film\\, deflating the excellent work done at the outset with her character.\\n\\nThough the script does not do the cast justice\\, they admirably soldiered through\\, delivering stellar performances all around. Both young and old delivered the repetitive and witless dialogue with passion and grace\\, but in the end even the wonderful performances of of Ridley\\, Hamill\\, and others could not salvage the film.\\n\\nAs expected\\, the visual and sound effects are stellar\\, as well as the score. But in the end\\, I just couldn't enjoy this movie when every scene was punctuated with a stupid joke\\, gag\\, or bit.\\n\\nThe original Star Wars films made us laugh\\, true\\, but they also made us sad\\, nervous\\, sometimes even terrified. The only emotion I felt for The Last Jedi was a profound remorse for what the film could have been.","true":true}
