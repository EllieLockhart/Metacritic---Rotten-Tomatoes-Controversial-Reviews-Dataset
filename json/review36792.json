Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie started off pretty good. The visual affects are nothing less than stellar.However\\, the story itself leaped off a cliff quickly.  The bottom line... I watched it once\\, I was able to get through it easily enough (not like the prequels where I had to stop watching for fear of losing IQ)\\, but I will most likely never watch it again... sad to say.","true":true}
