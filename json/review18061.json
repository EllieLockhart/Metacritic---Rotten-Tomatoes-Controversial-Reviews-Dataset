Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this will become my favourite Star Wars over time. It has more heart than most of the other films put together. Funny\\, exciting\\, moving...the first time that Mark Hamill has made the character more than two dimensional. Plaudits to Rian Johnson for making a SW film like no other. What's not to like?\\n\\nNovember 2019...I just watched it again to prep for the new one and my review stands! In fact\\, it's even better than I remembered. Probably best one after Ep IV","true":true}
