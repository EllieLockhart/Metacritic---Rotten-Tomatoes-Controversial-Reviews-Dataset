Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an excellent action to the Star Wars saga. Rain Johnson took several chances in this movie. Some work\\, some do not. The good far out ways the bad. There are several cheer out loud moments that will make both new fans and the old school diehards smile. Overall\\, another job well done for Lucasfilm under the Disney umbrella. ","true":true}
