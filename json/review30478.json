Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shills out in force\\, it seems.\\n\\nListen - if all you want is a visually fantastic sci-fi action\/comedy romp (with some pretty odd moments of sobriety)\\, this may be the movie for you. And I truly mean that. Decent summer flick wearing star wars skin.\\n\\nIf you are looking for competent storytelling\\, look elsewhere. Plot holes abound\\, and the heavy handed moralizing the film does is at best condescending\\, at worst\\, nonsensical (eg \\\"We win fighting to save what we love\\\"). The comedy is used to cut dramatic tension quite inappropriately at times. Interesting plot threads that may have lead to some much needed character development are wasted. Other plot threads forgotten if not subverted\\, seemingly\\, for the sake of subversion. \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\,\\\" indeed\\, is a bit TOO on the nose a foreshadowing statement\\, expect to have every plot arc end with a twist\\, whether or not the logic follows.\\n\\nThe greatest sin for this movie\\, I think\\, is the completely dramatically ineffective characters. Played competently\\, yes\\, but weak writing has dealt the unfortunate souls playing the film roles a weak hand. Heroes first - Rey? Mary sue\\, cardboard cutout. Finn? Pointless\\, wasted potential. Luke? Face-turn-heel-turn-face. Poe? Emasculated\\, castigated. Rose? Literally who\/what\/why? Holdo? Incompetent commander\\, mega \\\"stereotypical feminist\\\" type. Villians - Hux? Bumbling\\, ineffective\\, comedic foil. Phasma? Wasted. Snoke? Unimportant\\, dead. Kylo? Whiny\\, impotent\\, occasional foil.\\n\\nNone of these characters are GOOD at getting me to do what they need me to do - care. With incompetence being the name of the game (save for Rey - space messiah she is)\\, ineffectual heroes\\, villains that would fail to properly intimidate a toddler\\, the \\\"big bad\\\" dead... There is literally not an iota of conflict left worth exploring. By the end\\, I couldn't give a toss what happened to ANY of the characters. My hope for salvaging the potential from the first movie\\, dashed.\\n\\nIt subverted so many expectations\\, and yet\\, where subversion of expectations may have been interesting\\, Rian clings fast to safety\\, for some reason refusing to push that particular envelope. Rey is as always dedicated to the path of the light\\, beacon of unfailing righteousness that will unerringly make correct decision after decision\\, completely foregoing all chances at the failure a characteristically empathetic character makes.\\n\\nHadn't intended to review this movie\\, honestly\\, but the influx of people giving brazen passes because this movie suits their politics is absurd\\, if they aren't purely corporate shills looking to secure a better reputation for their pet project. The Mouse needs to get his house in order.","true":true}
