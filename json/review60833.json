We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part II is a truly fantastic game being given 1\/10s by two kinds of people: people who are who attached to what they *wanted* the game to be and people who haven't played the game at all. This is \\\"Part II\\\" and not a sequel in the truest sense - it's a continuation of all of the themes and plot points and ideas that came out of the end of the first game. Yes\\, Joel dying made perfect sense after what he did. It was always likely and it was absolutely given its due weight.\r\r-Ellie sets off on the warpath\\, but as you proceed through her section of the game\\, you find out more about her increasingly complicated relationship and eventual falling out with Joel after she found out what happened in Salt Lake City\\, adding a complicated layer to her motives for going after Abby. What's she really after? What's going on in her head?\r\r-You spend the first half of the game hating Abby... until you get to her part of the game\\, learn about her background\\, and spend three days with her that are written as a parallel to Joel's arc in the first game. 90% of the people who are complaining about her fall into the latter group mentioned at the top - people who haven't played the game at all.\r\r-I'm tempted to give the game a 9\/10 because I don't quite think it sticks the landing. The reasons for Ellie apparently forgiving and moving on from Joel (and not killing Abby) are kind of muddled - it's presented as though the flashbacks to her time with Joel make her change her mind\\, but it's not really clear why she remembers the particular moments she does at the moments she does. Why go all the way to Santa Barbara only *then* to decide to forgive Joel while her hands are around Abby's neck? It almost works\\, but I don't think it quite does.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
