Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has added a new and indescribable element to the Star Wars franchise. From different visual techniques that Star Wars has never seen to plot points that will question everything that you know\\, TLJ is everything that cinema was created for. It blew my mind\\, it gave me the chills\\, and dammit it made me cry. In the beginning\\, I\\, a cinema-nerd\\, questioned the visual and technical correlation to the previous films\\, but be not afraid Rian Johnson prevails in one of the most visually-stunning and chilling finales that film has ever seen. Rejoice Star Wars geeks\\, the future is in good hands.","true":true}
