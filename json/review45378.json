Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Vapid\\, generic\\, damning\\, DISNEY literally killed Star Wars by driving that final nail in its coffin. Luke is just a kooky island hobo nihilist that milks alien tits on screen. All that wait for this. And that Leia superman thing\\, Rose SJW subplot...... list is endless and keeps increasing more i think about this.\\nI hated the prequels. George Lucas wasn't in his best element\\, but at least they felt Star Warsy and still had that magical element in his movies. This was STAR WARS for the snowflake millennials. Pathetic. Fuck you DISNEY. Ok\\, its done. Well\\, time to move on with life.","true":true}
