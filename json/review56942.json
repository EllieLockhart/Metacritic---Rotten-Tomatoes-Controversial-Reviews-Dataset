Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The truth is that The Last Jedi is a really fun\\, great looking sci-fi\/fantasy adventure\\, but it is a lousy Star Wars movie. I think that the pushback against the social agendas within this film is very upsetting because #1 who cares about what the characters look like as long as they're well written\\, and #2 it overshadows the conversation about this movie's actual problems (relative to the franchise). Disney and Rian Johnson seem to have wanted to \\\"surprise\\\" people so bad that they decided it was okay to throw out the rules of the franchise to do so. For the purpose of cohesive story telling\\, when one is world bulding\\, it helps to have some well-considered constants; things like how the force works\\, how force-wielder's lineage comes into play\\, what it means to be a Jedi\/Sith\\, how space based technology and lightspeed travel work\\, and what it would mean for the past\/present\/future of the franchise if those rules were to be altered or \\\"cast aside\\\" are things that all need to be weighed heavily against the story that one is trying to tell. These are things that have already been established\\, but Mr. Johnson did not appear ro consider any of them as he ran slapdash through the thoughtfully constructed SW universe and changed what he pleased to make his installment more subversive and unexpected. Well congrats\\, Rian\\, you made a movie so different and unexpected that it isn't really even a Star Wars movie anymore. So yeah\\, great blockbuster\\, bad SW movie.","true":true}
