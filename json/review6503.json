Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissapointed at first watch. Amazing and ecxellent on second viewing. Absolutely loved the movie for its originality. it doesn't change the characters too much\\, but still let the audience see them develop into the people they'll become and have become. Bravo Rian Johnson for bringing something new to the table!","true":true}
