Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a wonderful movie. There is good and bad in it yes (as in many movies)\\, but I feel the overall product was an acceptional addition to the Skywalker Saga. I am very happy with the Direction Rian Johnson took\\, and I can't wait to see how the next installment adds to this saga.","true":true}
