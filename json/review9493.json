Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good basic movie overall. Nothing special. But all in all it was a horrible star wars movie that targeted a lot of casual fans. Very little substance to it\\, character development was awful. Plot seemed to lose itself in a lot of places that made it seem like they added a lot of filler scenes just for kicks. Killed off waaaaayyyyy too many characters. This isn't game of thrones guys. You can't introduce characters\\, hype them up and then kill them off before doing anything with them. What a waste of potential. And don't get me started on Luke. Talk about the biggest let down. Completely ruined who he used to be. \\n\\nLike I said\\, great for a casual fan who doesn't look too much into it. But overall just a bad bad star wars movie.","true":true}
