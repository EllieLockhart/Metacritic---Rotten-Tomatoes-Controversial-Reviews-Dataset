Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many\\, I felt the need to create an account to show my dissatisfaction with this film. Rian Johnson had me very excited for this film based off of his precious work but this was a big letdown. I won't go into all the flaws of this film in detail but I will list all the things that this movie got wrong.\\n\\n-Horrible plot \\n-Humor that does not belong in a Star Wars film \\n-SJW agenda \\n-Characters with no emotional connection to us\\, the audience \\n-The treatment of iconic Luke Skywalker \\n\\nI can go on and on but these are my main problems with this film. At the end of the day\\, it didn't feel as if I was watching a Star Wars movie which was the most disappointing feeling of all.","true":true}
