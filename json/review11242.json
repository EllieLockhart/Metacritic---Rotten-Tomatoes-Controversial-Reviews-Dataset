Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly? Meh. Some parts were cool\\, others were just WHY. They were trying way too hard to appease to kids with their many\\, many gimmicks. The slapstick jokes just aren\u2019t Star Wars. They work for marvel\\, but Star Wars is Beyond that \u2014 or they used to be. The franchise has always been something to look up to\\, the intricate storyline and badassery always having a seemingly flawless finesse. Now it\u2019s been overshadowed as a joke. Totally disappointing.","true":true}
