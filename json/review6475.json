Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disregard the efforts of weirdos and bots to pointlessly review bomb this movie. The last Jedi is the star wars movie that both diehard fans and new adapters deserve. Rian Johnson was able to write a love letter to the original series while also driving the story in amazing and unexpected new directions. Absolutely worth the watch I'd only to see Mark Hammil in a perfect performance.","true":true}
