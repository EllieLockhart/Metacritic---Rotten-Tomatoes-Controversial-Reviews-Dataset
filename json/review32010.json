Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

It wasn't bad\\, but the whole thing felt VERY preechy.\\nThe whole Mary Poppins thing was an absolute joke. Like it ruined the whole movie for me personally. The whole casino planet segment was unnecessary and achieved nothing. Snoke being built up that much\\, apparently insanely powerful only for that to happen?..\\nThere were some good parts with the main characters\\, but all the ancillary characters feel hollow and unnecessary; there's no depth to them.\\nStill very much preferred the force awakens! Felt rushed\\, preechy and P.C.","true":true}
