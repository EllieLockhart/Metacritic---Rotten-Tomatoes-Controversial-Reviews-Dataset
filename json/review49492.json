Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WOW!!! All Rian Johnson had to do was not \\\"F**K IT UP\\\" when he took the wheel from JJ.  I saw this last week after it had been out a week and was warned it was awful....  My first clue is the Hollywood\/leftist overtone of the move putting anyone and everyone in key roles except any white dudes....  Way to go Disney..... Please don't trash this franchise like you have ESPN.....  Is this a joke?  Did JJ lose a bet?  At least humor the fans by making this some dream Luke had a bout his future and not an actual movie that has not basic plot\\, sub plots stolen from 2001 a space odyssey with the awful space stand-off scenes....My take is that the critics flat out don't get it and realistically don't pay\/finance endeavors like this... THE F'NING FANS DO!!!! That is who goes to see it and ultimately make or break the movie\\, not a self righteous critic who has no clue about the history\\, expectations\\, etc.  The biggest clue that this movie was a catastrophic failure is the critics ratings being so high\\, while the fans are so low..... This film is not some indie\\, CAAN \\, BS that will make 1MIL and be a success somewhere.  This movie is supposed to follow some story line that aligns with the whole saga\\, not KILL off LUKE and make him weaker that Obi-Wan in Episode IV.  Please Rian Johnson do the entire galaxy a favor and run away from this franchise before you kill it for good.....","true":true}
