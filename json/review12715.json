Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could write an 100 page paper on everything i hate and that is wrong with this. This is terrible in everyway\\, I dont about ep 9. Star wars is over for me and many others. I would have gave it a 1\/2 star but i heard rt doesnt count them.","true":true}
