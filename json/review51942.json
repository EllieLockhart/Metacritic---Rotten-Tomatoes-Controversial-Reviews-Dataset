Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A flawed yet entertaining Star Wars film\\, The Last Jedi is the best film in the sequel trilogy! This film is a great reminder of what Star Wars films used to be: Out of the ordinary with an original fresh plot\\, while giving a fun introduction to some new interesting characters. In fact\\, that is this films biggest flaw\\, while being so different that at times it doesn't feel like a Star Wars film at all. Which in it of itself is a great thing that The Force Awakens struggled with. For example\\, that whole canto bight sequence was a really fun scene but felt more like something that would appear in a Marvel movie than a Star Wars movie. But other than that this film does everything The Force Awakens got wrong\\, right. With an original unique plot\\, great visuals\\, character development\\, and the perfect amount of Star Wars references\\, this is a great film with an entertaining plot and is a perfect popcorn movie and in my opinion a fresh 8\/10 film!","true":true}
