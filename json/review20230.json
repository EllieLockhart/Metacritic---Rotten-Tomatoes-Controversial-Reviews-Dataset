Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was painful to watch. Though visually stunning\\, there was nothing else that could be considered a redeeming trait. The story is confusing\\, the star wars universe's own rules are rewritten and it's not even entertaining.\\n\\nTerrible.","true":true}
