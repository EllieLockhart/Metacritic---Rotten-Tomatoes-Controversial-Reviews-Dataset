Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie at a Thursday late night showing.  It is just awful\\, it is a lot of lame jokes\\, a dull subplot\\, a dumb premise\\, and a horrible Mary Poppins impersonation.  \\n\\nI have no idea how so many critics are giving this movie an unbelievably high rating of 91% from critics. \\n\\nIt's a badly put together movie with hollow characters and no common sense.  I cringed more at bad jokes in this movie than any other in recent memory. \\n\\nPlease\\, only see a matinee and treat it like a kids movie (despite the violence).","true":true}
