Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie has some flaws\\, it is clearly more ambitious than any Star Wars to date and I think the risk pays off. It takes the characters\\, the lore and the audience expectations and throws them around in an unexpected but ultimately fulfilling way. You can clearly see Rian Jhonson's ideas and creativity in it and the fact it's so ambitious makes it more vulnerable to initial criticism\\, whereas TFA was endearing but ultimately safe. I think when the dust has settled\\, this is going to be remembered as the third-best star wars movie after Empire and A New Hope.","true":true}
