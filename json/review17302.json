Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie but no amount of desire on my part could make this film any good.  There were powerful moments\\, to be sure\\, as well as some stunning visuals and a great score.  But these things stood apart from an otherwise overwrought and ill conceived movie where there was more to roll your eyes and groan at than actual enjoy.  Between magical spacewalks\\, ripped off tropes\\, storylines that didn't advance the plot at all\\, characters whose arcs went nowhere and a general sense of hubris\\, the movie is one of the biggest disappointments in the franchise (and yes I include the prequels in my algebra).   I never thought I'd dislike a Star Wars movie so much and am saddened that I do.","true":true}
