Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is one of the best star wars ever made. It completely revives the otherwise doomed trilogy with twist after twist\\, but leaves some plot holes which i assume will be answered in the next film. You will probably cry if you are a star wars fan after watching this.","true":true}
