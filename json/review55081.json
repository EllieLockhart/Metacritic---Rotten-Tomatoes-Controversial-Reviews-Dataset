Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked into the theatre expecting all of my questions from episode 7 to be answered\\, and left sorely disappointed.  Plot holes were completely thrown out\\, and new ones were created.  The writing was horrible\\, and Disney's humor just doesn't feel right inside of a Star Wars movie.  This movie would be summed up as an hour and 30 minutes car chase through space\\, an unnecessary romance used for filler\\, and concluded by what was hands down the biggest letdown of the entire movie.  Fans of the franchise will be disappointed\\, and folks new to the franchise will probably think it's fine.  Either way\\, after watching it\\, it's pretty obvious how episode 9 will play out.  I expected more from Disney.","true":true}
