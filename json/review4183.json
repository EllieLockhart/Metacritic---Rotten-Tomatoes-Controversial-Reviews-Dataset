{"101487":111608,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By attempting to not be the movie everyone expected\\, The Last Jedi fails to be the movie it should have been. It\u2019s enjoyable enough in places\\, but too many plot twists inside of plot twists sprinkled with a hefty dose of MacGuffin left me scratching my head at the end. Episode IX should be titled The Last Hope...unless it corrects much of the flaws in Last Jedi and delivers the film we all deserve\\, then this third trilogy will ultimately disappoint almost as much as the second trilogy.
