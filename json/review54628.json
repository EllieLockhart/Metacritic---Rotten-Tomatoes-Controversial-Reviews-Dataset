Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Inconsistent jumpy plot\\, absurd magical tricks performed left and right by any bystander. The main protagonist Rey is hollow and boring\\, lacking motivation and drives except \\\"hurr-durr\\, destroy siths\\\". Even friendship between Poe\\, Finn and Rey looks forced and untrue. The only interesting thing is Kylo -- Luke story\\, but it's thrown away like many other potentially intriguing beginnings from the Force Awakens. The new movie tries to lift off from Skywalker saga but fails to introduce anything except confusion.","true":true}
