Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a great Addison to the Star Wars sag. It actually felt like new\\, fresh Star Wars movie unlike the force awakens. Through out the movie\\, there are many consequences that puts episode 9 in A very interesting path that I can\u00e2(TM)t wait to witness. Rey is not as overpowered as the force awakens but is still a Mary Sue but I don\u00e2(TM)t mind it because daisy Ridley is extremely likable as Rey that I\u00e2(TM)m fine that she is a Mary Sue. Oscar Isaac portrays Poe as a true hero and is my favorite character in the film. Finn and Rose are 2 goofy characters and seem like they belong in the marvel cinematic universe. Finally\\, Kylo Ren is still a very whiny villain and Adam driver is not given an opportunity to shine as actor\\, which is a shame because he is a very good actor\\nThe last Jedi is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe and I\u00e2(TM)m very excited to see how it ends in episode 9 \\n8.5\/10","true":true}
