{"101487":136257,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-07","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a fan. I have every figure 3 3\/4 and 6 inch for this film. I will still buy every one released. I have every Star Wars movie and watch them over and over again\\, except this one. The writing in this film is atrocious. Everything is convenience\\, divisive and not thought out properly. You cannot go 1 minute without seeing errors or plot contrivance. Characters are wasted for agendas including Phasma\\, Hux\\, Finn\\, Luke\\, Poe and Snoke just to name a few. What were the filmmakers thinking. Like I said I spent hundreds on stuff for this film just as every star wars film. I am such a loyal fan that I will buy a 6\\\" Holdo fig when it hits the stores. Still\\, did it have to be this bad. This film subverting nothing but my wallet and it calls me names through social media for not liking it. My advice to Disney. Take your film franchise seriously instead of sending focus groups to deal with spin control. Avoid this film if you can. I've only seen it twice compared to seeing Solo 5 times\\, Rogue one over 30 times\\, Force Awakens over 30 times and the rest of the films over 100 times. My sheer viewing numbers should tell you what I think of Star Wars today and how Last Jedi corresponds.","true":true}
