Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The wrtting was terrible. Luke's story was very week. He came off as a weak and creepy old man hovering over Ray at certain points. They spent half the movie chasing a \\\" code breaker\\\"  that was a gigantic waste of time and a distraction from the important characters and their development.  I'm OK with the new direction for the series but at least close things in a coherent way for the narratives that have been present throughout the series.","true":true}
