Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been Star Wars fan since I was 5 years old and this movie is a beautiful disgrace\\, is very well done but the plot rips all the Star Wars filosophy\\, I never think that I ever hate a Star Wars movie and I like even the precuels\\, even with the miniclorians shit\\, but this one I really hate it and I think I'll never gonna see a Star Wars movie that came from Disney.","true":true}
