Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a sad day for Star Wars fans! Today\\, our own Superman was destroyed and given a terrible script. What a way to deconstruct the greatest Jedi character. And if you include that 45 minute subplot with Finn\\, Rose and Benicio that achieved nothing plus the throne room scene repeating elements from Episode VI\\, or Leia \u00e0 la Starlord or Maz Kanata with her jetpack plus Laura Dern's useless subplot. What a missed opportunity!","true":true}
