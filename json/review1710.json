Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a production...awe inspiring in cinematics. As entertainment...story line not as smooth and as coherent as past movies. Some glaring plot holes and continuity issues. If one has the ability to suspend judgement it can be a great viewing experience.","true":true}
