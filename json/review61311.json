Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Average story and average or even bad new characters introduced in this game\\, I think i kind of understand the ND attempt of trying to make us like new characters but it is poorly done.

Also didn't really like the ending choice\\, the Abby character introduction is just a pain in the ass\\, all Abby chapters were like side quests\\, but we're playing TLOU2 for great pacing\\, great story not for having hard time finishing boring chapters like Abbys are. This game definitely left me frustrated\\, and gave me some emotions but not like the first game and clearly not like I expected. I respect the risks taken but Naughty Dog\\, you really missed the target.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
