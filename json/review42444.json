Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. It treats the characters and lore with utter disrespect\\, destroys Luke's character\\, and relies on pretty visuals in an attempt to distract you from the horrible story and it's unending list of glaring plot holes.","true":true}
