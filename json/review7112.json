Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Endless list of problems. Script was written based off of the comments made by trolls for the first film. They took Return of the Jedi\\, Empire\\, The Hunger Games\\, Guardians of the Galaxy\\, and The Matrix and threw them into a blender to create an insanely long and insultingly dumb movie. The rules of the Force are as follows: \\\"It does whatever is convenient to a particular scene.\\\" The Force has become the Deus Ex Machina of the galaxy.","true":true}
