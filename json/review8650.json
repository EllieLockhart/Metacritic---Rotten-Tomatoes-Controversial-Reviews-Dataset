Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time leaving a Star Wars film that I've been disappointed\\, Rian Johnson got this SO wrong after a great start to this trilogy under JJ Abrams.. Disney has ruined SW if they're going down this route of politicising\\,  and yet at the same time infantile writing. Every time its been opening night till now\\, from now on I'll see them when I see them\\, and will pass on buying merchandise. Disney you've ruined SW. You deserve the cash cow to dry up for this.","true":true}
