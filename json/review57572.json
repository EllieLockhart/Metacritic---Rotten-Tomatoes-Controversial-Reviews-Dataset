Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever created\\, including the prequels. Uninteresting characters\\, poor acting\\, awkward humor\\, an incoherent plot\\, and I could go on and on. Save your money and your time. Go watch Rogue One again\\, whose creators were infinitely more inspired than those who came up with this Last Jedi steaming pile. It was so bad\\, it made the Force Awakens look decent by comparison.","true":true}
