Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half star.  As a standalone movie for some brand new SF series\\, I would rate this much higher\\, but the worst and most unforgivable things about this film are how it relates to the other movies before it and after it.\\n\\nLuke tossing the lightsaber over his shoulder was essentially what RJ did to the franchise with this movie.  RJ threw away the opportunity to take the great start to a new trilogy from the FA and instead combined the prequel movies\\, with a marvel movie.\\n\\nI have 0 excitement to see the future disney Star Wars movies after seeing what they allowed in this movie.","true":true}
