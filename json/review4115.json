Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant subversions of classic Star Wars tropes. Exciting\\, moving\\, and hilarious. An honest self-examination of the franchise as a whole. I am thoroughly pleased with the risks that were taken. A refreshingly messy alleyoop\\, loading the Rebel bases for the next installment to hopefully make a grand-slam-dunk!","true":true}
