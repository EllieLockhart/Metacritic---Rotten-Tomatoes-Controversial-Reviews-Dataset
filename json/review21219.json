Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this after reading terrible reviews\\, and people calling it the worst Star Wars movie ever. Well\\, to my surprise\\, I really enjoyed it. I like the interaction between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, and how they portrayed Luke Skywalker\\, beyond the clich\u00e9 \\\"superhero\\\"\\, Jesus\\, Messiah\\, perfect creature. It was a cool new take that of course\\, it was going to piss off those who want the same stories over and over again.","true":true}
