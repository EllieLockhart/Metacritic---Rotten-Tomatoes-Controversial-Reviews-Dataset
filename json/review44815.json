Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly awful. The biggest disappointment of the year. It actually makes the prequel films feel okay now. How ANYONE can like this movie even a little bit is beyond me","true":true}
