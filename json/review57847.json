Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way to say fuck you to any and all questions the audience had from Force Awakens. I feel like this movie had buildup moments and every single one deflated into a lame ass joke. WTF was the point of the casino subplot? Nothing was accomplished. Felt out of place and Rose just made me angry whenever i saw her face. Her face is fat\\, but she doesnt look fat. Made me think she was storing extra food in her cheeks like a chimpmunk. Anyhow\\, I wasn't surprised by  anything in this movie\\, just confused. It seemed like they had some cool scenes\\, Like Rey and Kylo in the throne room battling those red guards. I didn't think Snoke was gonna die so early on. NO info on him or anything. The way he died was very anti-climatic and just made me think he's irrelevant\\, which is weird cause he was pretty mysterious in TFA. Lots of unanswered questions and seemed to fall flat in almost every scene. Luke \\\"dodging all the lasers was tight. Did'nt bother me he was projecting his image. Him dying seemed out of place as well\\, but it seemed like a good way to go.","true":true}
