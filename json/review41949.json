Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie kicked ass\\, and I have to wonder if all of the haters have simply never watched good films outside of the Star Wars saga. What people keep complaining as \\\"wasted opportunity\\\" or \\\"not getting it\\\" is actually a brilliant\\, total re-examination of the stale formula that has gripped the entire series thus far. I don't want spoilers in this review\\, but the film has a VERY cohesive core point\/message that every single negative reviewer here seems to have somehow completely missed out on (both contextually and in general).","true":true}
