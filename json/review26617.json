Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok i cant stand the critics reviews of movies that they have not seen the movie or may i say had to be paid to say it was good because this was a train wreck from start to finish.  With the bombers that somehow can drop bombs in space to the ridiculous side plot about going to a casino planet made this movie not only bad but cringey to even watch. Critic's gave this movie a 94 % when the fans who payed to see this trash gave it a 40% so you tell me who is honest. Stay away from this pile of space poop.","true":true}
