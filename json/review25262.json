Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No character development\\, very crammed rushed script.  TFA wasnt great mainly due to being fairly unoriginal but it had more space and more human connection and emotion.  If TFA was a 7 out of 10\\, I figured with all that was set up and the characters to work with TLJ should of topped Empire\\, but this is a disaster.  The script made Finn and Poe seem like bad actors where in Force awakens they seemed pretty good.  This movie has no depth\\, no real feeling. Oh well","true":true}
