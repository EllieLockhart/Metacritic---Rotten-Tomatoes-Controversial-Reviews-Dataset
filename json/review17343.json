Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember leaving The Force Awakens slightly disappointed that it was little more than a soft-reboot\\, but despite that feeling I could understand the necessity of such a course of action. Beyond the often-referenced similarities between it and A New Hope\\, there at least was a foundation built that could have been wonderfully expanded on within this new film\\, The Last Jedi.\\n\\nInstead\\, all of it was thrown away\\, and as I left the theater I couldn't believe just how utterly bad this movie was. Wasted concepts and destruction of mysteries\\, terrible humor\\, bad dialogue and writing of characters\\, so on and so on. I won't go into any spoilers\\, but it's apparent this movie was made with marketability in mind\\, rather than creating a substantial addition to the Star Wars universe.\\n\\nI'll also leave a question here for any critics that gave this movie a 3.5 or higher... are you so afraid of the wrath of Disney that you won't objectively review this film? I know Disney has a history of attacking journalists and critics who write anything negative about what they're doing or have done\\, but all of you have an obligation to give fair criticism where it is deserved\\, and The Last Jedi deserves quite a lot of it.","true":true}
