Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is movie was what i needed to stay interested in the series. I love they decided to not go along with what everyone wanted and they made their own vision of the movie and the twist. Yes some of the humor is cheesy with some stupid scenes. This movie kept me interested in star and excited for the next movie. Give this movie time\\, it will become better as time passes and people get used to this new version of star wars.","true":true}
