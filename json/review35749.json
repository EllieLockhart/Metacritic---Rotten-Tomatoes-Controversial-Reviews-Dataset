Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'The Last Jedi' is definitely surprising\\, and takes life-time fans on a journey that feels like a rollercoaster. It contains some of the best moments of the saga\\, but also some elements most fans may not be happy about. To me\\, it feels like a painful but needed break-up: it may end the Star Wars as we used to know it\\, but it opens a new and promising chapter in the franchise. Ryan Johnson may not please everyone\\, but he definitely took his chance and made 'something truly special'.","true":true}
