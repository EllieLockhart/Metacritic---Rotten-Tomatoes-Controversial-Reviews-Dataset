Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am 43 years old which means I grew up with Star Wars\\, had all the toys and have watched all the movies a million times. The last one I watched 3 times at the theater and many more since it opened. THIS EDITION OF STAR WARS I\u2019LL WATCH A MILLION TIMES. i loved it! Not sure why others are soooo negative. It represents a change of guard from the old to the new. Expands the characters and changes the narrative. Go see it. You won\u2019t regret it. I may see you at the theater. LOL","true":true}
