Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it this afternoon\\, two and half hours of drivel and wastes opportunities. Pointless story and characters you couldn't give two hoots about. I was praying for the Empire to wipe out the rebels purely because they're all now just so utterly annoying! Honestly\\, what a pile of tosh. I'd geared myself to not expect too much but Christ it failed waaaaay below my lowest expectations.","true":true}
