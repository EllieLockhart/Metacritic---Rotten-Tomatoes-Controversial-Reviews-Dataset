Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very unique Star Wars movie! I thought it was a wonderful movie!  It was a very fast paced movie with twists and turns that keep the ride fun and exciting!  I absolutely loved the movie!  It is the best Star Wars movie to date in my opinion and I would highly recommend it to anyone!","true":true}
