Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not exaggerating: This is my favorite Star Wars movie. I loved it the first time\\, and even moreso the second and third time I watched it in theaters. The comedy worked for me\\, and the themes were very powerful. I think people didn't like that Johnson was trying to add more gray where there should only be white and black\\, but I liked it. Not everything the \\\"heroes\\\" are heroic in real life\\, and no \\\"good guys\\\" are every perfect. The story allows characters to actually make frustrating mistakes. Also\\, it deserves a high rating just for the beautiful filming on Crait.","true":true}
