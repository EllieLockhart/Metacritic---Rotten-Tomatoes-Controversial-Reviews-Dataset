Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined Star Wars for me and my daughter.  I am usually very forgiving ...but not with something like this.  I don't know how to explain it ...but it seemed like there were a bunch of cool things that didn't fit together in 1 movie.   There was no concise storyline.  They seem to add stuff that they didn't need to just to do something cool.  I can't imagine liking this movie even if your not a star wars fan....it just doesn't flow or make sense. \\nI think my daughter summed it up best at the end of the movie...she turned to me and said ...\\\"Wheres the star wars?\\\"","true":true}
