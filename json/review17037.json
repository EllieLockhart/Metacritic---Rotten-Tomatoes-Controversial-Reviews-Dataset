Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed it. It was exciting and visually stunning. The plot was good and was moving. The acting was worlds above the pre-quels. And contrary to some people's opinions\\, I thought it FELT like a Star Wars movie.  It pays homage to the earlier films\\, and doesn't do violence to their vision\\, and this was important to me\\, as I've been a fan ever since the very first one came out in '77. Very entertaining.","true":true}
