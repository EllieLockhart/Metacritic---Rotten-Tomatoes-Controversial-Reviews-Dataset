Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD:\\n\\n*********\\nThis movie is full of delights and disappointments.\\n\\nMessy disjointed plot\\, cool and mysterious characters such as Snoke are COMPLETELY wasted.  While the first two trilogies felt absolutely like HUGE breathing galaxies.  The force awakens and the last Jedi feel especially small.  You don't get the feeling that a GALAXY is at stake in these movies.  The time Rey spends with Luke is probably one of the biggest let downs in Star Wars history smh.  Go ENTIRE middle hour and a half of the movie could be","true":true}
