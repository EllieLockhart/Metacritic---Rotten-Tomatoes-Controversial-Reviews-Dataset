Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The music\\, technology\\, sounds\\, and visuals were all spot-on top-notch as expected of a something with so big of a budget. This was not the Star Wars we know or grew up with. Poisoned by political agenda and an overall attempt to appeal to a niche audience who likely never cared for the franchise anyways\\, this film is an embarrassment. The character story arcs were lacking in any kind of poetry. This is probably the biggest budget fail of story telling I've ever seen. Shame on Rian Johnson not only for trying too hard to leave his mark on one of the most beloved stories in sci-fi\\, but also forgetting that Star Wars is at its core a space opera. Rest in peace Star Wars.","true":true}
