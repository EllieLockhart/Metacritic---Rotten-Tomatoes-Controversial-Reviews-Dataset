Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It only took me to the end of the 3rd scene to realize that this was going to be a horrible movie from beginning to end. Every time I thought it couldn\u2019t get worse\\, it did. Di$ney obviously only cares about making money and not about its fan base. All I wanted was a Star Wars film written and produced by Star Wars fans\\, for Star Wars fans. What we got was absolute garbage. If you love the original trilogy like it do\\, don\u2019t waste your money on this movie. ","true":true}
