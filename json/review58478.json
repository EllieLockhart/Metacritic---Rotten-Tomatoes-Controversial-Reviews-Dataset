Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A major disappointment.  The story is badly constructed.  Action is derived from superficial plot constructs.  Many of the characters fail to grow or develop through out the story. There are pointless subplots that detract from the momentum of the main conflict.  Social justice commentary and misplaced humorous elements detract from the narrative.  Central questions from The Force Awakens are either ignored or answered in the most underwhelming way possible.  Luke Skywalker is mis-characterized and under utilized in the story. Too many beloved characters are killed needlessly and thoughtlessly. Episode 8 violates the mythos of Star Wars\\, is an insult to its fan base\\, and is unworthy of the films that came before it. Disney\\, if you're reading this\\, please rethink Rian Johnson's future involvement in the franchise.","true":true}
