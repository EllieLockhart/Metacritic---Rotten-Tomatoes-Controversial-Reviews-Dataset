Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every criticism of this film has already been said on youtube by many unhappy fans. Very bad writing\\, unacceptable effects\\, and it does not answer or fulfill all the things we were supposed to be curious and excited for as set up in The Force Awakens. Terrible.","true":true}
