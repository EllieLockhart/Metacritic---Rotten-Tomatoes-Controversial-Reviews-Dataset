Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited until the movie came out on DVD and only watched once. I am not a hard-core fan\\, but I grew up with and loved the original trilogy. I had mixed opinions on the prequels\\, Force Awakens\\, and Rogue One. I critiqued Force Awakens for being somewhat of a re-hash with silly progressive maneuvers in tokenism. 1.) The progressive agenda that I mildly disliked in Force Awakens and Rogue One was doubled-down in this movie to an intolerable degree. The identity politics in casting became distracting\\, as if the director wanted to emphasize just how many women and people of color are in the Resistance. 2.) On a separate note\\, the desire for \\\"a twist at every turn\\\" and subvert fandom became jarring. Established elements and tropes of prior movies were discarded\\, much like a \\\"laser sword\\\" with and elitist disgust. 3.) The use of BB-8 and Porgs became increasingly less clever throughout the movie and were clearly watered-down advertisements.  4.) If the 3 or more story-lines were episodes of a Netflix series\\, the audience score would be much higher. However\\, instead of episodes\\, the disparate plots were thinly connected by a handful of scenes and billed as a single movie.","true":true}
