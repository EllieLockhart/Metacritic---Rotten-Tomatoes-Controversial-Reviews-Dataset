Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi delivers\\, in entertaining fashion\\, a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga\\, which both honors the previous installments while adding plenty of new lore\\, and deftly defies viewer expectations. There are plenty of homages to the original stories to satisfy nostalgia\\, but nothing feels out of place\\, or patronizing\\, as it is tightly woven into the story. While The Last Jedi is the darkest of the Star Wars movies\\, it uses that mood to accentuate the moments of hope. The performances by the cast are among the finest in the entire saga\\, and there are moments of true satisfaction throughout the movie. \\nAnd of course\\, John Williams' score is impeccable.","true":true}
