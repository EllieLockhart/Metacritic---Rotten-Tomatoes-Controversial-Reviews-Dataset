Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. Those who disliked the film are basing their reviews on what they \\\"thought\\\" should have happened in the movie or how they thought the story should go. However\\, that is not really a review of the film\\, it is a statement of discomfort for Star Wars to tread on unfamiliar territory as this film is not afraid to explore new avenues in the Star Wars galaxy. Overall\\, the film itself is a stand alone work of art. There is action\\, humor\\, drama\\, romance\\, and a whole lot of sci-fi adventure. Throughout the film\\, you can vividly see there is a lot of Empire Strikes Back influence. If you go into this film objectively\\, not expecting it has to be a certain way or characters have to be related in certain manners\\, then you will see that this indeed a fantastic science fiction space thriller from beginning to the end. Star Wars The Last Jedi should not even come close to being rated less than 5 stars.","true":true}
