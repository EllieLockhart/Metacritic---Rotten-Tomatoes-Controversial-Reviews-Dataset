Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like I should be writing a eulogy\\, not a review. The movie was beautiful. Stunning visuals and epic battles. But where there is eye candy\\, there is no heart. Characters are empty\\, the movie is bloated\\, and it seems more like a cash grab than a Star Wars worthy movie. My heart is broken with what the franchise has become.","true":true}
