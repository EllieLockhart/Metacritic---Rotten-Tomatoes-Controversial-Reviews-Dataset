Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start? This movie is so awful\\,I can't even remember a single redeeming scheme\\,that wasn't completely ruined\\,by a previous scene.So\\,Rey apparently is the Greatest Force User in Star Wars History\\,so there's apparently no point in watching any previous Star Wars anything\\,because she trumps them all.Oh\\,and Luke Skywalker dreams of killing kids now! Harrison Ford got out at the EXACT right time\\,and I should have left with him.I may be a little late to the party\\,but my Star Wars fandom is over.Thanks for nothing\\,Disney!","true":true}
