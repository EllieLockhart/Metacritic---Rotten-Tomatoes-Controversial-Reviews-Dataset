Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible stiff direction\\, boring plot\\, so glad J J Abrams will be back on board. Comparable to Attack of the Clones. Almost walked out when Leia started channeling Mary Poppins.","true":true}
