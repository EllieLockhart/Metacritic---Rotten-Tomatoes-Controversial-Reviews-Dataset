Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very forgetable movie. Out of a series that i love this is the only that was painful to watch. Larger than life characters became unimportant and are thrown aside. The movie feels dragged out with almost nothing accomplished at the end.","true":true}
