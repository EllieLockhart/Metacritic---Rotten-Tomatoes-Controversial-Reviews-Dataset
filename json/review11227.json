Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly it was just a flop filled with annoying useless characters\\, such as rose who could of been replaced with a severed hand and it would been the same movie. The jokes weren't that funny\\, the acting was O.K.\\, it was way too drawn out and long winded; however the special effects were fantastic. That's about the only credit I can give to this movie.","true":true}
