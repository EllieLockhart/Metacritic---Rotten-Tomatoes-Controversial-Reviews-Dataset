Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but it missed the mark in so many ways. The joking was almost slapstick and lacked the irreverent style of humor from the original trilogy. It felt like they tried to pack in too much from other franchises instead of using the fiction frames of the Star Wars universe. Instead\\, it almost felt like I was watching an expensive but too quickly done knock off of Flash Gordon\\, Guardians of the Galaxy\\, the original Blade Runner\\, Casablanca\\, James Bond\\, and Saving Private Ryan. Also\\, there felt like a number of plot holes from The Force Awakens remained unanswered. I should have just waited for it to come out on video next year.","true":true}
