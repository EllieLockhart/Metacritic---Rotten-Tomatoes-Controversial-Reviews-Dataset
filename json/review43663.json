Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was really dreadful. I won't reiterate points that countless other users have made\\, I just wanted to post this to contribute to the revolt against this shitty\\, vastly overrated film. And somehow reviewers are trying to paint the people giving bad reviews to this film as disgruntled fanboys or racists? Huh? I guess it's my fault that the movie was loaded with pointless filler\\, painfully unfunny gags and poor or underdeveloped character writing. People are wise to the fact that there's a lot wrong with this movie that critics are ignoring and I think there's a chance this movie could really underperform due to poor word-of-mouth. But we'll see I guess.","true":true}
