Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Idk why people are panning this movie. It took things in new\\, different\\, exciting directions and is one of the best Star Wars movies out there. This trilogy has a bit of its own tone and style\\, just like the prequels have their own tone and style\\, as do the originals have their own tone and style. Growing and changing with the times. Each adding their own new characters\\, new creatures and aliens\\, and new ways of telling a story and evolving characters. Some things were not answered in this film but that's ok. That's why there is another movie to fully resolve characters and plot points.","true":true}
