Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No-Spoiler Review: It's a film that often doesn't conform to your expectations of what will or should happen\\, and most of the time in this movie that ends up making it better. It's a darker chapter than The Force Awakens\\, and not everything that happens will make the audience happy\\, but there are some genuinely joyful moments for Star Wars fans. The callbacks to the original series feel like logical continuations of the saga\\, not recycled for nostalgia alone. ","true":true}
