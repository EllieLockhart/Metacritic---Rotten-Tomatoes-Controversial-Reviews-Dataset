It definitely a game that makes you feel miserable playing it. You lose interest in it as the story forces you to do things that are not enjoyable. Its kinda repetitive and the AI is kinda predictable. The 2018 trailer was ofcourse over promised and we got a lesser version from the trailer with the less graphical fidelity. Replayabilty would rate it 2. It was just linear after the first day with Ellie. Story: would rate it 1. Contrived and forced. Joel isnt stupid or dumb in the first game. Why is he dumb in this one. Yara doesnt care her mum died. Wtf. Abby has no redeeming qualities and you just dont care playing this character. No wonder every reviewer gave it 10 as they only were allowed to play Ellies first half. Graphics: 5 I mean\\, it was a letdown compared to the trailer. Reduced self shadowing and etc. I can see why all the senior staff got burnt out and left and only the junior staff were there. The time crunch and you can see the quality fall flat.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
