Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films of the entire series. This challenged patriarchal norms and gung-ho reckless men\\, as well as bringing us a deeper understanding of the Force. It has some excellent character development and the concluding scenes are divine in message and cinematography. This film deconstructs some of what came before in a way that clearly upsets some people but which truly marks it amongst the greats of the entire series.","true":true}
