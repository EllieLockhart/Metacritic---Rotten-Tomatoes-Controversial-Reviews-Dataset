Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incoherent and flimsy plot with holes the size of a star destroyer. The story lacked cohesion and you could have cut some threads out of this you wouldn't have noticed or even cared. You could have easily thrown away the previous movies for the lip service this one paid to them. This movie just doesn't fit in the Star Wars universe. Disney have finally made this into their own franchise\\, some kind of genetic cross-breed with the marvel universe style\\, which I love... IN THE MARVEL UNIVERSE!. Some good acting is wasted on this effort.\\n\\nI've loved Star Wars to this point and queued for early tickets. Never again..","true":true}
