Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for the Last Jedi. I was mostly entertained except for the first hour. The first hour was super boring at some points just explaining what the hell was happening since the Force Awakens. It would have been fine with me if they didn't extend the entire sequence for that long. Overall\\, not a bad movie\\, but not the best in the series.","true":true}
