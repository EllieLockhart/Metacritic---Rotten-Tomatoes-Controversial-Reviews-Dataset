Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the hype to continue the Skywalker family saga was ruined with this movie. No real answers were revealed to anything from The Force Awakens. I waited 2 years for a 2.5hr film about 2 ships following each other. Rey receives no real Jedi training from Luke. No answers or screen time about the rise of Snoke or where he came from. Kylo defeats Snoke with a cheap parlour trick. Luke dies from ???? A brain aneurysm??? Very disappointing.","true":true}
