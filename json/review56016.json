Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Short cuts taken on this film are typical of today's film industry. All CGI and no heart. The death of Luke ends a chapter in the original 9 part Skywalker saga. Followers of the books and movies will feel cheated with Rey's training vs natural ability. Just like in today's world everyone wants a shortcut and doesn't want to put in the time (years) to develope a skill set. This doesnt bode well for the future of the franchise a less you want to sell video games.\\nSkip this one and then the rest!","true":true}
