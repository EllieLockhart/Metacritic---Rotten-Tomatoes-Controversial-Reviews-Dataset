Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just as Luke said in the trailer \\\"this isn't going to go how you think\\\". The Last Jedi takes all of the old tropes of Star Wars and turns it in its head. Mysterious villian that will oversee an Empire and try to turn a character to the dark side\\, killed  and replaced for a better and more fleshed out villain. The character blessed with force powers that your hoping to be from a grand lineage of force users\\, turns out to be born from common folk\\,who abandoned her. There are plenty of others and that's what makes the movie so great. We didn't get a movie we've seen 7 times already\\, we got a breath of fresh air revitalizing a franchise that will undoubted become stale if it is a constant battle of good and evil over and over again.","true":true}
