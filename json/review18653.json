Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It pains me to give one of my favorite franchises such a bad review. Star Wars The Last Jedi was an overly political movie with rushed dialogue\\, plot holes\\, and uneven pace. The biggest atrocity being its confusing disregard for past movies and it's viewer base. It seems the spirit and heart of it's producers died with it as well. Get ready for 9 more!","true":true}
