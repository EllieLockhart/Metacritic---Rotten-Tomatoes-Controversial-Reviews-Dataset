Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah I loved seeing Yoda again\\, but there's so many pointless scenes like Finn\\, and Rose. 1.) Finn and Rose on Canto Bight\\, and taking their sweet time by noticing human slavery\\, and animal abuse by setting free those \\\"horses\\\" \\, and noticing the rich aliens sell weapons to the first order. \\n\\n2) Luke\\, throwing off his lightsaber\\, cutting himself off the force\\, and it's stupid how in force awakens he kept that missing puzzle piece saved in R2 and for a \\\"just in case someone needed to find him\\\"\\, and then it turns out he's a bitter old man who doesn't want anything to do with with anything. ALSO\\, is this even the same Luke Skywalker?\\, the same one who went into a suicide mission to the second death star to find good in the second most evil man who also is father in the Galaxy! Why the hell would he even CONSIDER killing his twin sister and best friends ONLY SON for having this little awakening of the darkness thanks to Snoke.\\n\\n\\nAlso Snokes death was stupid too\\, he's described as the most powerful darksider possibly from the Outer Rim just thrown away by getting killed from this kid who he manipulated for two movies! And didn't take a second to feel or notice he was using Anakins lightsaber against him. \\n\\nUGHHH let me tell you that scene was kind of cool between Luke and Kylo\\, but wouldn't Kylo Ren notice Luke had the blue lightsaber which was officially  BROKEN  inside of Snokes throne room. \\n\\nAlright Bandwagoners\\, I had to vent.","true":true}
