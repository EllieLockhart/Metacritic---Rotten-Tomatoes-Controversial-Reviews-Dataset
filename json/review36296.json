Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The LOST jedi.\\nThis movie looked like the bad ending of a series.\\nThe main characters and villains DIE in the most forced and stupid way\\, questions on previous installments are NOT resolved\\, it adds NOTHING new and uses gimmicks that contradict everything that was established (can't even qualify as plot twists)\\n\\nRogue ONE should be part of the official saga and this should be labeled as FAN FICTION.","true":true}
