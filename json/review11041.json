{"101487":127455,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hello everyone\\, FYI\\, I signed up here just to write a review of this movie.  Unlike many reviews here\\, I will try to be very specific in what I did and didn't like in the movie. I will begin with what I didn't like. (Spoiler Alert)\\n\\n1st Letdown - The humor at the beginning of the movie and throughout unfortunately reminded me too much of the terrible slapstick humor of the first three episodes ...ie..flashbacks of Jar Jar Binks' humor.\\n\\n2nd Letdown - The terrible terrible disappointing fact that Luke Skywalker is just a depressed bum now with no drive or desire to help.... What an awful letdown here guys & girls... does everyone else agree??  I mean the previous movie's ending was such a highlight hinting at the idea that Luke will again be the savior and all powerful weapon against the First Order... but... nope!!... he is literally an introverted bum for 95% of the movie..And what's this? He wants to burn the original Jedi scripts??? What the #*%@?!!! This is sooo unlike what we all have known him to be... OMG such a letdown... such a polar opposite of what we all thought he was and always would be.. Damn what a letdown!!!!!\\n\\n3rd Letdown - The throne room of Snoke and for all intent purposes the character Snoke himself.  Another letdown!!!  Allow me to be specific...in the previous movie he was a mysterious\\, formidable\\, ethereal\\, all knowing\\, giant sized villain spirit that forced us to think about what he truly is and where he came from..... This movie does not answer either one of those two questions.... and seeing his tiny average sized physical form.....made me waaaaaaay less scared of him...Does everyone else agree?  Oh yea\\, and why the bland red curtain in his throne room?  Very plain looking... looked as if the production budget could not afford anything better (although we we know that couldnt be true) and also...when Snoke died\\, no reaction in me whatsoever.. zip zero zilch... which surprised myself.....On a final note why couldn't Snoke realize Kylo Ren was manipulating 2 lightsabers instead of just 1??? Doesn't make sense.\\n\\n4th Letdown and biggest Letdown of all - The camera angles and cinematography of certain key scenes... I don't know about anyone else out there... but there were many moments where I just thought the camera angles and movements of the characters were very amateurish looking... There were many moments that just looked to me like this is a B-movie production.  I repeat\\, there were many moments that just looked like this is a B-movie production. Allow me to be more specific... the way the X-wing flew in the very beginning... the close up of Luke for a half second when he speared the fish\\, the movements of the red uniformed elite guards in Snoke's throne room...\\, plus many more that I just cannot remember.... Here I blame the director entirely.\\n\\nNow in all fairness\\, I will write about what I did like about the movie.\\n\\n1st Like - The length of the movie and the amount of story and events crammed into 2 1\/2 hours.  I personally enjoy longer movies..especially when during a movie you think it is about to end\\,\\, but yet another plot soon develops.. like for example the movies True Lies & Speed.\\n\\n2nd Like - The red salt underneath the ice planet toward the end of the movie.  Now this was awesome.... whomever came up with the idea of adding red salt underneath the ice planet was a freakin genious... it gave the whole scene great added color.. Does everybody agree???? One word... Spectacular!!!!!!!\\n\\n3rd Like - The actress who plays Rey.  Isn't she a beauty?? My god\\, somehow\\, she looks more & more beautiful the more I watch her... whomever casted her as Rey\\,\\, THANK YOU!!!! That decision single handedly helped this franchise immensely.  Now\\, the hormones of all the nerdy geeky star wars fans can have a new female lead to fantasize about after Natale Portman!!  Thank you!!\\n\\n4th Like - Special effects\\, newer model Spaceships & Walkers\\, and overall action.. Special effects were great as expected... newer\\, better-looking and improved spaceships and Walkers to marvel at. And overall action\\, pace\\, and tone of the movie was great... Excellent overall plot... and a decent ending.","true":true}
