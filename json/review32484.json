Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars new movies have been so damn bad I don't know how everyone's okay with these people continually ruining the franchise more and more... even the acting is pretty corny. The plot holes...just save your money. The names of the characters too are so bad. Just bad bad bad. The last Jedi was bad let's face it.","true":true}
