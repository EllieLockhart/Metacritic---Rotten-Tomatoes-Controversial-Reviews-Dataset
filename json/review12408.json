Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came back to change my review to a half star when I found out the lowest rating isn't one star. That should say how I feel about this film. Worst star wars film that I have seen. ","true":true}
