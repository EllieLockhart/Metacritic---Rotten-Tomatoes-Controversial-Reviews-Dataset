Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have the same complaints with this film as everyone else.  It contiuously sets up cool ideas and storylines then lets then fall flat and go nowhere.   Lukes story is awful.   Its a lot of action but nothing to really care about.  plot is not very interesting\\, characters never have much development\\, dumb jokes that come at bad times\\, a lot of things that dont makes sense.  Ive watched several times hoping I will like it but I just dont.  So many great things they could have done but instead its just a bunch of running around and explosions with nothing very interesting and goes nowhere.  So far \\\"Rouge One\\\"  is my favorite out of the new star wars movies.  Dont think we are going to get any real good sequels unfortunatly.","true":true}
