Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that is full of spectacle and enamored with its two lead characters\\, The Last Jedi largely disregards The Force Awakens in order to surprise viewers and damages the trilogy for it. Viewers are left largely in the same place as they were two years ago: thrilled by the new leads in this era but asking many questions about what's really happening in the galaxy far\\, far away and hopeful that the next film can deliver answers that intrinsically satisfy.","true":true}
