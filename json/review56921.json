Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Stars I give are for the fantastic art department. I had very few bones to pick with this movie in an aesthetic sense. The only things that bothered me were the TERRIBLE Porg puppets\\, and horrendous looking Yoda. Yes\\, I realized the rubber bits of him were molded from the original casts\\, but the way it came out in the film looked cartoonish. \\n\\nIn a story sense\\, this movie wasted so much potential. I won't bother repeating what everyone else has said\\, but considering everything that was set up in The Force Awakens\\, it's a shame that Rian Johnson was ironically too prideful to continue the story rather than do his own thing and essentially try to reboot the two-dimensional conflict from the original trilogy. Kylo had real depth\\, and now he's a cartoonish rage monster all of a sudden. Rey\\, FInn and Poe felt like they were taking a back seat to their own movie\\, and the whole casino subplot was boring and unnecessary as shit.","true":true}
