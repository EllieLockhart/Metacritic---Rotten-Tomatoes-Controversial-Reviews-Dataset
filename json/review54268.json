Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get why not everybody is singing this movie's praises. It is slow; it bookends its action to a considerable extent and you feel that more than you might otherwise in a two-and-a-half hour film. And it doesn't give you as much of the fist-pumping moments\\, especially from the old originals\\, as we as fans all can't help but want\\, even if we know better.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nBut this is the strongest thematic work since Empire\\, and maybe of the series. \\n\\nBut we will be quoting the big lines from this one like we quote \\\"From a certain point of view\\\" and \\\"Do\\, or do not; there is no try.\\\" Because they add meaning and context to this universe and these characters\\, and that matters because these characters are now saying something about us again.\\n\\nIt's not a romp. And it doesn't answer all your questions\\, from The Force Awakens or even those posed in this one (although probably more than you think\\, if you look closely; it rewards close viewing). \\n\\nBut it makes the universe bigger\\, which was always the best part of this series\\, and it gives you something (a few things\\, maybe too many if they weren't all meaningfully tied together\\, and they are) to mull over; which\\, even if in vague and general ways\\, the best movies in this series also did. \\n\\nEverybody in it is great. Or very nearly everybody; and man are the the best performances truly top drawer. There's great dialogue. The visuals\\, when they let fly\\, especially when the camera holds still for just that one long moment\\, are stunning. And none of that is a surprise to anyone.\\n\\nBut this movie is a surprise. It surprised a lot of people\\, and that includes me. There are some mild miscues\\, and it bit off more than maybe an audience can chew in one movie.\\n\\nBut it's saying something. It's trying to say something big\\, something bigger than its world\\, something that it thinks we need to hear now\\, and something that is as universal as (if less easily digestible than) Joseph Campbell's wonderful age-old monomyth. \\n\\nAnd I think it succeeds.","true":true}
