Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointment.  Half the move is one big plot hole.  Lets just tackel the big ones.  First\\, is that the first time anyone has ever thought to ram a smaller ship into a bigger one at light speed?  I mean we had 2 movies trying to figure out how to kill two different Death Stars and all this time they could have just rammed it with a ship at light speed?  I mean really?  3 of the smaller ships ran out of fule and just died.  They could have turned around and light speeded into the star destroyers.  What a waste.  Second\\, half the entire movie can be cut because it does not add to the plot.  Cut out the entire part where Finn leaves for his side mission.  It was boring\\, AND it didn't help in any way.  If you think about it\\, Finn was the biggest villin of the movie.  He got more people killed than anyone.","true":true}
