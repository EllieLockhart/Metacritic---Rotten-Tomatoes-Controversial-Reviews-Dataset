Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not perfect\\, The Last Jedi is courageous in some of the creative leaps it takes. It adds depth to Luke Skywalker\u2019s story arc and goes in some unexpected directions. I\u2019m curious to see where the story goes from here.","true":true}
