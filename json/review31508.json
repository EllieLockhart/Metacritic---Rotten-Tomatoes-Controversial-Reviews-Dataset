Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some truly great moments in the movie\\, but I left feeling ultimately confused. I think the film suffered due to the change in director. Johnson didn't care for the hype\\, story or lore of 7 and \\\"tossed it behind his back\\\". \\n\\nA shame for Star Wars fans as no questions were answered. The only thing to redeem this film will be episode 9.","true":true}
