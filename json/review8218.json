Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic portrayal of the latest addition of the Star Wars franchise with enough suggestive hints to keep the audience wanting more. One of my favourites of the series so far. Credit to Rian Johnson and Team for this film.\\nOnly downside is the final scene with Luke... yeah\\, that one.","true":true}
