Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie felt poorly put together. Comedy felt awkward\\, and was not in line with the gravity of the situation. But it was hard to have any connection or feeling for any of the main characters\\, let alone side ones\\, so I guess the writers didn't think the story was critical either. \\n\\nBasically it was Empire Strikes back with shallow characters and huge plot holes. Oh and Jar Jar Binks type comedy thrown in for Disney to sell plush toys.","true":true}
