Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Takes characters both old and new in exciting new directions. It takes what we know about the force and and gives it real meaning. Pacing was a bit off and a side plot or two wasn't too compelling\\, but on the whole it is a bold\\, exciting\\, and emotional film. It is far from by the numbers and most interestingly we see that even the greatest of us can still have some learning to do and hope never dies.","true":true}
