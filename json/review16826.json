Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Instead of Hoth snow\\, they had salt.  Instead of the emperor's throne room\\, they has Snope.  So if you liked Empire and Return of the Jedi ta-da.  This is the mesh of both.  Character development was blah and the story went on too long with the lowest starship chase ever.  I'm a Star Wars fan and was not impressed.","true":true}
