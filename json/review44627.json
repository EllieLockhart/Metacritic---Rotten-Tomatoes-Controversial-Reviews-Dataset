Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally ignores everything set up in TFA. The humor mostly seems out of place and poorly done. It's as if Rian Johnson set out to make the most un-Star wars movie he could just so he could say it wasn't what anyone expected. And as an added bonus he tears down the character of Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
