Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wonderfully complex and diverse lead and secondary characters. Much more depth to each individual and to the relationships. Solid story line that probes into the nature of the Force and doesn't turn to violence\/confrontation as the only suitable manifestation of the Force. Plus a suitable level of humor and silliness\\, especially for younger audiences.\\n\\nWe are long-standing Star Wars fans\\, having seen the original trilogy as adults when it was released. We hoped that Disney would develop the characters and the saga itself in fresh ways to appeal to a new generation. It has succeeded!\\n\\nKudos to Rian Johnson for evoking refined acting performances for all of the characters - and for story development that is rich with promise for our 21st-century audiences.\\n\\nMy grandsons (9 and 13 years old) were breathlessly telling us that \\\"this is even better than any other Star Wars movies!\\\" And that's the reaction we wanted from them\\, falling in love with the saga for themselves.\\n\\nOur 3-generation family LOVED IT!","true":true}
