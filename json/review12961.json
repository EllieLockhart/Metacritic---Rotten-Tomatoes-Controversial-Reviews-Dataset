Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not know where to even begin with all of the ways that this movie sucks. Not fun\\, awkward excessive attempts at humor\\, scenes beyond Jar Jar cringe worthy (space Leia)\\, boring plot devices that have nothing to do with the movie (code master)\\,  Marvel superhero style characters\\, shoddy editing\\, abysmal CGI\\, bizarre pseudo sexual tension between Kylo and Rey.  Yes\\, this movie is worse than Phantom Menace.  Perhaps one of the worse big budget movies ever made. The critics must have been paid off to give good reviews by Disney.","true":true}
