Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haters gonna hate. This movie was a clear step above Force Awakens and Rogue One. Had a couple issues with 1 or 2 scenes\\, but other than that\\, great movie! Also\\, I was in a showing with a bunch of sweaty nerds who were yippin and hollerin all movie long. I think that's a good sign.","true":true}
