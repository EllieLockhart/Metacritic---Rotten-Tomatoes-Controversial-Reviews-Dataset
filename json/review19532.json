Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's unnecessary long\\, but offers some of the most epic battles and character interactions in the saga. Main plot is a unique combat situation not seen before in the saga\\, though it was damaged by some poor dialogues and useless parallel stories that were not even attractive. Silly sometimes\\, but brave and sharp in some others\\, distances from the infamous enormous galaxy led by a small Royalty Family. It invites a broader audience to embrace a fairy tale that used to be only for geeks.","true":true}
