Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was a bold movie by an incredibly talented director. After the first viewing\\, I couldn't quite get my mind to the point where I could comprehend everything we saw. There was so much information and so many twists thrown at us that it wasn't until my second viewing that I could truly tap in to what Rian Johnson was doing. That said\\, it was a great film. Many of these negative reviews\\, in my opinion\\, has to do with fans who spent the last two years developing theories on characters or the plot they wanted to see that they were disappointed it wasn't what Johnson gave them. If you go into it with an open mind and take it for what it is\\, you'll enjoy the ride. It's not perfect. There are still things I didn't really care for\\, but the good far outweighs the bad. It's a new day in the Star Wars saga. The franchise has to move toward the future\\, not continue to rely on the original trilogy. That may not be for everyone\\, but I like the direction it's headed in. Definitely worth going to see\\, but I would recommend multiple viewings. It seems like the kind of movie that gets better the more you see it.","true":true}
