Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now that the newest and final story is out\\, I have a newfound respect and love for this film. It is the only film in the newest trilogy with new stories and ideas which could have ushered in a great and meaningful story end with actual growth. The political slight against The Last Jedi by The Rise of Skywalker\u00a0is one of the most blatant cases of apologetic fan service by a major corporation to the nerd opiate\\, instead of letting the franchise (like many before) finish with the honor of making hard choices\\, good or bad.","true":true}
