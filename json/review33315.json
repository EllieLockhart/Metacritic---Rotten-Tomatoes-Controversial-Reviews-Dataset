Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure\\, it's got flaws but it's still Star Wars. It's about Kylo\/Ben and Rey. The other folks are merely supporting characters. I'm fine with that. All of the disappointment of others comes from misplaced expectation that would have been impossible to meet. It's a movie. A Rian Johnson movie.","true":true}
