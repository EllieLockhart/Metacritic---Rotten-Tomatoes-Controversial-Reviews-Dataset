Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Darth Vader: you will never be cool\\, like your grandfather.\\nKylo Ren: ... \\n\\nThe excitement I had built up for this movie\\, was in fact? wasted energy. I made a RT account today\\, in hopes of warning longtime fans of Star Wars and curious newcomers\\, that this movie is not worth its applause. Regardless of Star War's iconic setting and history\\, it does not excuse the fact that this movie has a 92% rating as of December 25th. It is nearly Impossible to forgive the god-awful script\\, trashed character development\\, unanswered questions\\, humor so bland the actors merely whisper it in hopes that no one notices\\, and finally the mutating mess? that is the multiple story arcs that climb out of the trashcan and embed themselves into this movie. This movie felt rushed. the tacky transitions from scene to scene had me feeling this way. Not only did the film feel rushed\\, but the storyline also felt like it was running a 100k\\, there was very little time for meaningful character development\\, and that little time was poorly spent with little things like bringing Yoda back to burn a tree for the annual 420 memes\\, or the girl who works on pipes to save Fin from saving the resistance (which is a whole other story about hypocrisy I don't have the energy to touch upon.) The saddest part is: they probably could've made this movie feel like a quality movie. The characters that once felt developed in the Force Awakens\\, feel overwhelmingly undeveloped in this film. I could go on for hours about this film. It has its good moments sometimes. Sadly\\, it contains enough bad moments for me to never consider \\\"paying\\\" to see the sequel.","true":true}
