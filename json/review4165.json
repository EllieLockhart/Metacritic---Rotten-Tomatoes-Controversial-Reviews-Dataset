Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Butchered\\, don't know where that 93% from the critics came from. I'm not going to rant about it because I'm sure everyone has already said what I would.\\nTLDR;\\n- A lot of comedy for some reason\\n- Ruined Luke\\n- Many plot holes\\n- Rey most powerful jedi with no training\\n- Snoke got shit on somehow","true":true}
