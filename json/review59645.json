The focus of the first game was on selfishness while the sequel shows how revenge can be a vicious never ending cycle which can claim your soul. The other important thing is to understand why the developers made the notorious second section of the game that people love to hate. The point they tried to make is that there is no good or evil in the world only humans. The other point was why someone\u2019s revenge can be justified whilst other\u2019s can\u2019t.The only reason why they could not make the point is because of the leaks people already hated the second half not even giving it a chance. If you think the game is garbage just because the story unfolds as it does or because what happens to some characters than you missed the whole point of the game and yes whether some people like it or not this game does require some intelligence and a certain age. Not because of the brutality mostly because you can only understand what you see in this game if you have experience in life. You are also required to recognize foreshadowing and metphors to understand what the game tries to tell you. Also some other reviews say that their problem was the large amount of violence made them numb to it. Well that was one point that the game tried to do only they did not realized it. There are so many other heavy topics discussed such as redemption and forgiveness. TLOU 2 is a 25-30 hours soul torturing and it feels awsome. The game is not perfect there are few characters that are kind of one dimensional but I think we seen worse. The game looks stunning and the gameplay is much more enjoyable than the first one. I would describe this as more of an experiance rather than a game and I would strongly recommend it for those who are not judgemental and for those who can look past the thigs that are in front of them.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
