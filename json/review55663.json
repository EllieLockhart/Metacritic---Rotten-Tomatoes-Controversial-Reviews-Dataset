Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my God! Most of the time I was watching the movie I never felt it was a \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie\\, but then some elements came up and reminded me it was! I hate the disneyfication of the franchise( expect for rogue one which was very serious and could of been even more darker if only disney would of let it)\\, I hate the stupid and childish humor put into the movie\\, and the story in my opinion was pretty boring( especially the casino part). The characters were under developed and boring... \\nIn overall i prefer watching a Jar Jar Binks movie than this one.\\n\\\"Betrayed I felt\\\" (Cit. Yoda)","true":true}
