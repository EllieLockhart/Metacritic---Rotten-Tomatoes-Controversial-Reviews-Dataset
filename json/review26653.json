Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK\\, here we go. I like this film\\, but don't love it. Performances are great\\, it's visually stunning and there is one scene that is so badass that it is completely silent. However\\, the Canto Bight subplot is boring\\, Rose Tico makes questionable decisions\\, Holdo's insistence on keeping her plan private is kind of silly and I really feel sorry for Mark Hamill. It was fun though. 7\/10.","true":true}
