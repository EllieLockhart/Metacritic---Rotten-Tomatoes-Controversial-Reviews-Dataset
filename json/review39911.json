Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the WORST Star Wars movie ever.  This new trilogy had an opportunity to reunite the original trilogy cast and really make something amazing and that opportunity was completely wasted. The plot makes no sense and basically this movie disregarded and disrespected everything that came before it in the saga. Horrible job!! What a waste! Negative stars.","true":true}
