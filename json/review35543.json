{"101487":175108,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-12-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi\\, in my opinion is not a bad film. Its an annoying film. As a fan of star wars for the last 20 odd years i have enjoyed all the films in their own way. Even the phantom menace\\, however the last jedi\\, while beautifully shot in some parts\\, with great special effects and a beautiful score\\,   fails in its most fundamental task - at being a Star Wars movie. I think we all got a bit concerned when the main star of the franchise since its beginnings comes out and says \\\"that's not my Luke Skywalker...\\\" \\n\\nSo why is it annoying? There's a few things... \\n\\n1) A huge part of the plot is pointless\\, and I'm talking about tbe Canto Blight scenes with Rose and Finn. The only thing this does story wise is introduce a character that ends up causing more damage to the resistance than thw First Order has managed all film. \\n\\n2) they ruin a beloved character. Now I know why some fans either live this bit or hate it. I was ok wjtb it at first\\, then thought about it a bit. Throughout the original trilogy Luke has tbe ideology of a child - everything will be ok. He keeps this througout the films\\, and even keeps thus idiology that there is good in people right until tbe end\\, eventually redeaming his father. In this film\\, it turns out he tried to kill his nephew as there was darkness in him. Even though his father was a dark lord of the sith and was redeemed\\, apparently his nephew was too far gone... \\n\\n3)There was a plethora of new characters\\, all of while served no purpose..  Rose leads Finn on a mission that gets them in contact witb a criminal that ends up selling them out to he first order. Holdo keeps her plans from Finn so that he sends Rose and Finn on their mission all ultimately dooming the resistance... \\n\\n4) character chemistry that was created in the first film is neither expanded not used. Finn and Rey\\, the standout characters from thw force awakens have all if 30 seconds of scree  time together in this film. New characters that are introduced have no chemistry with the current ones\\, rose and Finn have this rushed forced relationship thrust upon them that just seems shoe horned in so that there can be some love story to continue on...\\n\\nNow there were some good points\\, especially the Holdo sacrifice scene\\, this was a beautiful scene (however if she had actually acted when she should have\\, a lot more ships would have survived). The score as always was top notch. \\n\\nAt least we know that episode 9 cant be any worse. Can it?","true":true}
