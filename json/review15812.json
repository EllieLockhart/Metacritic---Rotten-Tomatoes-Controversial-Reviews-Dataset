Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and this movie was the rebel alliance running for their lives the entire movie. Just bad. Instead of whipping out a movie every year\\, put some time and effort into the plot. You are ruining a great movie trilogy!??","true":true}
