Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this star wars movie. Can't understand those being critical. People reviewing this badly are being overly sensitive. It was exciting\\, funny\\, loved the characters\\, can't wait to see the new ones developed in later films\\, loved the suspense\\, the surprises\\, can't wait for the next one to come out. May the force be with us all!","true":true}
