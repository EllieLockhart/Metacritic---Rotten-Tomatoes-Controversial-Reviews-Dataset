Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Disney murdered Star Wars. This absolutely atrocious film spits on the entire legacy that George Lucas created\\, all for the sake of pushing original characters aside so the House of Mouse can promote and sell new characters and films for endless new films and money. This movie so badly captures the essence of who Luke Skywalker is\\, that at the end it feels like nothing more than expensive fan fiction. Disney killed Han\\, then Luke\\, and didn't even bother to go into character development for Snoke or Random Rey Mary Sue. No need for training or books or years of growing as a character\\, Rey don't need to training or no man. It's a nice microcosm of modern society. Rian Johnson is a hack. You give the keys to the kingdom for STAR WARS to a guy whose filmography is only a few films long\\, having done such blockbusters as BRICK and LOOPER? Please. Spare me. What a waste of Mark Hamill\\, the late and great Carrie Fisher\\, and Harrison Ford. SAD.","true":true}
