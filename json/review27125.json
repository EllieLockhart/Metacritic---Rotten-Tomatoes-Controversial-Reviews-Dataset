Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"one of the worst if not the worst of the star wars series.\\ntoo many things wrong with it.  disney should really rethink whos producing this series from now on.\\nbetter to watch a whole movie of baby anikan and jarjar binks than to suffer through that crap again.\\n\\nnot gonna be spending another dollar in the theater for starwars anymore....too bad since i use to love going to opening day","true":true}
