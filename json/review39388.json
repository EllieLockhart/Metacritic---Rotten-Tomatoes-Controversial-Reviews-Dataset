Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is not awful but it suffers a lot. It has too much plot holes and makes me feel like Rian Johnson saw clips of the Force Awakens. Many of the film's choices were absolutely dumb as hell. But all in all I respect Rian Johnson's vision and the film was mostly enjoyable. I hope for the best in Episode 9","true":true}
