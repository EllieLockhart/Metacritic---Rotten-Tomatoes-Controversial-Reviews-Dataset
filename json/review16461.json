Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm still stunned at how jaw droppingly awful The Last Jedi is. It truly is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! No character development\\, nonsensical plot\\, poor continuity (e.g. the Resistance stated that being tracked through hyperspace was impossible\\, yet the Millenium Falcon was tracked through hyperspace in Ep.IV - Leia even states \\\"They're tracking us\\\")\\, plagiarisation of the previous films\\, etc\\, etc\\, etc. I can't believe how this pile of sh*te ever managed to make it to the screen. No doubt that Disney will keep the SW gravy train a-rolling\\, but I for one won't be boarding again!","true":true}
