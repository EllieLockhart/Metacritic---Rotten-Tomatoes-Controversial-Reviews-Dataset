Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is not a Fanboy Service film.  It's a provocative and daring deconstruction of the Star Wars mythology.  There are developments in this movie that some hardcore fans are going to hate.  As a lifelong SW fan who saw \\\"Star Wars\\\" in a theater at age 7\\, I think Rian Johnson's choices were mostly daring and thoughtful.  I like having my pre-conceived notions challenged and being forced to think about the character arcs.  Here's what I didn't especially like:  the blatant rip-offs of Ron Moore's Battlestar Galactica.  Time to watch \\\"33\\\" again.","true":true}
