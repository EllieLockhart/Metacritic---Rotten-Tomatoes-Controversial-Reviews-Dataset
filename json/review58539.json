I even read that most backlash comes from the fact that the main protagonist (Ellie) is lesbian. What the heck is wrong with people?? There is nothing wrong with being lesbian and we have to get rid of the sexsim in the game industry. I want awesome developed male and female characters. However\\, most games focus on the strong male perception\\, what about the role of awesome strong female characters?In the last of us part 2. Neil Druckman and the entire team at Naughty Dog created pure art\\, and I can't praise them enough for it!I am sincerely enjoying the game\\, and can't wait what happens next.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
