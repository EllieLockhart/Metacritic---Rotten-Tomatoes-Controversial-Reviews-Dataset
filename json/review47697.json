Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first watched this movie I hated it. But looking back I can appreciate it for what the movie did and brought into the Star Wars universe.  Even though it is a bit messy\\, the movie has an important message to tell and exhibits great character growth. Rian Johnson has amazing directing and story-telling skills\\, and while he may say what you don't want to hear\\, it is what you need to know. This movie is akin to the Empire Strikes Back\\, which is why it is my second favorite Star Wars movie of all time.","true":true}
