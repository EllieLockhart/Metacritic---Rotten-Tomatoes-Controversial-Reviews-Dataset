Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie it had a story but not that much action in it but i think their was no action because its setting up for the next movie thats why this movie was slow but good finale fight scene 9\/10","true":true}
