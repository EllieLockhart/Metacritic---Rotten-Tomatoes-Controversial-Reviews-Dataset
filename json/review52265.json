Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Agenda and diversity over quality story with utterly bad handling of the original trilogy characters. Will be surprised if episode 9 can salvage anything after this dumpster fire. Cheers Rian and Kathleen\\, maybe have a look at why the Marvel films resonate much higher with fans\\, take some notes.","true":true}
