Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was very well construced and fun to watch. The low score viewers have been giving is not a knock on the movie but it points out to the disappointment that some hardcore fans had with some moments. This was not the best Star Wars movie ever\\, but it is still a top 5.","true":true}
