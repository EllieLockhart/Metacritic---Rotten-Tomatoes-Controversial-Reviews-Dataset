Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only major complaints I had were Rose's and Phasma's pointless roles\\, Leia's Mary Poppins moment\\, and the pacing in the first half of the movie.\\n\\nOtherwise\\, RJ made a spectacular movie with actual character development rarely seen in the SW franchise and gave the saga a new direction instead of hashing out old ideas again.\\n\\nHigh expectations ultimately killed the audience response with two years worth of fan theory videos and predictions that RJ (probably on purpose) inverted completely\\, showing trailers that purposefully misdirected the audience about every major plot point and its chronology. Fans went in expecting TFA's mysteries to be explained and for better or worse\\, RJ did not deliver. Directors are not beholden to your fan theories and they shouldn't be. We don't need to know who Rey's parents are or Snoke's backstory in this movie necessarily. He gave us a fresh story that played on major themes in SW but also held other themes consistent\\, giving the movie a careful balance.\\n\\nProphecy and destiny are central in the SW films\\, with TLJ reckoning them in four characters: Rey\\, Kylo\\, Luke\\, and Snoke. Rey and Kylo both allegedly saw each other's future; Rey correctly saying Kylo will not bow to Snoke and turn against him - just not in the way she expects\\, and Kylo saying Rey will turn\\, probably in an attempt to lure her with self fulfilling prophecy. This was excellent storytelling for both characters and their development. Luke tried to interfere with Kylo's fate by murdering him\\, incidentally causing what he tried to avoid. For those upset that they don't think Luke would do that.. why not? He was extremely close to striking down his father in anger but stopped at the last second. As he said\\, it was an instinctual reaction to seeing a future he tried so hard to avoid precisely because he achieved balance in the force by not striking down his father. This is a perfect explanation for TFA's mystery as to why Luke fled\\, and why the temple was destroyed. Luke thought it was more prudent to exile himself to avoid further damaging the galaxy \\\"by being a legend\\\". This is reminiscent of Obi Wan and Yoda both\\, who were portrayed as cranky old men who refused to train Luke at first as well. Also of Anakin in the prequels by the Jedi Council. Snoke's arrogance led to his downfall because he thought he had fate and destiny all figured out\\, again a major theme in SW (think: Palpatine). Kylo's betrayal fits in with his character development as he took the only chance he had to kill his master\\, again a major theme in SW of dark side users. Not knowing his origin story left me initially disappointed but in the end wouldn't serve the plot all that well\\, just like with Rey and her parents\\, it doesn't stop me from caring about the characters and their story arcs.\\n\\nMajor complaints that I've heard online (all of my friends really liked it) criticized: \\n\\n- the writing (for me\\, it wasn't outstanding but not prequel-level bad either)\\, \\n\\n- the plot holes (I've seen it five times and still fail to see major plotholes\\, like TFA and literally every SW movie ever suffered from)\\,\\n\\n- the Canto Bite subplot (I'll agree that it seemed to drag\\, totally got its morals mixed up [saving animals but not children]\\, but I loved the contrast we see from Mos Eisley terrible people to rich extravagant terrible people here)\\, \\n\\n- to the pacing (Seeing it five times\\, I'll agree it did drag a bit in the first half but then picked up in the second which more than made up for the difference but if it was any longer it would be way too long)\\, \\n\\n- the humor\\, totally understandable not to like the humor in this and TFA (Whose humor I hated far more than this one's even though I still very much like TFA). It's Disney being Disney\\, and it certainly doesn't ruin the rest of the movie. Not that big of a deal for a kid's movie\\, especially compared to the humor of the rest of SW movies (hint: they aren't comedies either)\\n\\n- to absurd lengths like not realizing ships need fuel or how the shields on the Raddus looked\\, or the hyperspace tracking plot device (hint: new tech is developed all the time)\\, or how the rebels were able to stay far enough away from the FO ships (another hint: play Empire at War and see that rebel ships are always designed for speed over power and imperial ships the inverse)\\, or the bombing sequence in the space battle (a bit understandable given the lack of context for what the bomber's main comparative advantages are\\, although Leia did say it was a stupid idea precisely because they'd get eviscerated but Poe chose to ignore her)\\n\\n- the huge miscommunication between Holdo and Poe. At first I totally agreed after the first two times watching it but came to realize why Holdo wouldn't tell Poe her plan. A) We need to forget that Poe is just another piece in the Resistance\\, not its main leader and he just got demoted. We wanted Holdo to explain herself to him because he is a major character for the audience\\, not as much for the Resistance itself B) Poe just disobeyed a direct order from a general\\, costing them massive casualties and their entire bombing fleet. C) Just as Poe claimed his mission to undermine Holdo was on a need to know basis\\, Holdo's plan would have to be too - it cuts both ways. D) Holdo's logic was to avoid Poe freaking out and causing a mutiny\\, and expected loyalty from her troops\\, which she underestimated. Yes she probably could have avoided Poe's undermining\\, but she didn't. Oh well. Likewise\\, Poe could've avoided killing half the transport ships if he wasn't a hotshot. Oh well. It added a twist to the story and she went out like a badass.\\n\\n- Poe's character development was great because he learned not to always be a hotshot\\, so he figured out Luke being the hero on Crait was a distraction and led the rebels out of the base\\, thinking critically instead of with his cockpit as Leia said. Finn's development was fine\\, going from caring only about Rey to caring about fighting FOR the Resistance rather than just AGAINST the FO. It was alright but Rose's crash was utterly insane in the worst way possible. If you want to fight for what you love\\, don't attempt vehicular manslaughter on it.\\n\\n- Luke's death was poetic and tragic\\, and served the character perfectly. We knew that Luke was stranded on that planet because his X Wing was crash landed submerged in water (some people did not understand this) and redeeming himself as a Jedi temporarily lost his way\\, he projects himself to save the rebels. It was realistically the only thing he could do if you accept the plot point that he wouldn't leave with Rey and Chewie\\, which I do. His sacrifice mirrored Obi Wan's but stayed true to Luke's character by apologizing to his sister\\, reforming himself (just like in VI fighting Vader)\\, and confronting his nemesis who destroyed his dream of a balanced force\\, Kylo. In the end\\, Luke did not back down from the fight to save the galaxy from the FO. The effort killed him\\, but he received maybe the most at-peace death in SW movie history\\, up there with Yoda to finish his character arc as a peaceful\\, defense-focused Jedi. Perfect contrast to Kylo.\\n\\n- Rey being a Mary Sue. I'll reserve criticism until after IX comes out because we don't know the full story yet.\\n\\n- Political undertones and SJW themes. I hold a bachelors in politics and I tend to overanalyze movies for their political background and themes. I saw very few undertones that wouldn't already be present (Episodes IV-VI overtly feature a dictatorial regime being overthrown by republicans) and it doesn't really apply to modern day political life regardless. Further\\, SJW references and themes were nonexistent\\, sans purple hair in Holdo. Yet\\, no references to gender roles or diversity were made at all.","true":true}
