Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At best you can say this movie is \\\"entertaining\\\"\\, and casual Star Wars fans will likely agree it's not a good \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie which is essential here because this movie is a massive shift in the Star Wars trilogies - that's certainly why it's so divisive. But nearly all hardcore Star Wars fans I spoke to agree that it's not a good shift. In fact\\, it's downright awful. This is beside the fact that if we were to remove the plotline and characters of this film and place them in an alternate universe\\, it would not fare well. It certainly doesn't fare well as a sci-fi film with a nonchalant treatment of physical reality to fit the plot-line\\, not even in ways that fit the original IP or how it's been developed. It's too late for people to not support this film\\, it's already paid for itself\\, but hopefully the backlash will come for Episode 9.","true":true}
