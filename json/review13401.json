Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the main plot and the subplot. I especially liked Mark Hamill's performance. Many Star Wars themes are replayed with interesting twists. I can't wait for the next movie.","true":true}
