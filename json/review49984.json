Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You \\\"subvert expectations\\\" by taking a story in new and unexpected directions\\, not by having established characters act like entirely different characters or just randomly abandoning every single possible plot point. That's not subversion. That's a piece of shit story.","true":true}
