Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed bag for me. Lots to like\\, some stuff to love\\, and some stuff which\\, like TFA\\, made you go.... \\\"Why? Why have that?\\\" or \\\"Why not save that for later?\\\"\\n\\nTo be brief\\, the film has flaws which are\\, unfortunately\\, quite glaring. But to its credit\\, the film also takes a lot of risks to tell its story. It doesn't give the fans everything they want. It follows its own path\\, take it or leave it.","true":true}
