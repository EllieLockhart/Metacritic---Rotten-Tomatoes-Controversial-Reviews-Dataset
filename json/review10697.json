Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some very very good parts. There was a disgusting amount of unnecessary comic relief that created awkward pacing as well as ruined the mood of entire scenes. Plus some very hefty plot armor on several characters. This movie came close to making a huge step away from the norm that these Disney backed movies fall into\\, but in the end fell victim to the same problems that suck the life out of the Disney movies.","true":true}
