Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They assassinated Luke's character before he died. I've been a Star Wars fan since 1977 and this was the worst film in the series. Poor plot and terrible execution - the only good part was Adam Driver. This sadly will be the last Star Wars movie I see. I miss George Lucas.","true":true}
