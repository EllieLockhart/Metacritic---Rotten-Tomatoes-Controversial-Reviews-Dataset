Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is visually stunning\\, but visuals do not save a film. There are clear plot holes all over. The time spent on the casino arc could have been easily spent on developing Snoke's character (btw\\, terrible acting in the casino part). The most amazing thing about TLJ is the critics. How could they missed\/accepted all those plot holes? That shows that critics were rigged. Something to be remembered for any Star Wars work to be release by Jonhson. Second most amazing thing: Disney has given him a new trilogy to direct. It's risky given that Jonhson is now persona non grata for fans. He still thinks he did everything right\\, which is kind of arrogant. Maybe he should have directed a Star Wars Story\\, like Rogue One\\, where he would have had the freedom to mess around\\, without impacting the current trilogy. Unfortunately\\, episode IX will have a hard time filling the holes or will need to be an even longer movie.","true":true}
