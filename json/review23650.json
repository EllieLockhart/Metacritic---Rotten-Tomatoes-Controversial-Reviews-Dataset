Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love the Star Wars movies but this one isn't too good. Hamil & Fisher are not very good actors in this film. The special effects are good though. I wouldn't say NOT to go see it but be prepared to be disappointed.","true":true}
