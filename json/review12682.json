Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could have enjoyed the dumb jokes if they weren't always undercutting serious moments.\\nI could have enjoyed the bland characters if they weren't always alternating between Chaotic Stupid and Lawful Stupid.\\nI could have enjoyed the the villains if they posed any real threat.\\nI could have enjoyed the heroes if they had any real character development.\\nI could have enjoyed this movie if it wasn't just a subversive\\, poorly-planned\\, nihilistic mess.
