Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan I can say this is the worst movie of the franchise. I hope Rian Johnson is fired and never allowed near another stars wars film. Whoever was involved in the making of this movie should also seriously take a look at why they want to be involved with Star Was because they obviously don't care very much for the story or its characters. Utter garbage\\, a total waste of money. Please strike it from cannon. TFA was really good. Rouge one was awesome\\, Rebels is excellent. Please explain wtf happened here\\, how did this happen??","true":true}
