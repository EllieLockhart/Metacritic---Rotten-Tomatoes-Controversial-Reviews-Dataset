Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would explain\\, but all you have to do is read any of the other reviews on here that are 1 star or less and you'll get why I HATED this movie. JJ Abrams is going to have a super hard time cleaning up Rian's disastrous mess. I know JJ won't let us down becasue TFA was actually a great movie.","true":true}
