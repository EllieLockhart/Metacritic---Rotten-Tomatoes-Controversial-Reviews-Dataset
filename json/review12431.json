Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can definitely understand why a lot of fans seem to be having a mixed reaction to this film. I would bet that the reason for that mixed reaction is the very reason I really enjoyed it. This is the best made Star Wars movie there is. Don\u2019t get me wrong I still love the original trilogy and rate the first two higher. Just because it\u2019s different doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. If it weren\u2019t for the\\, admittedly very bad\\, section with a casino town this would be at least 4 and half; maybe even 5 stars. I also think Johnson created one of the most technically beautiful and stunning images\\, not just in Star Wars; but of all time... you will know it when you see it!","true":true}
