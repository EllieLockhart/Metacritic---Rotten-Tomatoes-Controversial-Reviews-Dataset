{"101487":175677,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi sucks!! A huge disappointment for star wars fans the world over. Poor script\\, main characters under used in the movie\\, new character additions to the story pointless and uninteresting \\, snoke looked like a character \\n of harry potter\\, not as good as the excellent rogue one and force awakens. 2 stars **","true":true}
