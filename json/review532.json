Are running smoothly with the horror theme environment and help you get in the mood.\r\rGAMEPLAY: I will start again with a comparison. It is not Last Of Us but the storytelling is the strong point of this game. You are getting attached with the characters and your choices are really matter. They change the course of the game. It really stands with the greatest games of this genre like Fahrenheit\\, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Lost Souls. The movement of your character is good (not perfect) and the fixed camera sometimes does not help when you are moving from a plan to another. But fixed camera has its own meaning. Puts you deep in the game and scare the s@#t out of you. With very little interaction in the game you have the feeling that you do so many things.\r\rSUMMARY: BUY IT. A very nice game and satisfaction guaranteed. I really do not understand people that they hate it. It is not a masterpiece but the game still is great.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
