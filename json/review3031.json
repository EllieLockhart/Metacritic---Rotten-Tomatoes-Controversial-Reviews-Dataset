Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad or borring storytelling\\, a lot of scenes that don't work and both porg and bb8 are there only to sell toys. Only good part is Rey\/Kylo arc.","true":true}
