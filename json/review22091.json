Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kept many themes of Empire and Jedi\\, and then branched out in new and unexpected ways. Lukes progression was great and expected based on the facts from Force Awakens. I believe many people expected simple a re-telling of Empire (Like Force Awakens mirrored New Hope) but they are no longer running straight copies of the previous films. Not a perfect film\\, but I believe they did the franchise justice.","true":true}
