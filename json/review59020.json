The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The sequel everyone has been waiting for\\, end up being the sequel no one wanted.\r\rThat's how I feel\\, I did not expect this story to be told. Why? mostly because a whole game based on the \\\"cycle of violence\/revenge\/forgiveness\\\" (and not going at it the right way) and not focusing on the zombies\\, cure\\, or a better world building\\, well kinda a miss for me. But still very good and a rare experience.\r\rWhat's my problems with this sequel? The characters mostly. Abby (\/Owen). I don't hate her. I get what was the point of her story\\, why we played her. I do\\, but\\, it just doesn't work for me.\r\rCould be because\\, we play her after 15 HOURS\\, you know when we are very invested in Ellie (can't be compared with how we get play Ellie in the first game). Maybe because we play her after a big cliffhanger\\, and get back to it after hours. Maybe because we see her kill and torture XXX. Or maybe because her and Owen story felt bland\\, boring\\, long? I get it\\, we need to sympathize with them. But not like this (I did like Abby with Lev and Yara\\, it was interesting).\r\rAnd we spend quite a few hours playing Abby\\, when other characters get almost nothing. Dina\\, Tommy\\, Jesse and Maria.\r\rEllie loses everything\\, even herself (PTSD\\, not explored or talked about) for revenge. In this game the characters don't talk a lot about their feelings or what happened\\, it's missing\\, we have visuals but... Even worse\\, if you miss an entry in the journal\\, you might not understand correctly Ellie.\r\rThat being said\\, it's still an amazing experience. The gameplay is really good when given the opportunity. The graphics are a big step up\\, for me\\, it's the character animations that I liked the most. Again story not perfect for a few things\\, but for the rest it was good. The flashbacks could have been handled better\\, sometimes it was frustrating\\, more so with Abby. And lots of options to play how you want in the settings.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
