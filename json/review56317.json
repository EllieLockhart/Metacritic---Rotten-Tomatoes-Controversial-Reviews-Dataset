Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointing experience. For me it squandered all the promise of The Force Awakens\\, dropping any story threads of interest\\, it's as if the director never saw a star wars movie before. He shows no empathy for the characters and no understanding of the spirit that makes Star Wars what it is. Oh it's full of cheesy marvel style jokes as well that rarely hit the mark and often ruin tense moments. It all feels like just another generic blockbuster. The Last Jedi has sucked all the interest from this trilogy for me.","true":true}
