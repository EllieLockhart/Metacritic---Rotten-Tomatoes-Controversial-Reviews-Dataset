Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't want to rant on this\\, but it's bad when I have to remind myself the movie I'm watching is a Star Wars film at the end. The humor made me feel like I was watching a Marvel movie\\, the plot holes were ridiculous\\, they made the force seem like it could do anything\\, or anyone can use the force\\, and they unnecessarily killed Luke. That's just the tip of the iceberg.","true":true}
