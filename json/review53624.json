Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlikable from start to finish\\, 4th wall and canon-breaking. The movie is a disaster that seems like it was intended to make it as difficult for disney to follow up with another star wars movie. Pointlessly virtue signalling at the worst times while needlessly killing people with no feelings attached at the best times..  2 stars for the concept art. Thats about it.","true":true}
