Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really want to love this movie and there are moments that I did actually think were exciting\\, yet as I walked out of the theater I realized that was the problem. This is a visually beautiful movie with enough cool scenes to make you forget about the pile of unanswered questions\\, useless subplots\\, and a tragically uncharacteristic portrayal of one of the franchise's most beloved characters\\, Luke Skywalker. Although heavy in \\\"content\\\" it leaves only a strange feeling of \\\"what did I just see\\\" and what's the point of Ep 9?","true":true}
