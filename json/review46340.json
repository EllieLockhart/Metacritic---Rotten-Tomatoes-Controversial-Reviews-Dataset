Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was it perfect?  nope.  Dragged a little in the middle\\, tried to give some characters pointless stuff to do.  Is any Star Wars movie perfect? Nope.  This movie took risks\\, and ultimately it rocked.  I was giddy coming out.  People are so focused on the questions that weren't answered- parents\\, snoke\\, knights of ren.  They seem to forget there is another movie still to come.  Plus in the originals\\, we never got even a single word explaining who the emperor was\\, what exactly the jedi did\\, who luke and leia's mother was (other than she was very beautiful and sad).  People are too focused on the little things and answering all the questions and kind of missing the point.  The problem everyone had with the prequels was they explained things to death.  People HATED those movies until it became fashionable to say they actually weren't that bad\\, mostly because the new films are so universally love. The movie took risks\\, and it felt like its own fully realized Star Wars movie.  Plus force projection\\, Benicio Del Toro\\, Reylo\\, and light speed through a star destroyer were all pretty great additions.  I can't recommend enough.","true":true}
