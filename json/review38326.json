Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE WORST IN THE FRANCHISE!! Give me Jarjar and midichlorines over this crap!  Storyline makes no sense\\, completely destroys the entire mythology of the force\\, who can use it\\, it's powers\\, when its used\\, etc.  Darth Emo sucks as a villain.   Leia Poppins\\, omg.  Fuel supply storyline- let's talk logistics!!!!  And the worst sin of all\\, using a line of dialog to invent something (a new technology in this case) in order to cram events to fit the storyline.","true":true}
