Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie I've ever seen. I'm not going to bother going into detail because the on denial fanboys and paid off critics will still just call it a troll after I put the effort in. My advice wait until you can stream it if you want to watch it and don't give Disney any of your hard earned cash because they do not deserve it for producing such a steaming pile of s**t.","true":true}
