Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pacing issues made the first half drag on and the second seem like a race to the finish line. An overabundance of humor seemed around the corner of every serious statement. Why act like Leia has died just to have her spend most of the rest of the movie unconscious? Not even the well choreographed lightsaber duels could save this film. Overall it felt more like a mediocre video game than a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
