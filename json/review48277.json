Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why do star wars fans hate star wars so much? Look\\, it was a nice ride. Rose is a nice character but not superb. The movie could've been better but it's not as terrible as many people make it seem.","true":true}
