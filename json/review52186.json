Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After walking out of the theatre I to wanted bellow in anguish.   This movie appears to be a \\\"troll\\\" by my best estimation. Luke was a fearful old Alzheimers patient who died like a sad but forgettable accident. Snoke was desperate and tryhard\\, all intimidation weight and curiosity associated with him died upon his first frame of screen time. Every single fight scene had the athleticism and choreography of flailing children. This is a pretty skin on a movie unworthy of the Star Wars brand.","true":true}
