Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I like the nuanced look at the force\\, moving away from the simple \\\"multimate good vs ultimate evil and you are either all one or all the other\\,  which frankly is unrealistic AND has bee beaten to death in fiction\\, and how two people can have different experiences of the same event. \\n\\nI also enjoyed the character development that took place outside of the main thread. These are interesting people! \\n\\nThere is some lame stuff\\, like the \\, oofy bird critters\\, and Yoda and Luke being a bit too flip about some things\\, but over all\\, this was really good. \\n\\nStar Wars cane out when I was 10 and really like this new approach.","true":true}
