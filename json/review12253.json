Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot\\, just a disgusted viewer.  The plethora of reasons I was unhappy with this movie have already been discussed on this site ad nauseum. \\n\\nI'll just say that my 3 biggest complaints were:\\n1. Terrible attempts at humor\\n2. Pointless\\, boring Rose and her story\\n3. Blatant SJW themes\\n\\nDisney and Rian Johnson were given a golden egg here.  A storied saga with a built-in fan base in the tens of millions.  That they gave us this movie in return is just one of the biggest disappointments I\\\"ve endured in awhile.","true":true}
