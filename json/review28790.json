Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite simply the worst of all of the Star Wars films. A disgusting mess with no respect for the lore set behind it\\, exposes the film behind the fantasy and pulls you completely out of the viewing experience. Also filled with nonsense Social Justice moments and awkward\\, hastily written scenes that make no sense going from one to another. \\n\\nA Travesty of modern film making. ","true":true}
