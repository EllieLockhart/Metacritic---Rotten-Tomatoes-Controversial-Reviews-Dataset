Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was very entertaining and a treat for the senses. It was also a marked improvement from The Force Awakens. That being said\\, it is still hamstrung by a lack of character development for the main characters. Luke Skywalker deserved more and better treatment. Rey is the lead character\\, but this makes 2 movies with almost no development of her character and back story. And the Snoke character wasn't developed at all. The journey is more important than the destination\\, but this movie seems to be rushing through some of the key parts when it should slow down and linger a bit. Some of the fluff could have been trimmed a bit to allow for richer story-telling.","true":true}
