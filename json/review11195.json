Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly everyone out there trashing this movie are just being winey\\, the movie was fantastic\\, although I wish that he hadn't killed Luke off I accept and respect Rian Johnson's desicion\\, all in all the movie had great twists and plot structure and while there were some needless additions to the plot (Rose) it was still a great film overall. To everyone hating on the movie for Rian Johnson's desicions grow up and deal with it\\, a movie isn't terrible just because your favorite character died","true":true}
