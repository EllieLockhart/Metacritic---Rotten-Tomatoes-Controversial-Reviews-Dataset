In my opinion\\, it would have been better if they had made the scenes shorter and had dubbed the game to English or put subtitles in other languages because for non-native English speakers it's very easy to \\\"disconnect\\\" and stop reading. I ended up skipping so many dialogues even some of the main story. About sidequests most of them are funny so feel free to do the sidequests when you feel to. I played this game for 47 hours spending many hours on minigames and sidequests so it can take about 30 hours or less if you go straight to the main story. To sum up\\, this game wouldn't deserve more than an 8. I had Yakuza 6 in my wish list but I deleted it because with one Yakuza I had more than enough. I'd only recommend this game for Japanese and English people.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
