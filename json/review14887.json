Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly think this movie is a collection of missed chances wrapped in a very expensive and flashy package. Almost every plot point was cheaply concluded\\, answering questions with out of place humor and prequel style bluntness. I think they handled characters poorly and cheapened a lot of the lore and mythology that made this franchise great. Maybe I'm just taking it too seriously\\, this is a good movie if you just want some popcorn but I wanted a great Star Wars movie and this just didn't do the job.","true":true}
