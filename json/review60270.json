Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I liked the game but didn\u2019t love it. At times it was everything you could want. At other times\\, it felt like a hard slog. I think it could have been reduced by 4\/5 hours.There were clearly a lot of ideas that were put into the game; some great\\, some not so great. Fair play to ND for expanding TLOU universe but they could have probably held some ideas back. Part 2 improves on everything except the story and pacing for me. It was never going to be easy to top Part 1 either.Part 1 flowed better because you play it mostly as Joel\\, with Ellie by your side. It progresses nicely towards its conclusion. You care a lot more about the characters and what happens to them.Even so\\, I can understand why Joel was killed. It gave the game purpose. The manner in which he died has clearly infuriated people and I can understand that. Joel wasn\u2019t perfect by any means but we rooted for him. I\u2019m not sure if we were supposed to ever like Abby. I think playing as Abby was purely to try and understand her struggles and what she had been through. We have to remember that she has lost people too.For me\\, I would have preferred to play Day 1 as Ellie\\, then Day 1 as Abby and so on\\, so forth. There was such a big moment in Ellie and Abby finally meeting after the death of Joel and then we kind of lost that momentum as we were forced to play as Abby for a long period of time and go through parts of her story.What TLOU does well is show us that there are no heroes or villains. People are just trying to endure and survive. The level of detail is incredible and one of the best additions to Part 2 was hearing people scream out their friends name when you took them out. It added weight to the decisions you were making.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
