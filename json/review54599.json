Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really baffled to see some critics praising this film as \\\"brilliant\\\"\\, paid off maybe? I don't get it. Disney is coming across as a soulless money grubbing company in their approach to Star Wars. PC casting? Check. Bad forced jokes that feel completely out of place in a SW film but would fit in a Marvel film? Check. Same space fight scenes from last film? Check. I will not be paying to watch another SW film at this point. As others pointed out\\, at times it felt like Spaceballs the sequel.\\n\\nWriting was terrible with a number of ridiculous scenes (Luke milking some weird Alien cow thing? What the hell)\\, the pacing meandered all other the place\\, the plot was non-existent.  The villains were generic and forgettable. Call backs to earlier films were superficial and blatant with no substance. The characters had no depth\\, were we supposed to care about anyone in this film? It's like Disney execs had a checklist to go through but didn't care about making a legitimately entertaining and coherent Star Wars film. I kind of hate Disney at this point.","true":true}
