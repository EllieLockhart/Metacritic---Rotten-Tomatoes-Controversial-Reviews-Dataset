Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quick Hits:\\n\t9.4 Out of 10\\n\tUses the Nosteglia of the force awakens to set up misdirection which makes for a great story\\n\tZigs when you think it will Zag\\n\tIntroduces new characters and develops creative ways at allowing protagonists and antagonists (good and bad guys) to dialogue with each other without the looming threat of combat. \\n\t\\n\tSet aside the opening dialogue between Poe and the General\\, which was a failed attempt at terrific JJ Abrams banter between Poe and Kylo Ren at the beginning of the force awakening (seriously the opening dialogue was cringe worthy bad-I think Disney had their hands in reshooting because they didn't want the movie to start so dark)\\, and the movie is everything you want it to be. My initial impressions were not that...Leaving the theaters I wasn't sure how much I liked the movie--it wasn't really the nostalgic joy ride that I was expecting. Sitting here less than 12 hours later and I realized that this movie was GREAT because it played on my anticipations-zigging when I saw it was going to Zag. While The force awakening uses Nostalgia to tug at our heart strings and reintroduce us to the galaxy of star wars\\, Rian Johnson builds on the first movie by employing nostalgia as a plot-twisting device. Johnson lures you into a familiar Star Wars story arc\\, counting on you to nostalgically anticipate the arcs direction like in \\\"Awakening\\\"\\, only to surprise you with a drastic redirection of the outcome. \\n\tThis movie is just like my relationship\\, just when I think I have my girlfriend figured out and I start to feel a familiar situation approaching\\, she (un)intentionally reacts in a completely different way throwing me for a loop. Lets not get carried away\\, this movie is not one big misdirection\\, it also gives us tantalizing character interactions by building on the forces ability to allow opposing main characters to speak to one another like they are having a skype conversation. It also introduces us to great new characters like Rose Tico. Unlike any other movie in the star war saga\\, there are many subplots within the entire movie. The main characters are all separated and remain separated until all reunite at the very end. While misdirecting and building upon the other movies\\, The Last Jedi shares similarly traits to the empire strikes back. The Rebels are in a full retreat the entire film. In addition\\, the empire lays a trap and attempts to get a young jedi to come and rescue another who is seduced by the dark side\\, a la the return of the Jedi. Yet the movie has its own play on this aspect as well\\, completely diverging from the plots of empire strikes back and return of the Jedi.  Instead of just a few characters on the run and being chased (Solo\\, leia\\, chuwee\\, C3P)\\, it is the entire rebel fleet! Instead of wanting Rae as a apprentice\\, Soke wants to bring Luke out of hiding to kill him.\\n\tThis move is everything that you didn't think you wanted but that you then come to understand that you needed from Latest Star Wars Installment... Kind of like having kids-except the opposite way around.","true":true}
