Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams' Episode VII lazily imitated the tropes of the original Star Wars trilogy while ignoring the conclusion of Return of the Jedi. Rian Johnson's Episode VIII goes one step further\\, actively violating and destroying the character of Luke Skywalker clearly depicted in the original trilogy. It is a smug\\, cynical\\, disrespectful\\, amoral\\, proudly ahistorical and assertively ignorant film.\\n\\nI'm not a Disney hater or even a multinational corporations hater. I loved Rogue One and I love Rebels. (Thank you Disney for both!) Episodes VII and VIII are just terrible films. And they're the last Disney Star Wars episodes I'll be watching.","true":true}
