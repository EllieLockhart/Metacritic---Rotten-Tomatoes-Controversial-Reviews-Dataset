Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hmm still pondering over this movie. Definitely better than JJ\u2019s mess (7) but not extraordinary. I\u2019m done pondering and what a disappointment. It had its moments & potential but it failed. Disney is definitely out with the old & in with the new which is too bad. Now JJ is at the helms again to sink SW for sure. ","true":true}
