Destroying the Legend of the Old Movies und making it a Fast & Furious Action Scene after Action Scene Movie\\, with a shitload of dumb Jokes. Yeah you giggle often but most of the Time your laugh gets stuck your throat\\, after realizing you are watching a Star Wars Parody made by Will Ferrel!","true":true}
