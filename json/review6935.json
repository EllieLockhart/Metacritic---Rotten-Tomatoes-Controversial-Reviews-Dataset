Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily among the worst Star Wars movies\\, if not the worst (stiff competition with the phantom menace).  Incoherent story line\\, forced humor\\, lack of any character development save for Kylor Ren\\, unexplained or poorly explained crucial plot points\\, but good action.  I would say this movie tried WAY to hard to convince people it wasn't going to follow the empire strikes back...but it turned out to be a copy of five\\, four\\, and six with added agenda and other nonsense in a shell of disappointment.","true":true}
