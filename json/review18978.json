Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's better than The Force Awakens that's for sure. But being better than a piece of shit doesn't make it good.\\nWith a 2h30 running time\\, it seems like it lasts for ages. The structure doesn't make sense\\, half the scenes could be taken off without any impact on the story and the characters returning from the old movies are sullied beyond measure. Almost no explanations are given for a lot of questions The Force Awakens asked. It may not be the worst Star Wars film but it's definetely the most boring.","true":true}
