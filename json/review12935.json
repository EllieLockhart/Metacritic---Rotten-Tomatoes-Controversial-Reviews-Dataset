Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd like to find this \\\"critics\\\" who give a 93% fresh rating and wipe their face in the pile of crap I just watched.  It's like Rian Johnson took my childhood and wiped his ass with it.  I can't trust Rotten Tomatoes anymore after this wildly divergent representation of the truth.  The movie the critics claim to have seen is NOT the movie everyone else saw.","true":true}
