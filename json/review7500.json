Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every addition to the franchise just makes the whole thing that much worse at this point. There are so many plot holes\\, inconsistencies and unresolved points that it weakens everything that came before. It's a mess. Please just stop. \\n\\nFor all of that it looked sort of cool and by the end of the film I sort of cared what happened to the characters. Not so much that I will be eager for the next installment.","true":true}
