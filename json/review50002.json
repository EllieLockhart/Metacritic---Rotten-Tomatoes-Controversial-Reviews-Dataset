Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You won't find Luke Skywalker in this Film. Only an Edgy Luke Rian shoehorned in to create drama. The Empire v The Rebels is still a thing in the most boring chase ever. Rey is confirmed to be a Mary Sue. You will hate the Asian bitch. There are plot holes all over. Canto Bight will be you're least favorite part of the Movie\\, i know it is for me. Leia fly's through space and lives. Snoke's character is pointless and i wonder why anyone thought he was a good idea. You will find more OT material stolen by Disney's trilogy. It Sucks is what it boils down to.","true":true}
