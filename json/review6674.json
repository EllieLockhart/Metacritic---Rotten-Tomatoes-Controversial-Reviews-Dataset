Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t bother seeing this movie. As a stand-alone film it was incoherent at best. As a continuation of the Star Wars franchise it is insulting. This movie if filled with moral relativism that has no place in this fantasy universe. Also\\, as another reviewer said there\u2019s absolutely no magic. Johnson should be ashamed of what he wrote and directed. I hope the Disney execs are happy with the money they fleeced out of generations of fans for this turd of a movie. ","true":true}
