Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was wholly underwhelming.  I found the whole plot to be lackluster and unnecessarily convoluted at best.  The acting was poor to say the least.  The movie really just dragged on and on.  It was a poorly paced movie all around.  All of this occurred within the time allotted for the fleet to run out of fuel?  It also started off by saying the resistance fleet was faster (at sublight) but they never got any further away from the First Order fleet.\\n\\nThere were good moments though.  The Rey\/Kylo fight with the guards was awesome.  I disagree with all the people crying Mary Sue just because she can fight.  Seriously\\, she already showed herself to proficient in TFA in melee combat before ever picking up a lightsaber.  (Yes\\, fighting with a staff is different that fighting with a sword.  I teach them both).\\n\\nMost of the humour in the movie I appreciated\\, though the scene of Skywalker playing with boobs was totally gratuitous and unnecessary. Seriously\\, it did nothing to drive the plot of the movie and should have been left on the cutting room floor.\\n\\nThe greatest \\\"feels\\\" I got from the movie was from the Porgs watching Chewie eat their buddies.  \\n\\nOverall\\, I left this movie with the reaction of \\\"Meh\\, it was ok.\\\"  It wasn't a bad movie\\, but it definitely wasn't a good movie.  It goes right to the bottom of the list for my rating of the best Star Wars.","true":true}
