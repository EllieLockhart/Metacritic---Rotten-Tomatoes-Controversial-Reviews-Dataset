Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave this movie one star. It deserves less\\, but Flixter won't count it if you give it less. This is one of the worst movies ever made\\, and the absolute worst Star Wars movie ever made. There is so much wrong with this movie that it would take pages and pages to even get close to explaining what was wrong. Visually beautiful with absolutely no substance.I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The critics got this one wrong\\, big time.","true":true}
