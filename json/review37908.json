Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These aren't my only thoughts\\, but this movie was so much fun. It both met and twisted so many of my expectations about the universe in ways that made me think not only about Star Wars\\, but also about how those thoughts apply in the real world. Empire did that too! So did RotJ\\, even! The movie is GORGEOUS. Hamill is phenomenal.","true":true}
