Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For real look at this user score. This is the problem today in movies. People beg for originality and creativity and when they get it\\, guess what? They hate it or spit on it. This is the reason why we don't get original ideas\/concepts. Alright onto the film. First of all the actors and performances were all incredible\\, but Mark Hamill steals every single shot when he is in frame. Also Daisy and Adam are incredible. They better be right? They are the lead roles after all\\, but well done. The movie looked incredible down to every detail in design\\, costumes and CGI\\, and you can not forget about the creature models\/designs. Some of the best creatures I've seen in a movie in a while. The story I felt was really engaging and felt more complete this time. It felt more of a fantasy and oddly enough a thriller at least to me. It has all the Star Wars fighting\\, lasers and Stormtroopers dying\\, along side some really awesome 1 on 1 fights and some surprises I did not see coming sprinkled in. Overall if you are a fan of Rian's work or just love Star Wars see it in theaters\\, and actually give originality and creativity a chance it might actually shock you.\\n95\/100","true":true}
