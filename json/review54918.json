Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's my second Star Wars film I've ever seen (Episode 4 being the first one)\\, and I must say I loved this film. It's really well made\\, but with its own issues. Humour in the film isn't the best\\, it's not good and I feel I would appreciate the film even more if it had none of it. Storywise\\, it's extremely similar to Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2. I'm not sure if it was just a coincidence\\, but basically every question can be answered by looking at Kung Fu Panda and I'm not kidding\\, It's extremely similar (which isn't necessarily bad\\, I like Kung Fu Panda). The structure of the story is also quite simple. First\\, everything that comes up must be rejected by one of the characters\\, and then the other character will do what he wishes anyways and in conclusion it'll in the interest of them all. This structure repeats itself throughout the film. It's very linear story telling. Overall\\, It was entertaining which is why its 4\/5.","true":true}
