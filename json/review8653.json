Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time reviewing a movie on the site.  SW:TLJ was...alright?  Had some pretty cool parts to it (Ben and Rey's fight was pretty sweet)\\, had some disappointing parts to it (Snoke's death was just...ugh)\\, had some really weird moments to it (Leia's superwoman moment?  Literally face-palmed in the movie).  I'd suggest watching it\\, maybe even watching it twice; just don't be surprised if you come away a bit baffled by it.","true":true}
