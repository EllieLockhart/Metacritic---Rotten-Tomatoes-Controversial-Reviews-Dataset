Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment. I even had to sign up for this site just to vent. \\n\\nThe only redeeming feature is Adam Driver. What a mess Disney and Rian Johnson have left for the next director! What they did to the character of Luke shows incredible disregard for the character and all the prior films. Did Rian watch any of them? It's almost unbelievable\\, but I saw this trainwreck with my own eyes.\\n\\nAs long as we the consumer keep paying for this BS\\, this is what they will serve up. Films with unlikable characters. Films with no continuity or consequence. Films where critics are in fear of giving a truthful review lest they not be given free park hopper tickets to Disneyland. Disney does own 80% of everything now.  RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
