Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its funny to see so many 5 star reviews \\, trying so hard to make up for the negative reviews even though they merit the backlash for being the worst star wars movie ever made.","true":true}
