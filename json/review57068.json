Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a film that didn't have to be made. Simply put this film's plot line could have started and ended in roughly 45 minutes. It dragged for way too long and at the end we didn't get any of the answers we were all asking. Nothing got resolved\\, no wrap up of previous plots\\, no story progression\\, and nothing to kept me wanting to watch the next film. This movie felt like part 2 of 5 and not part 2 of 3. It felt like another Harry Potter film in the mix of the 20 they have.","true":true}
