Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing in this film felt expected. It's true\\, most fan theories never came to fruition--really the entire movie subverted the idea of what it means to win\\, and what it means to be a hero. And that's just one of the many things I loved.","true":true}
