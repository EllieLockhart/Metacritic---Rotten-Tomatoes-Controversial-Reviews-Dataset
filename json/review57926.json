Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of time! That's 2hrs and 20 minutes of my time that I sadly can never get back in my life! I truly don't understand how anyone can say this was a good or great movie? Plot=Crap\\, Characters=Crap\\, Main fight scenes=Crap. I don't want to talk about the movie and ruin it for anyone\\, but if you really enjoyed Force Awakens and plan on going to see this\\, expect to be disappointed! The movie was just all over the place and honestly didn't make much sense. Then there is so many holes in the stories it's not even funny! \\n\\nI just expected so much more because Force Awakens was pretty good. Not great\\, but certainly enjoyable and better then I expected. Well\\, I went in having high expectations and came out surprising in shock and awe. It's to the point where I really have to question if I should even bother seeing the next one. \\n\\nJust seeing the 93% fresh from the critics makes me laugh. I can't take them seriously. I get that everyone is different\\, but I just can't imagine what someone would say was that great about the movie. I truly don't!? Although\\, to be fair there were a few scenes that were ok and had promise\\, but those moments were few and far between. I was lucky enough to get a vendor invite for a special screening\\, so my ticket was free and I even received a gift card for attending\\, but if I actually paid to see this garage I would be furious!","true":true}
