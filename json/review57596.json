Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a tragic disappointment.  No amount of glossy prepaid reviews can change this.  I don't know how all these so called \\\"life long Star Wars fans\\\" could possibly have enjoyed it.  There are a lot of things I could criticize (awful jokes\\, Rey's ability to do everything without any training\\, etc.) but I think the most unforgivable travesty in this\\, is the treatment of Luke Skywalker and Mark Hamill.  \\n\\nFor reasons that probably only Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson know\\, they chose to turn Luke Skywalker into an irrelevant joke.  A bitter\\, angry old useless man who thinks about murdering kids and no longer cares about his family or anyone else.  \\n\\nThis is not true to the character\\, it's not believable\\, it feels addenda driven.  It is a slap in the face to all the fans.  And judging by the end of TFA\\, it's clearly not what JJ intended to happen\\,  Not only did it make for terrible dialog and awkward scenes\\, but it passed up the chance to preserve the specialness of the OT\\, while simultaneously advancing the world of Star Wars for generations to come.  \\n\\nThanks Disney\\, you've made me appreciate the prequels.  At least they had a purpose.","true":true}
