Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Reading some of these negative reviews amazes me.  They're all nonsense. The game was released on the 19th and there are a bunch of reviews slamming the game that day\\, uninformed opinions.\rGameplay is improved\\, the ability for stealth\\, the interaction with the scenes.\rOnce again they've created a beautiful and atmospheric world with some really nice touches and attention to detail.\rThe build up to climax of the intro is amazing\\, really well put together and it did a great job of getting me invested in the rest of plot to want to enact revenge.\rThe rest of the game was great too\\, immersive as expected and some real good scares at certain points. It's definitely scarier in parts than the last one.\rAs for character development the plot and story is very very good at shifting your perspective on how you feel about the characters.  At times forcing you to go against your will and work against what you really want\\, but it pays off and makes you empathise really well with all parties.\rThe ending is great too\\, ties things off nicely\\, but it's also quite melancholy.  There's a real sense of loss that you feel on behalf of the character which given all that they've been through is understandable.  The fact that naughty dog can make you feel that is a credit to their team.\rHighly recommended. I've not read a single convincing negative review here.\rThe only thing I'd have liked\\, would have to been to also play Tommys days in Seattle.\rI'm hoping for some add-ons later down the line with that content and perhaps with journeys to Seattle.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
