Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong lover of the  Star Wars Universe and with the story of the Jedi.  This movie did not honor any of the original films (IV-VI) except in a passing way. This film is simply  pandering to nostalgia and selling plush toys for Disney.  I am not looking forward to episode IX.  You win Lucas\\, Dinsney et al.  You have killed my childhood.","true":true}
