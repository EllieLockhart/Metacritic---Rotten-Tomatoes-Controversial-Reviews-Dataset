Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an incredible experience and a breathtaking next step in the Star Wars journey. Rian Johnson took it in a direction that I wasn't expecting but left me pleasantly surprised. I'm going to have to see it in theaters at least two more times.","true":true}
