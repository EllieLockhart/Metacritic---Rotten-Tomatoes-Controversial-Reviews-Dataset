Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has destroyed the legacy of Star Wars.  How such a movie ever got approval is beyond my understanding.  But what truly bothers me are all those positive reviews.\\n\\nCan it be true that \\\"all the hate is only based on unfulfilled expectations\\\" and \\\"all negative comments come from bots\\\"\\, while all the blunders in the movie are so horribly\\, horribly obvious?  Do all those people praising the film as \\\"the best Star Wars ever\\\" really not see the incoherent story\\, the major plotholes\\, the bad pacing\\, all the things that didn't make sense or were only added to have pointless 'extra' action and 3d\/IMAX-friendly CGI effects?  Do they really believe there was character development when there obviously wasn't any\\, or only at the level of what an eight-year-old would come up with?  Do they really not see all this out-of-place \\\"Feminist Agenda\\\" shoved in your face?  Do they really think it's a suitable sequel\\, even though almost all mysteries brought up in the previous movie were either contradicted or simply discarded out of laziness \/ ignorance?  Do they really see this sloppy and uninspired writing and borrowing ideas from other\/previous movies as 'fresh' and 'original'?  Even if it were not a Star Wars movie\\, but a sequel to ANY other franchise\\, such incompetent \\\"I can't be bothered to address unanswered questions from previous movies \/ I go my own way so I can show how creative I truly am \/ I do a reboot & start from scratch because it's so much more convenient\\\" mentality is unforgivable!  It's not just a badly-made Star Wars movie\\, it's a badly-made movie overall.\\n\\nI'm usually willing to forgive much\\, even totally unexpected twists and turns\\, as long as a movie in general makes sense & is entertaining\\, I do understand that not everyone can be pleased\\, and also that we have a new generation of viewers now.  But I refuse to believe that this new generation does not care about story and characters anymore and is just happy when there are cool CGI visuals and fight scenes...that this new generation of viewers is really THIS simple-minded.  But obviously it seems to be true.\\n\\nAnd do all those 'professional' reviewers that actually work for established media truly not see those faults?  I always thought they would watch a movie from a neutral standpoint and use common sense when reviewing.  But it actually seems more likely that they just read Disney's Press Release where things and meanings are explained to them in advance (like \\\"Luke throwing away his Light Saber is meant as a symbol of going beyond the old Star Wars Universe\\\" and such)\\, and nod approvingly at such profound wisdom and symbolism\\, while being totally blind to all the stuff done wrong\\, let alone forming an opinion on their own.\\n\\nAnd while we are at it\\, why is the RottenTomatoes Audience Score still at 50% approval\\, while when I do a basic count\\, it should be much lower??","true":true}
