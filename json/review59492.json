We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok so I'll start off with the good things it's beautiful \\, a very clean looking game\\, little games with the guitar and the snowball fights were fun\\, but I thk the best thing about this game was the flashbacks and if could guess why it's bc Joel and Ellie were together they had the bond with each other that's what I thk is the best part of it all. Now 2 the bad things Joel's death and I would have been ok with him dying but not like that they could have made a build up let u play as Ellie and Abby through the game without Joel dying but then at the end Abby kills Joel and then u hate Abby even after playing as her but u still had time with Joel before he died  . But they kill joel like 2 hrs in and they make u play as Abby 4 10-12 hrs\\, yeah great move on them. They don't give anything new except 4 going prone. Everything bad happens 2 Ellie but Abby has everything compared 2 Ellie. Abby even gets better guns. And they try 2 make u sympathize 4 her and make u like her when her and her whole crew are boring af. Ellie lost everything by the end and u don't even get a choice 2 kill Abby. They put an unnecessary sex scene\\, and they r somehow aloud 2 put **** on the game when no other game can have a butt cheek out. The game is poorly paced  and is so repetitive and boring. If I remember correctly I thk only 1 chick died and it was the pregnant 1\\, and she goes on missions with u with a baby\\, she's climbing things with a baby how dumb is that. Their is nothing 2 keep u motivated besides killing Abby in the end but u don't get 2 so yeah. The whole reason why You 1 was so good was bc of  Why couldn't they at least gave us a choice\\, but now their gonna milk the series and im not getting the last of us or 3. This games story is predictable\\, poorly written and not believable in the slightest. U can hate me all u want but I don't give **** what u thk it's my opinion and 80% of everyone elses.
