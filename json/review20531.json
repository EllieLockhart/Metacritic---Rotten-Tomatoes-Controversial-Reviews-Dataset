Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've given more time and effort to typing reviews and criticisms of this hack job of a film that to retype all of it here when the movie is already at a 48% feels like bullying. It deserves it\\, but I'm refusing to do it. If you're a Star Wars fan\\, you know everything and anything that I could say about this piece of shit. If you aren't\\, don't bother at this point.","true":true}
