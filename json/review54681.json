Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really didn't like this film. Saw it in theaters twice\\, and I came out of it the first time mixed. When I saw it a second time\\, I really didn't like it. The jokes were off and out of universe at time\\, ie YO MAMA Jokes. I just didn't like what Rian Johnson did with Luke. I don't mind the diversity of this film or the sequel trilogy as a whole\\, but its really hard to look the other way when Benicio del Toro gets as much screen time as\\, if not more than\\, Mark Hamill and R2-D2 is just an after thought. The direction of Kylo didn't convey to me any serious direction taken in the character. Rey and Luke really training together is a Crime. We could have seen some real philosophical aspects of the force\\, but Canto Bight had to absorb much of the film's run time for that. Not putting Finn and Poe in more scenes together was a crime. By the time Luke and Kylo face off\\, I was drained. The movie tries to fill in 2 movies worth of information with out the discovery. Luke dying was just the worst. It didn't even feel like it was worth the sacrifice. I will not watch any SW films in the future with Johnson at the directors chair. I have hope in JJ\\, and it's a real travesty that Solo: A Star Wars Story (which was a really fun and exciting movie) will probably never get a sequel because of the unnecessary risks taken in this film. Keep Johnson the hell away from The Mandalorian.","true":true}
