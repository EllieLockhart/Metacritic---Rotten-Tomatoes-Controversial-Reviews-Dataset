Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is ok and that's bad. Plot holes everywhere. underwhelming new characters\\, some scenes are boring and unnecessary (yeah\\, I'm looking at you casino scene) and they waste a lot of good characters. For me this was a disappointment. You'll laugh from time to time and you'll enjoy the music and cinematography (this is a very gorgeous movie) but that's it. The story is far from interesting and it has some poor writing. Don't expect much.","true":true}
