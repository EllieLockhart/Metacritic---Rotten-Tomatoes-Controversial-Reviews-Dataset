Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's so many things wrong with this movie\\, i don't even know where to start. The storyline is a mess.... They act like the entire episode 7 didn't exist. Horrible character development\\, I cared not one bit about anyone really in the entire movie. I'm so sorry i'm about to say this (since i'm a star wars fan since birth) but Star Wars is officially over for me and I am sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.","true":true}
