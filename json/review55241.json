Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw The Last Jedi and have to say while an entertaining film it left me feeling very underwhelmed. SPOILERS ALERT: \\n\\nWaited 30 Years for Luke Skywalker to come back and they make him out to be hopeless\/uninteresting\/broken for the entire movie and try to pass of his end as redeeming. Snoke is a nothing character with a nothing backstory and could've been so much more. Rey was interesting in TFW but turns out she is a nobody\\, which would be fine\\, if they hadn't spent all of the Force Awakens making it out to be she was someone with a pivotal backstory. And's what with all the cringy humour at key\\, emotional parts. And don't get me started on the leia flying space scene. \\nI did enjoy the different planets\/locations and the new aliens introduced was pretty cool. Exploring the history and the understanding of the Force was very engaging so more of that is needed. It the most interesting element of Star Wars for me \\nFinally the only reason I am looking forward to Episode 9 is seeing Kylo Ren (who I think is the strongest character of the new ones given his emotional range\/complete turn to the dark side - I hope they don't ruin him by making him potentially go back to the light) destroy the resistance and any hope we have left for the future of Stars Wars","true":true}
