Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This one actually had a storyline and if possible in a space opera - a believable ending. OK so the only other from the series I liked was Empire\\, this one was indeed very close - and from a story board perspective better","true":true}
