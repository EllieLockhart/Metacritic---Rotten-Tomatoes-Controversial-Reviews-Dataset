Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie\\, with interesting reflections and action\\,the last jedi take very interesting and risk decisions and maybe not every one of those payoff\\, but a lot of them does. I will say that if you go with an open mind\\, and taking out one specific history line\\, this movie is near perfect.","true":true}
