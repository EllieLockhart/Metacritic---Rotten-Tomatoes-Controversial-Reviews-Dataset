You have to make decisionsI'm a noob gamer and hadn't heard of this title but bought it on a whim when it was on a special offer on PSN\\, and it turned out to be a real breath of fresh air and very welcome change of pace from the huge open world RPG's I've been playing. It is an unfolding story that you move your character through\\, like watching a film that you're taking an active part in. You have to make decisions as you go\\, often having to make choices very quickly and under pressure. It's really well done\\, it looks gorgeous\\, and although it took me a few minutes to get the hang of moving my character almost out of sight until the camera angle changed\\, I did\\, and it all works pretty seamlessly. The acting and characterization is excellent\\, I found it very atmospheric\\, and I was completely engrossed and intrigued to see where the story was heading. I didn't find it terrifying\\, more moderately creepy with some real 'scream out loud' moments that made me laugh afterwards. It wasn't very long but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and will definitely be playing it through again to try some different choices. Worth every penny I spent on it and then some.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
