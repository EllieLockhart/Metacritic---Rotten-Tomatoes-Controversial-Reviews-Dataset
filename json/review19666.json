Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a god action movie\\, but a bad Star Wars movie. If you look at the Star Wars franchise\\, no Star Wars movie has had as much comedy and just randomness. The porgs (though cute) felt out of all place\\, the \u2018fantastic\u2019 city of gambling was so amazing as it was like Las Vegas. I enjoyed it as a normal movie but I didn\u2019t like it as a Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
