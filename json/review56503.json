Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force is a balance between the light and the dark\\, and the light eventually wins. What a perfect metaphor for The Last Jedi\\, a balance between great scenes and stupid shit\\, which won my affection in the end.\\nI'm late to this party\\, so you already know the stupid shit. The side quest within a side quest to the casino planet was annoying and pointless. There wasn't any way to get Rose and Finn aboard Snoke's ship other than that overlong and idiotic excursion? It had George Lucas episode 1 written all over it. Speaking of Rose\\, what was the point of her? I found her irritating and a distraction for Finn\\, who already has two love interests. How did Rose and Finn become such good speeder pilots so quickly? And why didn't the Vice-Admiral decide to turn the cruiser around and jump a bit sooner\\, before there were only about 5 transports left? Finally\\, what happened to the rest of the Resistance ground fighters at the end? I don't think they all made it into the Falcon.\\nAll of that vexation aside (and it's a lot\\, and there's more)\\, the overall story arc was quite good\\, Rey and Luke together were amusing and strong\\, and Kylo Ren becoming the new Supreme Leader was the biggest and most welcome change from the original trilogy. They heard fans appreciate the humor from episode VII\\, so more was added here\\, pushing some moments as far as continuity would allow\\, particularly with Luke.\\nI want to learn how to force-project myself\\, a new but logical conception here\\, because you can make yourself look younger and with a better haircut. I don't have any idea what will happen in episode IX\\, which is a welcome feeling after too much repetition in this series.","true":true}
