Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The whole plot doesn't make any sense.  \\nin last movie\\, the resistance destroyed the star killer base\\, that has no effect on the universe.  \\nThe start of the movie\\, First Order caught resistance mid-evacuate with only hand-full of ships.  The logic move is to destroy the ships and stop the retreat.  if they did that\\, movie would be over.  Instead they not only let resistance get away\\, by literately showing how incompetent General Hux is\\, . \\n30 seconds later\\, the movie turns into a slow-paced space chase.  To prevent people get bored of that\\, a few characters went for an unnecessary side quest.  \\nThe only thing interesting in this movie is Luke\\, Rey and Kylo\\, while the empty Snook served as backdrop.","true":true}
