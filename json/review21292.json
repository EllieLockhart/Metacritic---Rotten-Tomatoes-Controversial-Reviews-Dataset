Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this really wanting to like it. But with the horrible\\, off kilter\\, ill timed jokes\\, dialogue that is bad at best and vague or incomprehesible at worst\\, story arcs that seem to have no greater purpose for enriching the plot overall\\, and just a lot of action with no meaning\\, I can safely say this is the worst Star Wars movie I've seen. And since the previous movie was so great and had so much potential\\, this movie tanking is a major let down. Its all flash and no substance or intelligence. The only thing I enjoyed was the chase out of the casino and the struggle between Rey and Ben\\, as well as seeing Leia one last time.","true":true}
