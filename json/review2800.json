Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie\\,  I watched it in a plane monitor because I knew it was bad enough and movie tickets arent cheap were I live.\\nI laughed and facepalm and was ultimately bored of the movie\\, it didnt have any sort of consistency nor planning... never thought I would find a Star Wars movie just boring... \\nThe director knew nothing about star wars and the movie itself was disrespectful to one of the most beloved characters in the franchise\\, even Mark hamil himself had to swallow his own opinions because the director didnt want to listen to anyone but himself.","true":true}
