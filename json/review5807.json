Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed in the storytelling here. While the claim is the movie is a message about failure as a teacher... there don't seem to be many lessons learned\\, or that the ones that are learned contradict one another. The many plot threads that were left hanging felt very unsatisfying\\, with certain characters unceremoniously removed that will leave more questions than answers. Unfortunately many of the situations that characters get themselves into are resolved in such a way that doesn't drive the narrative further much\\, leaving the direction for episode 9 in question\\, much like a rope that has frayed in too many directions to repair. It does not help either that many moments of tension are deliberately ended early by awkwardly timed jokes that seem to ensure the audience does not ever feel the full weight of certain events. The film was\\, however\\, beautifully shot\\, and was a spectacle to watch. It's unfortunate that the decent acting portrayed was undermined by what to this viewer seemed to be nonsensical framing devices\\, padded storytelling\\, tonal inconsistencies\\, narrative dead ends\\, and unfulfilled setups.","true":true}
