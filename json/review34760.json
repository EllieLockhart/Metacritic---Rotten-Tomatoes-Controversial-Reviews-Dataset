Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The dialog was abysmal and the Star Wars Galaxy lore\/how-everything-works seems to have been thrown to the wayside. As a long time Star Wars fan\\, I felt that this movie was a commercialization sell out on behalf of Disney. I was left cringing multiple times at the dialog and ludicrous action scenes. My personal opinion is that this rivals The Phantom Menace as possibly the worst addition to the series.","true":true}
