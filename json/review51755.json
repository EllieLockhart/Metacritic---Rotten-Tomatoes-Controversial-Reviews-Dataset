Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disinterested little spicy boner of a film. It's clear Disney's priorities were in marketing and merchandising instead of actually telling a compelling story--forced\\, tone-breaking humor; mary sue Rei amped up to 11; and Luke vigorously sucking alien tits for survival (seriously)\\, take precedence of\\, you know\\, telling us where Snoke came from\\, why Rei is so overpowered\\, Leia flying like superman NOT being a laughably stupid idea...\\nNot cool Disney. Mark Hamill tried to warn us\\, and you silenced him.","true":true}
