Before playing Last of Us 2 I played Last of Us. The gameplay is very very similar\\, and most of the modification to the gameplay seems to have come from the Uncharted series.

The graphics are a bit better than Uncharted 4\/Lost Legacy I think\\, but I still think recent Uncharted were better looking than the Last of Us 2\\, because well\\, they showed exotic locations instead of a deplorable situation that the world finds themselves in the Last Of Us universe. When you play as a character in car (when the Scars chase you) also seems to be straight out of Uncharted series. Similarly characters swimming to the Aquarium in a storm seems to be out Uncharted 4 (when Drake swims to the island). So overall the gameplay is nothing new\\, but combined from multiple games. The gameplay it is still very solid if you isolate the game and treat it as an independent unit. The only addition I liked to the gameplay was the ability to play the guitar in the game. The sound\\, music\\, the whole atmosphere is really great. So I would really like to commend the efforts of the developers at Naughty Dog for their tremendous efforts.\r\rThe storyline was really a let down in this game. I think this stems from the higher positioned personnel in the company.  I am reading positive reviews where people complain that some negative reviews didn't not like the characters because of their sexuality etc. I think that is definitely not the case for majority of the people. I really liked Lost Legacy with two central female characters\\, and I loved the Last of Us DLC. The character development in TLOU2 is rather poor for the new characters\\, and the old characters seems to be stagnated. I really do think\\, that playing as Ellie throughout the game would have been much better\\, and having a DLC for Abby would have made much more sense. But anyways these poor decisions should be aimed at people at higher positions (who make these kind of decisions\\, such as directors\\, writers) rather than personnel who make the vision and decision for the game come to fruition (such as the software developers\\, the voice actors\\, the music directors etc. They really did a fantastic job with an average recipe\\, namely the story\\, they had at hand).\r\rNaughty Dog thrive on the story of the game and the way it is told. This was a really poor attempt at story telling\\, absolutely shambles. The overall rating of the game for me would thus be 3.\r\rThe efforts of the general cast of the game (the developers\\, the voice actors\\, the sound and music composers etc.) - 10\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
