Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ killed Star Wars. Incredibly\\, astonishingly\\, bad story-telling. Rian Johnson and anyone else who had a role in writing this trash are\\, very simply\\, stupid btihches.
