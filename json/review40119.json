Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars movie\\, this is political warfare in the worst way possible. Hamill says \\\"you have to think of the fans\\\"\\, Johnson says \\\"no\\, I have to think of the movie I want to create\\\". Horrible.","true":true}
