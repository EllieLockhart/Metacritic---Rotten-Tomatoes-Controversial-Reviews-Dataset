The moment Joel gets killed off by Abby that right there was enough for me to hate this character and nothing they could do was ever going to change my mind on her and playing as the character for 10 hours after that happened in a desperate bid to make people care for this character did not work on me at all there was nothing redeemable about this character or her friends that all ended getting killed which they deserved because of what they did in the first place and the ending left a sour taste in my mouth\\, they could have at least given the players the choice to decide if they should let Abby live or die but we never got that which in the end left Ellie with nothing at the end of it all.\r\rSo this is by no means a 10 out of 10 game the gameplay and graphics was the only good things about this sequel but the story to me was a huge letdown.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
