Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is entertaining at times and the growth of the Star Wars Universe is exciting for any life-long Star Wars fan. However\\, the forced (no pun intended) comic relief was an unfortunate capitulation to the current movie trends on the part of Disney\/Johnson. Comic relief can be good\\, but I cannot believe how poorly it was used in this movie (see original Trilogy for how it can work effectively). \\n\\nThis movie felt like Disney\/Johnson have never seen a previous Star Wars film. They are certainly not bound by the past (and they shouldn't be) and I looked forward to where they would innovate and take the Star Wars Universe. However\\, they ought to be bound by who a character fundamentally is. At the very least\\, significant work must be done from a character development perspective to fill the void left by a fundamental change. I'm talking about Luke's character here most especially. He is portrayed as someone wholly different. There was zero character development and the limited effort thay was made for a back story wasn't terribly believable. Critics may appreciate that it is real and raw to portray him as a flawed character\\, but that is something different from changing what makes him Luke Skywalker. It's really unfortunate and harms the larger Arc of the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
