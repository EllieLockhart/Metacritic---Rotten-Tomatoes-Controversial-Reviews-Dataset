Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead\\, be forewarned: I enjoyed  this movie greatly\\, and strangely for a reason some many of the negative reviews highlight--the treatment of Luke. Luke has always been a conflicted character walking the path between light and dark. To me it makes complete sense that he would tire of this battle\\, and being the last Jedi\\, simply turn his back on the Jedi (and Force) in frustration. To see him wrestle with this decision and then ultimately be redeemed\\, to me\\, makes this one of the better movies. I really get a sense of who Luke\\, as a real person\\, actually is\\, and what he struggles with. As for the rest of the movie\\, I like Rey as a Jedi\\, and it's a relief to find a character who is aggressively committed to the light side. She is not conflicted\\, which is refreshing in a series filled with flawed heroes. Similarly\\, though she's a side character\\, I also like Rose as well. The only draw backs for me are that the movie tries to do a lot in a short time (Ren's move toward being a Jedi; the rescue of the rebel fleet; the redemption of Luke); and the obvious lack of resolution as we lead to a third movie in the series.","true":true}
