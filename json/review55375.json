Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Was a fantastic addition to the current canon and did a wonderful job telling the story. I think what a lot of people don't understand is that this movie is about letting go of the past\\, and that is something a ton of people are having a hard time doing. This movie told the story of the force and what that means for the people who use it and live with it. It shows hope\\, and how the balance continues on in every aspect of the universe. The movie has a lot of beautiful locations per Star Wars tradition\\, and some very riveting action sequences. I have a few complaints but overall I really enjoyed it and feel it deserves high praise. More than once I was sitting on the edge of my seat or having a fist pumping moment.","true":true}
