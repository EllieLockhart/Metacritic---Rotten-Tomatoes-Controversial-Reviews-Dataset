Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater feeling like I had just been de-pantsed.  I've vowed to see it again\\, just to reinforce my initial feelings of disappointment.  The villains in this trilogy remind me of the guys from the Alpha Beta house in Revenge of the Nerd.  I'm hanging onto some hope that\\, by the grace of God\\, JJ Abrams can work some Jedi magic of his own on episode IX.  I liked The Force Awakens...despite some of its own flaws.  At least there was some mystery surrounding the Snoke character.  Rion Johnson put a swift end to that\\, as well as Captain Phasma.  At this point in time\\, I'd be more excited to see Dennis Rodman replace Kylo Ren as the main antagonist.  It's such a terrible character.  Somehow\\, Rey is pretty much already the most kickass Jedi in the galaxy.  Princess Leia can now fly and survive in space\\, though she's never done anything bad ass in any of the prequels.  The irreverence shown to the character of Luke Skywalker is baffling\\, and is on par with Captain Kirk's portrayal in Star Trek Generations.  I would've preferred Disney opening The Force Awakens with space tombstones for Han Solo\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and Princess Leia.  I'm confused by so much...including the 93% critic ratings on here.  Wtf.  If you're a long-time Star Wars fan\\, be prepared to be frustrated and unfulfilled with this shit show.","true":true}
