Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a casual fan of Star Wars in it for the basic fun I was very disappointed at the writing of this movie. It has its moments but overall the story is at times repetitive. Beautifully shot and directed\\, the writing well not as good. My least favorite of all the Star Wars movies (yes\\, incluythe peequels).","true":true}
