Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the biggest disgrace to to the Star Wars universe ever. The way they handled the original characters is outstandingly bad  isn't even the same person. There are to many plot holes to count\\, the story telling is worse then the Star Wars holiday special and rose was in love with Finn because he was a hero but she then stopped him from saving everyone because she's a useless character. Rey is confirmed to be a Mary Sue because she has no important lineage so that can't do anything to enhance her ability to do anything perfectly\\, and Luke would have died better if he just went to the plant instead of making a astral image because he would have died either way","true":true}
