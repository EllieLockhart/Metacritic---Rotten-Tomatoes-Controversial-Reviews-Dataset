Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi follows in the footsteps of The Force Awakens in revitalizing the Star Wars franchise after the abysmal prequels. It\u2019s a genuinely fun ride but long\\, with emotional twists\\, that could be improved with sharper editing.","true":true}
