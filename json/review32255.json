Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars episode VIII: The Last Jedi was the most disappointing thing since my son. \\n\\nNo amount of Disney money is gonna sweep this turd under the rug.\\n\\nEven the strongest internet\/social media propaganda shall fail to put lipstick on this pig \\n\\nAnyone who thought this movie was really Star Wars is an idiot\\, delusional or a sellout.\\n \\nAnd that's most of the people out there \\n\\nGood Luck watching IX everybody","true":true}
