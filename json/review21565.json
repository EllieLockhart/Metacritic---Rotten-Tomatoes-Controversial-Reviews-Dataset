Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Jesus Christ... what a mess.\\nI don't even like the Star Wars saga\\, or the films\\, but I am a sci-fi lover so I had to go see it. Already thought that the last film was a let down\\, BUT THIS?!\\n\\nBoy oh boy...the plot is such a mess\\, plot holes all over\\, weird and plain stupid things are happening on the silver screen. See\\, this is a fantasy\/sci-fi film\\, to talk about logic is almost a little comical anyway\\, BUT the characters motivations\\, decisions etc. just don't make sense.\\n\\nSave yourself the cash seeing this in theater\\, wait for it to show up for free on Netlfix sometime. MAN\\, I don't even like the 70's\\, 80's or whatever orginals\\, but they are by FAAAAR better than this. Stick to those 3 and completely forget about what Disney came up with since 2015.","true":true}
