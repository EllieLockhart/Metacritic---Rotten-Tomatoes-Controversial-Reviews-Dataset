Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came away from this film not knowing what I'd seen. It certainly wasn't a Star Wars film. I don't want to spoil anything so all I'll say is if you wanted answers for any of the questions raised in the force awakens you won't get any. Be prepared to feel like your on earth constantly. Don't get attached to any of the many subplots. And prepare to dislike every character you learnt to love. Also I didn't realise it was meant to be a second rate comedy.  2 positives 1) badass leia 2) porgs","true":true}
