{"101487":175200,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-21","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a jumbled mess of excellent story telling and tragically bad story telling all blended together into a middling\\, sloppy\\, almost great whole. First thing's first: Mark Hamill steals the show. Luke Skywalker is borderline-perfect in this film\\, and I personally feel that people who think Luke should never have turned out cynical and old need to reexamine the way they look at their stories. Characters change. This is a reasonable change. In fact\\, the entire Luke\/Rey\/Kylo third of this story is top notch. The problems start to arise with the other major pieces of the story: the Holdo\/Poe storyline and the Rose\/Finn storyline. Enough has been said already about the pacing issues of the casino planet in every review I've ever seen\\, but there are bigger problems at play here. There is a difference between the theme of failure and the theme of pointlessness. Finn and Rose's adventure is pointless. It is a string of barely acceptable coincidences in which they get thrown in prison\\, hire a random hacker despite having been told only one man can do the job (the random guy they found works just fine)\\, sneak aboard the enemy ship\\, get captured by the enemy\\, miraculously survive the explosion of a huge chunk of the ship caused by Holdo's sacrifice\\, and somehow escape to reconvene with their friends on Crait. Along the way\\, they free some imprisoned animals in a cheesy scene straight out of Free Willie and maybe somehow fall in love? (I think the movie wants them to have a better relationship than what shows up on screen). Kelly Marie Tran does the best with the role given to her\\, but her character isn't quite interesting enough to really pull you in. The Holdo\/Poe storyline is the bigger problem\\, with Holdo's decision not to tell any of her troops her relatively good plan (even after they stage a coup) coming across as a bit nonsensical (especially rewatching the movie)\\, but not presented as a character flaw or poor decision on her part. This all culminates in an act of self-sacrifice on her part which breaks the known laws of space combat and leaves the audience wondering\\, \\\"Why isn't all of space combat peopling strapping warp drives to rocks and flinging them at big ships?????\\\" The movie's climax is redemptive\\, with the final battle between Luke and Kylo working quite well\\, and the scene involving Rose and Finn working relatively well. The earlier fight scene featuring Rey and Kylo along with Snoke and his guards is quite fun\\, and the big reveal regarding Rey's parents is wonderfully executed. Unfortunately\\, it's not just plot holes and poor pacing that drag this movie down. You also have inconsistent themes. Is this a movie about blindly trusting authority? (Poe should have trusted Holdo\\, despite having little reason to do so)\\, but this is literally a series about rebelling against an authoritarian\\, fascist government\\, so blindly following orders feels like an odd theme. Is this is a movie about saving your friends instead of making noble sacrifices? (Rose saves Finn and claims that this is how they win the war\\, and Holdo's plan seems to boil down to saving as many people as possible and running rather than fighting)\\, yet some of the biggest moments in this movie are selfless sacrifices: Holdo flies into an enemy ship (why don't they have autopilot????) and Luke dies after exerting all his energy to save the day. And Captain Phasma is just as disappointing in this movie as the last one (I was hoping they'd have learned from the disappointment of Boba Fett). My last talking point is Rey and a thematic issue I have with her character development. I don't feel like she really has flaws. Luke wasn't the most dynamic character in the original series. He didn't have a ton of flaws either. But that doesn't mean we can't hope for better. If you compare a crucial scene from Last Jedi with one in Empire\\, you can see a storytelling problem. In Empire\\, Luke decides to abandon his training with Yoda due to his attachment to his friends. This decision leads to ruin and a lost arm. He eventually must learn to overcome his connections to loved ones. Flipping over to TLJ\\, Rey's only flaw seems to be her obsession with finding or at least identifying her parents. Sure\\, she has delusions about who her parents are and who she is\\, but what does this character flaw amount to? What is the cost of this flaw? She leaves the island\\, confronts Kylo Ren\\, breaks her lightsaber\\, and saves her friends\\, even inspiring Luke to get involved along the way. But even the breaking of Luke's old saber isn't really presented as a major loss. One last thing: This movie is about letting go of the past\\, but remembering it. Forgive\\, but don't forget. It's a good theme for Star Wars. Luke learns that the legacy of the Jedi is a legacy of failure and problematic beliefs. So why renege on that? In the final confrontation with Kylo\\, why not say that the Jedi ARE dead\\, but anybody has the capacity to use the force for good. That Rey is her own person and has the capacity for goodness and greatness\\, separate from the problematic history of the Jedi? It's not a big deal\\, but it feels like a missed opportunity. And of course I have to talk about the soundtrack. Williams's scores may be a staple of the series\\, but this soundtrack is lazy and uninspired. There's one new original song (the Casino Planet) and one new motif (Rose's Theme) and that's it. The rest of the movie is uninspired remixes. All the performances in this movie are good to great\\, and I really like Rey as the series protagonist in particular: this movie just needed a cleaner script and a little more character work to really tie it together (and maybe a mega fan or two with working knowledge of Star Wars lore and mechanics).","true":true}
