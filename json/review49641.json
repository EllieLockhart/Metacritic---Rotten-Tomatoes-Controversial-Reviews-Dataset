Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow! This movie was awful. There were so many examples of bad storytelling. There were plot holes and useless subplots that killed the pace of the movie. There were main characters that were underdeveloped or badly written. There was parody humor in what was supposed to be a serious Star Wars film. The execution of character development was bad. This is the first movie I\u0092ve ever watched where there\u0092s gravity in outer space and that humans are able to breath oxygen also. I have no interest in watching any future Star Wars films.","true":true}
