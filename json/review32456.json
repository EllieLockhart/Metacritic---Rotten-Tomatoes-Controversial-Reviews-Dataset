Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u201cStar Wars 'Last Jedi' Toy Shipments Down Sharply From 'Force Awakens\u2019\u201d Why would that be if this movie is SO AMAZING \u201cprofessional critics\u201d ehhhh \u201cmanipulated yellow journalists\u201d? Because...It\u2019s awful. This movie is a bad movie period. It\u2019s so bad that it can\u2019t even strive to be a bad Star Wars movie. Do you know when this happened before (slumped toy sales)?
