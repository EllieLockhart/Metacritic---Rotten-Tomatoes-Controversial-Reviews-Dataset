Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was not a fan of TFA but at least it did not completely ruin Star Wars. TLJ however was atrocious. The character arcs for Luke & Leia were both awful. When I thought they would actually do something daring and brave in killing Finn\\, it did not happen. Both Mark Hamill and George Lucas have both expressed their dislike for Disney and SW but had to walk back their opinions. It is a very sad time to be an OT SW fan. The future adventures we once dreamed of for the characters we loved are dead. No wise Jedi sage in Luke and NO adventures where Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia were even together in one place. Think about that. The main three (and 3PO\\, R2\\, and Chewbacca) were never even on screen together to share a scene!  This one is a stinker. Search your feelings\\, you know it to be true. #notmystarwars","true":true}
