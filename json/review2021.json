Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who has been watching Star Wars since he was six\\, I'm twenty now\\, and some one to whom Star Wars isnt just a movie series but a passion unlike any other. I can happily say that I love The Last Jedi. It is truly and honestly my favorite movie of the Saga now.","true":true}
