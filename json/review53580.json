Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic addition to the Star Wars Saga\\, really enjoyed this... visually stunning in places\\, shocking twists and great new ideas... better than TFA\\, can\u2019t wait for Episode IX... I\u2019ll have to make do with a few more visits to re-watch! ***** Spoilers ***** I\u2019ve read some reviews from \u201cBig Fans\u201d and am shocked and saddened that they don\u2019t like this film and are even picking plot holes where there aren\u2019t any... here are my thoughts 1) \u201cWhere are the Knights of Ren\u201d? - well\\, you know the guys in red in the throne room?... 2) \u201cIt is too long\u201d - No\\, it\u2019s not long enough and there are sequences that could have been longer... filmmakers have to sacrifice things for the overall story and the director clearly wants to keep he audience guessing 3) \u201cWorst movie of the lot\u201d - you really need to have an open mind people... they aren\u2019t going to just re-hash the old stuff again (like TFA)\\, this introduces new story lines and locations which is a good things\\, not bad 4) \u201cToo much CGI\/Jar-Jar comparisons\/Just there for toys\u201d - what because there weren\u2019t characters in the original trilogy just for toy sales?? The Porgs are used sparingly and lighten the tone 5) \u201cToo much comedy\u201d - it\u2019s nice to see\\, in my opinion\\, it\u2019s not the Dark Knight trilogy!! Star Wars has a tradition of comedy in it and it\u2019s just the modern take on it with a modern film 6) \u201cUnrealistic\u201d - OMG! It\u2019s a \u201cfantasy\u201d sci-fi film... get a dictionary and look up \u201cfantasy\u201d 7) \u201cHux is portrayed as an idiot\/the First Order look stupid\u201d - this is a common and very misguided comment... Hux and Kylo both crave power and have a superiority complex.. they are naive and lose their leader and don\u2019t get on (as per TFA)... I think their portrayal was spit on 8) \u201cNo character development\u201d - there was plenty and Rey and Kylo come out most developed and more likeable than TFA (they needed to as I thought they were disappointing previously) 9) \u201cLeia does a Superman\u201d - she is force sensitive and just because you haven\u2019t seen it in previous films doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible in a \u201cfantasy\u201d movie (see above) 10) GO AND WATCH IT AGAIN!! - I watched at midnight for TFA (and TLJ) and the second and third viewings cement the films more in your mind and make them more enjoyable (and the forth and fifth time)\\, that\u2019s what makes the original trilogy so iconic... they\u2019ve been watched so many times!! Just my opinion but \u201cbig fans\u201d who claim they aren\u2019t going to watch episode IX aren\u2019t \u201cbig fans\u201d they are stuck in the past and need to embrace the fantastic job Disney are doing to give the franchise a new lease of life!","true":true}
