Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film does not deserves the hate that it's getting. I am a huge Star Wars fan and tbh the only thing I hate about Star Wars is that the fans are just assholes that think that the oringals are perfect. The film is amazing and has some great twists but people don't appreciate them\\, can't please everyone I guess. Thank you Rian Johnson for this masterpiece x","true":true}
