Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it! The more I watch it\\, the more I notice\\, and the deeper levels of meaning I find in it. The fact that this movie has multiple psychological layers and its use of Joseph Campbell's monomyths show that the director new exactly what he was doing. Those who were expecting a shallow \\\"guy movie\\\" will be the first to complain about it and express their hatred for the director. Out of all the Star Wars movies that exist\\, this is the one I keep rewatching.","true":true}
