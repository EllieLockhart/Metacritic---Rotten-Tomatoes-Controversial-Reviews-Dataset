Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a visually stunning and competently crafted blockbuster extravaganza that sports some laughs --albeit at times odd and boarder line bizarre -- delivers a slew of striking visuals\\, throws a few plot curveballs\\, and boasts a handful of strong performances (most notably Mark Hamill and Adam Driver). However\\, it seems to deliberately rebuff the foundation that The Force Awakens built\\, as well as undermine at times the general legacy of Star Wars thanks to its fast and loose use of the established mythos\\, and a tonal shift towards nominalist ideas. This along with the story's one-to-many resolutions\\, lack of a meaningful central hero who has need (or room) for growth\\, and seemingly retroactive reset of the geo-galactic conflict to that of the original film\\, puts the franchise's future on shaky ground to being in the end a consistent and meaningful archplot where good triumphs over evil in the classical sense. While overall an entertaining ride\\, The Last Jedi leaves me with a sense of apathy for what comes next in the saga.","true":true}
