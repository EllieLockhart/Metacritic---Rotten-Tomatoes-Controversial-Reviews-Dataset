Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We have to do this before they do that! Over and over again. Some thing were cool. Light speed through a fleet and the likes\\, but over all Luke was weak. Royal guard fight seemed pointless. Finn and Phasma was not needed. I give ait a C","true":true}
