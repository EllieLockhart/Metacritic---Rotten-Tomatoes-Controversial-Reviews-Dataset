Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent addition to the Star Wars timeline.  Rather than the same old formula\\, we get twists\\, turns\\, unexpected surprises\\, major deaths earlier than would have been standard\\, etc.  Great action sequences\\, great development of Kylo and Ren as characters.  Sets us up for a time jump to Episode 9 where I assume real life deaths will have been addressed and the Resistance has built itself back up for a final confrontation.  I had no issues of the handling of Luke\\, and I thought the inclusion of Yoda was perfect.  Glad to see ESB puppet Yoda vs creepy Prequel CGI Yoda.","true":true}
