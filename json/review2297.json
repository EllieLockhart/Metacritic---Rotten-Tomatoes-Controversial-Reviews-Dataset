Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A travesty.  Worst movie I've ever seen.  Other's have said it\\, just read some of the reviews on here that spent some time writing it out.  You'll notice almost none of the positive review give any explanation or substance to their viewpoint.\\n\\nThey destroyed the spirit of the movies.  As for the eventual result of the plot\\, that would have been fine\\, if they had done it in a way that honored the characters\\, rather than crapping on them.\\n\\nAnd the plot was a screaming mess.","true":true}
