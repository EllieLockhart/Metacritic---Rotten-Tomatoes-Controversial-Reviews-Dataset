Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly disappointed in the storey\\, Rian Johnson was given what I would say the best possible movie in the franchise\\, he could have given the characters to the Star Wars saga the well deserved recognition\\, and legendary send off we all wanted to see\\, WTF?\\nButchered\\, it was so out of tune with the actual Star Wars theme\\, it makes the phantom menace a success\\,..\\nMark Hamil should have been able to have a say in the storey writing as I believe he understands the closure that the fans wanted for the legends of Star Wars.","true":true}
