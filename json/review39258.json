Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has a lot of ups and downs. Some humor that doesn\u2019t quite fit in the Star Wars universe. Some happenings that felt unearned. But overall\\, I couldn\u2019t guess what would happen next. And that In and of itself was magical. A unique Star Wars film. A controversial Star Wars film. But i applaud risk taking. ","true":true}
