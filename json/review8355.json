Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like a rehash of many tropes from the original Star Wars trilogy\\, and yet all the plot lines went nowhere and didn't advance the storyline at all. Movie was mostly a lot of talk and filler with very little action for a SW movie. A waste of screen time.","true":true}
