Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore all of the ridiculous 1\/2 and 1 star reviews from the angry\\, shouting\\, so called \\\"hardcore fans\\\"  Nothing that happens in these new movies will ever please them so their opinions really don't matter to the vast majority who absolutely LOVED this movie! \\nIt had everything I want from Star Wars\\, likeable characters\\, great locations\\, fantastic action scenes\\, plenty of questions answered whilst creating just as many other mysteries to ponder and a lot of throwbacks and nods to fans of the original series including a very nice touch in an emotional late scene. \\nThe film is also beautifully shot\\, one of the final scenes involving red soil being ripped up by small ships in a formation was just amazing to watch. \\nIgnore the basement dwellers hating this\\, they'll never be happy with a new vision\/direction for Star Wars so they'll continue to piss and moan whilst masturbating to their old Princess Leia action figures.\\n\\nGo see this movie and enjoy!","true":true}
