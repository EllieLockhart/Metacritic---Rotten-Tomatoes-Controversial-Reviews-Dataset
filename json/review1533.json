Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of Star Wars\\, who has always been able to ignore bad acting or weak plot for the sake of the overall story\\, I couldn't suspend my disbelief while watching this film. It felt like right as I'd be about to settle in and start enjoying it there would be a scene or some dialog that completely shook me out of my disbelief again. The icing on the cake was the movie saying Hyperdrive Ramming was good (despite it rendering pretty much every single other movie obsolete by simply existing) but an incredibly similar \\\"self sacrifice to save everyone\\\" minutes later was bad. Ironically\\, by saying the later sacrifice was bad the first sacrifice meant literally nothing. ","true":true}
