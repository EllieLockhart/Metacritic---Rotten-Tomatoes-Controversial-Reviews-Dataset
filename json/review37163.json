Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only Star Wars film worse than this one is The Phantom Menace. Apart from a few semi-decent scenes\\, and good visuals\\, the film disappointed me in just about every possible way. The cast is great\\, but the characters they portray are garbage. Crap humor. And worst of all: the outright destruction of everything that makes Luke Skywalker so wonderful and beloved. I'll never spend money on this franchise again. #NotABot","true":true}
