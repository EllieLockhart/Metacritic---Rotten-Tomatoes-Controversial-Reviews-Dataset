Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed with the whole Snoke story\\, it was lazy and rushed. Then we have Rei\\, who has no training at all\\, but yoda says she already knows more than is in the old scrolls\\, which leaves you wondering what scrolls as there was no mention of them before.. Yoda has sure changed his tune from the days of refusing to train Anakin  because he is too old.","true":true}
