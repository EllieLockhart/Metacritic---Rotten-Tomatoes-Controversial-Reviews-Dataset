Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Honestly what a piece of **** **** Even the incredible combat system and outstanding graphics aren\u2019t enough to redeem this game of its terrible story. So this game is Ellie trying to kill Abby\\, so why the **** do we play as Abby. The theatre scene when you\u2019re playing as Abby trying to kill Ellie pissed me the **** off because it makes no sense. You expect us to care about Abby when we see her torture Joel\\, pop Jessi in the face\\, shoot out Tommy\u2019s eye\\, and nearly kill Dina? **** that shrek step sister looking ass **** And we wanna see her literally get ****ed? I almost threw up when I saw that ****\u2019s man **** And that **** ending. You\u2019re telling me Ellie tortures Nora and gets about 5 tactical nukes from killing all those **** scars and wolfs but at the end\\, the person that she killed everyone for gets to live. The message at the end was supposed to be \u201crevenge is bad\u201d but it\u2019s not a good message considering all you do in this game is kill ****ers. I\u2019m literally never gonna play this game again in my life\\, I\u2019ve played the first one about 6 times and I could still go back to it and have a blast. This game has no replayability considering the story pisses you off.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
