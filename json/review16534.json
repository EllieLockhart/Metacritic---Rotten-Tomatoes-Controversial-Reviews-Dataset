Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In all four aspects of the sense\\, from the Star Wars universe as a whole\\, from only the Star Wars movies\\, to this new trilogy alone\\, to this alone standing movie\\, there are only disappointments. After you walk out of the movie theater and all the adrenaline wears off\\, and the cinemantics and visual effects fades off\\, you realize what a slap in the face this is to all Star Wars fans. The inconsistencies\\, plot holes and poor story writing have now killed the Star Wars series. ","true":true}
