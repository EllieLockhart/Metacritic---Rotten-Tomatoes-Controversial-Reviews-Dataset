They all talk about the scenario.\r\rScenario: Not as charming as the first game\\, but way more creative. People confuse their anger towards the events with the quality of the scenario\\, whether you agree or not with the scenarist's choices the writing in this game is great. The story will make you feel all sorts of emotions\\, will tear you apart and leave you in the dark credits with only a soft guitar rift to process what just happened to you. It's brutal\\, realistic\\, and not sugar-coated with Hollywood's ''feel good'' clich\u00e9s. The story takes liberties and risks to try to be something different rather than going in the fan-pleasing route\\, as an immense fan of the first installment\\, I appreciate that.\r\rI don't want to spoil anything because I think to appreciate the game fully you need to just blindly jump in it\\, but please give this game the chance it deserves and play through the entire thing and come here to give it an honest score.\r\rWe need to counter all those crazy people blinded by rage who are trying to review-bomb this game without even playing it or\\, just as bad\\, by giving it a 0\/10\\, completely ignoring the incredible graphical work\\, music\\, sound design\\, animation\\, bug testing and actor performances that went into this game because they didn't like the scenario. Even a story-driven game is more than just a story\\, they hurt the entire single-player story-driven game market by doing that and it worries me that companies will decide the battle royal genre or buggy\\, repetitive and clich\u00e9 annual franchises are the only games worth investing in.\r\rIn short: An incredible game wasted on the worst gamer generation in history\\, blinded by hype\\, story leaks\\, and their own idea of what the story should be. (also\\, it pains me to say this\\, even homophobia)\rTo me\\, this game is a masterpiece but I understand reasonable complaints that people have that could lower this game to a 7 or 8 out of 10\\, but below that it's just unreasonable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
