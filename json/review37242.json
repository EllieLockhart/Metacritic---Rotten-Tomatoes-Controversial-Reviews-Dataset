Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The (paid) critics reviews are the most accurate regarding Last Jedi. It was really good\\, moved the story forward\\, and was visually awesome. These negative reviews I\u2019ve read are not accurate at all. ","true":true}
