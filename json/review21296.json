Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in very excited for this film and wanted to love it. Unfortunately\\, I did not. There are really excellent scenes that rank high in the franchise. Overall\\, this movie just missed the overall marks for me. The \\\"twists\\\" n but maybe he's good but he's really bad. This happens with at least four main characters in this movie. In the end\\, everything is back to where you started anyway. The biggest problem I had however was the forced modern humor. It didn't fit for me and completely pulled me out of the drama of it all. I know many people are into it. I may be the odd man out here but it's just not for me.","true":true}
