{"101487":147687,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would not recommend The Last Jedi at all.\\n\\nWasted potential... erratic pacing that never hits its stride... too many characters with not enough time to get to know & care about them... an over-reliance on CGI & special effects & explosions... accents (that \\\"Texan\\\" in the casino) and mannerisms (the \\\"Code Breaker\\\" saying \\\"yeah man\\\" and \\\"cracking\\\") that feel completely out of place... forced and sometimes formulaic dialogue\\, especially given to the new actors... screenwriting of Luke Skywalker that didn't feel at all like his character (only saved by Mark Hamill's great performance)... strange cinematography choices that felt un-Star Wars (e.g. \\\"National Geographic\\\" cutscenes during Rey's training)... and storytelling that was just a mess (\\\"sacred Jedi texts\\\"? where did those come from? why should I care?).\\n\\nOn the surface it *looked* like \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, but the nihilistic and cynical themes did not feel like Star Wars to me. I didn't leave the theater uplifted like after watching Empire Strikes Back\\, for example. Everything felt muddled and grey and gloomy - and that's not the Star Wars I know and love. Is this really what a new generation wants? I sincerely hope not.","true":true}
