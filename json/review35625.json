Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is amazing! It's at least as good as Empire. Rian Johnson is a master story teller. I'm tired of all these fan boys who grew up loving star wars just wanting to be a child forever. It's time to grow up fanboys. The Last Jedi is so intelligent. From the heart stopping action to the compelling characters\\, Rian Johnson seamlessly blended the old with the new and took Star Wars to the next level. Not looking forward to Episode IX cause J.J. will just ruin it again. Can't wait for the new trilogy from Rian Johnson. Just imagine what he will be able to do without being constrained like he was by J.J. in this movie.","true":true}
