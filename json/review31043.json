Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So good! They took things in exciting new directions. With the requisite fan service out of the way in force awakens\\, we are ready to get down to business. Though the casino scene is a bit tedious and Poe's story is heavy handed\\, it's more than made up for with the main story with Rey\\, Kylo\\, Luke\\, and the terrifyingly powerful Snoke. And the special effects and sound are stunning. Highly recommend this movie!","true":true}
