Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They're trying to say now that they the bad reviews of this movie is just bots\\, trolls\\, the Alt right and men so rights activists-people you should hate! Bad dishonest people.Yeah\\, they'd like you to believe that cause that meansople will keep paying to see their shit movie. Honestly\\, it's not a conspiracy. There's a simpler explanation and that's that the movie was goddamn terrible. These people understand nothing about what made Star Wars special to so many and instead give you a dumbed down action packed shit fest full of cardboard characters that I honestly don't care if live or die.  I miss George Lucas so much. I'll defend the prequels any day against the last Jedi which is absolute garbage. I'm a person-a disappointed Star Wars fan-a girl-not a men's rights activist-and a Democrat-not from the alt right-and I just genuinely hated this movie because it wasn't well written\\, wasn't true to the characters\\, and lacked heart.","true":true}
