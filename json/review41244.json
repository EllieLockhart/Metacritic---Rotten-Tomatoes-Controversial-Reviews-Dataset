Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is about a 3.5 to 4 for me\\, but rating it 5 to counteract all the morons giving this movie a 1\/2 star and calling it the worst movie of all time.... I for one am glad Disney is not catering to the out of control Star Wars fanboys who hold Ep 4\\,5\\,6 as all that is holy despite the fact there are more flaws in the original trilogy than anything in this movie....","true":true}
