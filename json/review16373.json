Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Impressive visuals\\, but narratively incompetent. The creators of this film are clearly out of touch and lack the ability to write a story with any degree of cohesion or sensible characterization. Not only that\\, the movie actively seeks to unravel the films that come before it in a poor attempt to \\\"subvert expectations\\\"\\, but comes off pretentious\\, tone deaf\\, and outright unenjoyable. I will not be consuming modern Star Wars any longer until they prove to me that they are capable of making a decent film\\, but I'm not holding my breath for that to happen any time soon.","true":true}
