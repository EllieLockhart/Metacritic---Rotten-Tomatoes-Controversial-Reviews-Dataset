{"101487":115524,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't enjoy myself at this film at all.  Nothing like a Star Wars movie\\, just a ton of fanservice\\, and self-insert wish-fulfilling.  I hated Rose the most\\, because you could take her out of the movie completely and lose nothing.  The romance between her and Fin was incredibly forced\\, and she robbed Fin of the only redeeming thing he could have done in the movie altogether.\\n\\nPeople are touting Rey as this impossibly great character because she's already strong with the Force and whatnot.  Would you rather your strong female lead be handed everything because they were deep-down a magical girl on the inside\\, or overcome true and crushing adversity and hardship in order to earn it?   Well\\, this movie does a whole heaping helping of the former.\\n\\nYou get women in strong leads\\, which is a good change of pace nowadays\\, but most of them feel forced into place because \\\"GENDER EQUALITY\\\" rather than an actual character that belongs.  If Rose had more going for her than \\\"I just so happened to be a character at the right place at the right time with the right job\\\" and more of a fleshed out character than \\\"My sister is dead but it's okay\\, I have this hot black accessory to keep me happy as I smile in front of all these green screens\\\"\\, I would have loved the character.\\n\\nThe Force Bond between Rey and Kylo could have lead to an AMAZING feat of Storytelling\\, where Light and Dark fall in love but resolve to end one another\\, or the two gain some sort of real understanding of each other\\, making their confrontation even more powerful\\, but its all brought low by the fact that it was Snoke the entire time.\\n\\nSpeaking of\\, I've never seen a lamer Super Villain for a story.  \\\"I can see the future\\, but I can't see whats going on an inch away from my left arm.\\\"  \\n\\nIts like this movie couldn't tell if it wanted to be for kids\\, or adults.  It goes in one wacky\\, zany\\, kid friendly direction then veers back to the dark and gritty side of things.  It's like watching a WORSE Rogue One\\, if thats possible.\\n\\nOh\\, and they shit all over Yoda's legacy towards the end.  Like it's absolutely brilliant\\, whoever came up with that scene should be a legend.  They use what I could only assume to be a McDonalds version of Yoda for this scene.\\n\\nBut people are going to watch this\\, they're going to look past all of the flaws and terrible crap and scream \\\"AAAAH\\, LOOK AT ROSE! SHES MY FAVORITE CHARACTER\\, WE'RE SOOOOOOOOO RELATEABLE\\\" or how Rey and Kylo touched fingertips and are now a couple\\, even though she clearly rejects him.\\n\\nThere are SOME good parts.  Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is one of\\, if not THE BEST acting in this film.  When Mark is on screen\\, the scene just comes alive\\, whether he's moving around in it\\, or standing stationary and talking.\\n\\nOther than that\\, all I see another mass of wasted potential kept behind super safe directing with a completely lost agenda.   2\/10","true":true}
