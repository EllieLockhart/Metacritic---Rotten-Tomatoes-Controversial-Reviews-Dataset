Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed in the whole movie. It felt way too busy in the progression of the the storyline and didn't deliver a dramatic ending like I wish it would have. The non humorous comedic one liners\\, poor acting\\, and lack of excitement for Luke's role; really makes me question the directors perspective on Star wars in general.","true":true}
