Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many people went in with the perception that they knew how things would play out; what I mean by that is that people have become accustomed to Star Wars films and what the main trilogy should be like. This movie is the middle of two others\\, it is a connector between the exposition and the resolution of a much bigger story line. It has old story lines as well as new ones. Some questions are answered while others are still left to be debated. Go in with the idea that this movie will not be what you think and you\u2019ll enjoy it. ","true":true}
