Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a flawed and underwhelming movie. The 2 1\/2 hour run time is used to shove social commentary down the viewer's throat. It's abolishes any excitment created by the episode before it and the constant joking made me forget I was watching a Star Wars film. Terrible waste of time. Prequels looking pretty good after watching this","true":true}
