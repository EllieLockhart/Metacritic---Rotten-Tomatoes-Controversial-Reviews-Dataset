Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the best Star Wars film along with Empire. Absolutely amazing. Complex story that ties together in the end with a perfect way to end and continue onto Episode IX. Rian Johnson outdoes himself\\, and gives the franchise a fresh and daring new installment. Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver and the whole cast give better than perfect 11\/10 performances. Perfect farewell performance by Carrie Fisher\\, who remains the spark of hope for the saga. Along with the onstage cast\\, the offstage crew absolutely aims high in visuals and production\\, that make this movie perfect. This movie was long\\, at 2 1\/2 hours\\, but it pays off in a well-paced beautifully made story. ","true":true}
