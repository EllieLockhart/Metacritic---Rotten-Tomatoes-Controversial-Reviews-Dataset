Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The story choices sucked\\, instead of using the already existing depth of the characters\\, they killed Joel and pushed aside Tommy\\, new characters have zero depth\\, Ellie was turned into a punk with anger issues\\, most of the dialogues and the acting that comes with them were cring and awkward  accept of Joel and Tommy\\, the game play was boring adn repetitive except few sequences\\, there was nothing original in terms of the game play\\, except the guitar thing\\, the puzzles ... were lame and so easy and they felt like fillers\\, the AI was terrible\\, you are literally side by side with the enemy yet they don't detect you\\, I didn't like the pacing of it\\, the music was not impressive\\, the graphics were awesome I'll give them that but we have already seen games with that level of detail such as DS\\, character design same **** from the old game\\, weapons and system management is exactly the same as the previous game\\, They didn't even explain the world conflict in any depth and I felt lost \\, it felt so one-dimensional. it was trash!\rWaited seven years for this\\, what a joke!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
