Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I so wanted to like this film\\, coming on the back of 7 and rogue one\\, which were both decent.  Instead I left the cinema annoyed and quite deflated\\, largely I agreed with a colleague of mine\\, who felt that the beginning was decent\\, the end was also decent enough\\, but the middle felt flat with a lot of in-jokes\\, over the top cheesiness and \\\"filler\\\" dressed up as a homage to the past films\\, at time it was like it had toy placements throughout with the porg.  The originals did indeed have cheesiness\\, but not in the same way that this film hammed it up at times.\\n\\nStorytelling and writing was awful in places with the characters stagnating and not really doing much around the filler that was taking place.\\n\\nSuch potential\\, but came to nothing overall I thought","true":true}
