Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A new epic to the saga one with just the right amount of classic Star Wars but just enough new things to keep it fresh an exciting. While the first half suffers from a secondary plot line\\, the second half is so strong that it makes up for its short comings.","true":true}
