Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this movie was Epic!  My family loved it.  I think those that dislike it are just plain wrong.  I enjoyed the humor.  I enjoyed the special effects.  I didn't mind the length of the film (the more Star Wars\\, the better).  I loved the surprises.  If you enjoyed the original trilogy and Force Awakens\\, then I think you will enjoy this film.","true":true}
