Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ WAS TRASH AND BELONGS IN the bargain bin at walmart.  this movie single handed killed the franchise.  so much bad it would take to long to write all down.  since my horrible choice to go see this at the midnight showing\\, wearing my tlj shirt\\, i have not watched this movie.  never will.  star wars ended at episode 6.","true":true}
