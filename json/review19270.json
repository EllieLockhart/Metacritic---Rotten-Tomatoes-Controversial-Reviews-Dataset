Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not fun to watch\\, the characters don't feel like they are in danger\\, they could have killed of Carrie Fisher but the let her live and it doesn't finish off any of they questions asked in the last movie. It created more problems for the next film maker like killing off leia\\, making phasma more useful and just changing it up. This movie could have been fixed if it felt time went by since the force awakens but it didn't this movie takes place like 2 days after that movie","true":true}
