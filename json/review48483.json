Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With The Last Jedi\\, they brought more depth to all of the characters\\, and the actors really nailed it with this one. It is stunning visually and beautiful to watch everything play out in front of you. Of course\\, there were a few moments that seemed out of place but overall a very good movie!","true":true}
