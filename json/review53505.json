Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars movie I've seen. Awesome fight scenes\\, truly interesting themes\\, VERY intelligent manipulations of audience expectations\\, and strong cinematography throughout. And most importantly\\, it evoked the same feelings for me as the original trilogy.\\n\\nPeople who rail on the film are mostly diehard fans who are upset that this film features dynamic characters and adds real alterations to the traditional Star Wars formula...or people who took those fans at their word when they said the movie was bad. I won't go into detail for fear of spoilers\\, but real people change over the course of their lives\\, and Luke's changes in outlook due to the events between Episode 6 and this episode are not only believable but the reason that he is one of this episode's most interesting characters. The dozens of other \\\"plot holes\\\" I've heard brought up are (with the singular exception of Holdo's poor communication with Poe) simply failures to read between the lines.\\n\\nThis is a very clever film that also expects a more from its audience than the original trilogy\\, and the (at the time of this writing) 90% critic score reflects that.","true":true}
