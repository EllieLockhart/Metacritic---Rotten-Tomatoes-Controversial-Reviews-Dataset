Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you haven't watched star wars movies before\\, you will enjoy this movie.  If you've seen any of them before\\, this movie will drive you mad.  It almost feels like he is insulting the star wars universe.  This movie made me really sad after I watched it.  Great cinematic and acting.","true":true}
