Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only redeeming thing about this movie are the visuals and even some of those aren't great.\\n\\nThe plots (there are a few that merge) are terribly written with holes as large as the hypothetical \\\"galaxy far far away\\\".\\n\\nThe acting is melodramatic at best. I mean Mark Hamil was never a good actor anyway but this director gets the worst out of him. What we wouldn't give to have Alec Guiness back. \\n\\nThe choice of actors for the new characters is terrible \\n\\nThe direction is choppy \\n\\nStar Wars tech has never been close to sci fi reality but this movie doesn't even come close to solid tech.  And why come up with idiotic vehicles just to show something new \\n\\nI'm not sure after this I would see the next installment","true":true}
