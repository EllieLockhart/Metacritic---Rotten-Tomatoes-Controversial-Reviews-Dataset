Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars movie\\, it was garbage. But when you stop looking at it as just a Star Wars movie\\, and really take a step back\\, it's still hot garbage. The movie is riddled with plot holes and useless characters that you can't help but wish death upon. There are are countless scenes where continuity and logic are thrown out of the window. Meaning\\, emotion\\, and Star Wars Lore are tossed out the window for cheap jokes. This movie is a mess and should have never been made. Shame on you\\, Ryan Johnson.","true":true}
