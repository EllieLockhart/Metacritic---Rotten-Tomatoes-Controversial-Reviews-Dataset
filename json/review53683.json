Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a directorial perspective this movie is a masterpiece. Rian Johnson stripped so many layers off the main characters that the effect was nothing short of a shock to the fan base.  It felt as if he almost didn't have enough time to pack all of the nuances of these characters along the story line into one episode.  It was far beyond what we see in typical sci-fi movies but so worth the risk.  The placement of key plot developments was masterful.  Scene transition assisted with questions about the characters\\, or total silence or thematic music material to emphasize key dramatic moments - Johnson really excelled here.  And his emotional\\, dark vision would not have come through without John William's brilliant score.  This score resembles Schindler's List more than Star Wars. I think it's one of Williams' best works - bravo.  Curious where Abrams' vision fits in all this..","true":true}
