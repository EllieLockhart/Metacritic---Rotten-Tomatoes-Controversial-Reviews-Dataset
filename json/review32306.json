Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has a massive history\\, not just including the 8 films out now. There is a lot of history that fans have studied over the years and many many rules created by Lucas that were thrown out the window here.\\n\\nIt is equivalent of going to another country and insulting another's culture which can be seen as ignorant and rude.","true":true}
