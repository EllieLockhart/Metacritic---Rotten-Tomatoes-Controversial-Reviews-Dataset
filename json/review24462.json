Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More than disappointing all the way through\\, a poorly written and developed storyline for one of the series most iconic characters Luke Skywalker\\, forced situations with Finn and Rey\\, this movie in general just feels like a typical Hollywood 21st century title......aimed to make money and lacking in creativity.","true":true}
