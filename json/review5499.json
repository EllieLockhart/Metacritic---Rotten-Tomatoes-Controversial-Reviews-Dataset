Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed the image of Luke; how on earth Leia can now fly?; Snoke\\, just like that? Rey's parents???\\n\\nThe good sides are the effects\\, musics and sound\\n\\nBut storywise? Need lots of respect to the characters and its history\\n\\nDisappointed","true":true}
