Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the biggest failure has a Star Wars movie\\, completely disjointed\\, super bad writing and unnecessary story arcs that was a pain to watch\\, the director Rian Johnson doesn't know that he is doing\\, he completely destroyed the foundation of The Force Awakens that J.J Abrams make. don't waste your money in this movie\\, Disney doesn't know how to handle a franchise this big. a total failure","true":true}
