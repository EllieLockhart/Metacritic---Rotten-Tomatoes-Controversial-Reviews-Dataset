Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The simple fact that this episode in the Star Wars saga receives such a low rating by fans is the simple fact that storyline is more important than the special effects bling. Yes\\, we go to be entertained by the special effects\\, it\u2019s Star Wars. We expect nothing less than to be awed by massive spaceships and explosions. What continues to be missing time and again is a good story that is believable and the fans can become immersed in. This episode just didn\u2019t have that and thus failed.","true":true}
