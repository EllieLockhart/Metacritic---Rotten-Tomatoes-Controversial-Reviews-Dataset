Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Star Wars film with something to say. At times\\, it's perhaps a bit too much to say (like the lessons on war profiteers that feel out of place in the film)\\, but generally the message it has about the nature of the force and balance is a nice addition to the mythos of the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
