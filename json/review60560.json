Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I was simply looking forward to this game in a surreal way\\, and I understand the fans' anger over Joel's premature death\\, and I know how it hurt to see the scene of his death. And play with Abby at first it is also extremely painful and sad. But only because of this can we realize that the game is actually a plot of consequences\\, not just revenge. We realized that everthing that Abby do\\, and Ellie do\\,  in a unstoppable search to compensate for death is in vain\\, and it was useless\\, both lost everything\\, their friends\\, their family\\, just to feel the pleasure of \\\"getting revenge\\\".The way that the game show us that slowly\\, is awesome and unbelievable\\, I can say easily that's one of the best games of the generation\\, and I fell a lot of emotions do from beginning to end. The game demonstrates that in an apocalyptic world\\, there is no happiness\\, and good things are minimal. Joel's death was painful\\, but like so many others\\, sudden and frightening\\, in a world of those\\, there is no heroic death\\, good or just\\, everything happens on the basis of survival\\, nobody is hero\\, and nobody are bad.
