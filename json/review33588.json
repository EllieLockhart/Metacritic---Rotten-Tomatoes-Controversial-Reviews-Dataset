Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. I can't save almost anything. Plot holes\\, horrible characters development\\, around 60% of the running time totally pointless and boring. \\nWorst of all\\, is unforgivable the way all the plot lines have been treated.  It looks like they had no idea on how to work on those and they simply trashed them in the lamest way possible. \\nI already didn't like much Ep.7 but this time around they dig the grave of the entire series. It's around the same quality of episode 1. With a worst plot.","true":true}
