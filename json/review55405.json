Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Major disappointment! It's almost like Disney has now set out to destroy the Star Wars universe. They've destroyed the Jedi\\, declared they were all hypocrites and fools and at the same time everyone in the movie runs around saying \\\"may the force be with you\\\". And now using the force requires no training. What a waste of the storylines available in the Star Wars universe while presumably going off on some new adventure. I guess the all-female resistance traveling on board the Falcon will save the galaxy.  Apart from destroying the Jedi and their reason for being the movie was filled with such ridiculous scenes as the casino. A scene entirely devoted to bashing the rich and ultimately revealing to us that the resistance is just as evil as the first order because\\, well\\, they buy weapons. Please save us from politics in our fantasy movies!! My recommmedation is that Disney burn this movie and pretend it never happened and start over and give us what we deserve. I thought they were on the right track with Force Awakens and Rogue One but now I'm not sure I'll ever be able to watch another one.","true":true}
