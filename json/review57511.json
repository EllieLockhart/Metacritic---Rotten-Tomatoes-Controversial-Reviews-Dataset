Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fantastic Star Wars movie! I don't have the nostalgia factor of watching the original movies when the first came out\\, so that doesn't affect how I view The Last Jedi.\\nWith that disclaimer\\, this movie was fantastic and by far my favorite in the movie line! The costumes and background details are exquisite\\, the amount of wildlife that is integrated into the world is also really neat to see. They definitely crammed a lot of story into one movie and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! My entire theatre was cheering\\, crying\\, clapping and laughing throughout the film which really tells me it is well done to elicit such emotion! \\nIt's a wonderful movie\\, go see it!","true":true}
