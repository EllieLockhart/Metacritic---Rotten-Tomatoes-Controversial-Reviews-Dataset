Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You go Rian Johnson! Someone who finally broke the formulaic approach that Star Wars has been receiving for the past few films. The characters had actual heart this time??? Incredible. I remember being just a bit bored watching Star Wars films that were made post 1983\\, but this one actually kept me engaged\\, on the edge of my seat\\, and SURPRISED. Such a lack of cheap gimmicks (ones which JJ Abrams seem to have a knack for) was really so refreshing. Having humor mixed in realistically with serious tones helped give depth to the characters\\, which I had thought lost on the franchise. I never thought Disney would take such risks with this franchise\\, but wow do I love them for it! Go ahead and let a couple minor inconsistencies distract from a movie that has warmth\\, soul\\, and an assortment of moments that fill the viewer with awe. I\u2019m honestly in shock over how beautiful the shots were and how everything was so thematically ties together! If you walk out of there confused about how you felt\\, give it ONE more watch. You will definitely decide by then whether you love this film or hate it. Or don\u2019t see it again! Makes no difference to me\\, because I will continue to love this movie","true":true}
