We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It is zero score. I had to give the maximum score to rate it properly\\, ZERO. For me\\, this game is a crime against humanity. It hurts really deep down all the fans that spent so many hours with Joel and Ellie.. and ecperienced so much.. creating a bond with the characters even.. and I think that this game is intended to hurt the people the most so they can call it \\\"a masterpiece\\\". If this game is their intelectual property... DO WE NOT HAVE RIGHTS to protect our mind and well being from this sad and trafic event in gaming history? The responsible for this game existence should know that his decisions will have an impact so negative in TLOU fans lifes.. I personally I was devastated.. and didnt feel well.. and notice many players stopped it right after Joel Death part.. its overwhelming...this shouldnt be allowed for people\/fans\/players to experience. I can't say anything anynore about this. Please\\, save yourself and do not give your money for this. Remember to choose wisely where you spend your money\\, it's like voting. A vote of faith. And they have broken fans\/people\/players faith\\, a lot of  players will drop a tear as I did.. and stopped the video on youtube. All I hope for the rest of you\\, is stay safe until the end. Be happy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
