Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the movie entertaining\\, fun\\, shocking\\, nostalgic\\, and humorous. Luke remains the hope we once believed him to be. Leia finally wields her power we all wished we would get to see. Yoda remains the wisest master. And as for the new characters\\, they choose to be who they wish to be. They are not bound by destiny\\, but survive to continue their fights for what they believe. War is not fun. There are winners and losers on both sides. This film ends with the continuation that HOPE is always within reach. Anakin\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, and now Rey all serve to be that hope the the galaxy. Bravo to Rian Johnson for taking me on a ride that I thoroughly enjoyed. ","true":true}
