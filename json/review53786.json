Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great! The best star wars films since Empire! Kylo Ren is a FANTASTIC villain\\, Rey once again shines and this is the most complex we've seen Luke. Mark Hamill gives a tremendous performance\\, his best of the series. the action scenes are also the best of the series. The music is once again great\\, and the film is visaully beautiful. This film is very unpredictable\\, for the first time in Star Wars since 1983. Overall\\, it's a great film and a worthy addition to teh Star Wars mythos","true":true}
