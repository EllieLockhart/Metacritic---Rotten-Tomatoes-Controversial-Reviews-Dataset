Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian's attempt to turn the essence of a Star Wars movie on its head and then quickly turn tail at the end and make it a Star Wars movie after all has failed\\, and miserably. What a waste\\, they should have had JJ Abrams continue with is epic Star Wars saga than give it to this other \u2018Brick' of a director. Not recommended.","true":true}
