Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't know how to review this movie without spoiling it. I was incredibly disappointed by The Last Jedi. I believe it to be the worst of the Star Wars movies. Pacing was all over the place\\, the attempts at humor felt off\\, and the villains are now jokes.","true":true}
