Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never been more let down by a film\\, i lvoe star wars as much as anyone\\, and was so hyped up by the critics reviews and the overwhelming sense that this may be the best star wars ever\\, the trailers only excited me more!\\n\\nhowever the film felt its length\\, with some incredibly stupid scenes in places and i felt myself looking at the time throughout as it really did drag.\\n\\nit seems this film set about destroying so many plots and story points from the previous with such ease\\, that i really dont see where the film series will go after this. never been more disappointed after coming out of the cinema\\, felt more like phantom menace than Empire Strikes back","true":true}
