Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a serious\\, die-hard\\, fan who has spent more than one night camped in a convention center in pursuit of all things Star Wars. I loved this movie. I felt shell-shocked after my first viewing\\, uncertain what to think\\, but the more I process it\\, the more I love it. It's easier to enjoy on second-viewing\\, because you aren't having your mind-blown every other scene. It is a highly complex and beautiful film\\, and I think Rain Johnson hit it out of the park. I have quibbles here and there\\, but if this is where Star Wars is headed\\, I'm on board. Luke was my favorite character growing up\\, and I thought his arc in this movie was totally believable and very moving. It makes me crazy when negative reviews say this movie is universally hated by hardcore fans. It just isn't true. For this Star Wars-obsessed nerd\\, the Last Jedi is a winner. Go see it.","true":true}
