Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"honestly.... I have to say I was disappointed. I expected so much going into that movie theater. I have seen it 5 times and each time I have tried to make myself love it for what it is... but it's just not good enough. I surely don't hate it but it had so much potential. it had its moments but it was just kinda bland overall. not one of my favorite star wars movies.","true":true}
