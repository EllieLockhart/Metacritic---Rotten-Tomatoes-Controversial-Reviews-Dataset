Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has to be the best Star Wars movie in the franchise imo\\,besides The Empire Strikes Back.Finally a original plot without a death star.The story was phenomenal and loved the passion in every scene.I for the life of me cannot understand a certain amount of hate for this film?!Love to see the fresh take\\,and see where this franchise will go next.My only regret was Finn not dying\\,can't stand the guy who plays him.Not a fan of his desperate attempt in trying to be the cool bad ass\\,overactor!That was my only complaint.Loved this film!","true":true}
