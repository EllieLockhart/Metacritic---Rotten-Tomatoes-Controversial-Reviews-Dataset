{"101487":149736,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-10-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start off by saying The Last Jedi (TLJ) has some redeemable aspects. The CGI was completely top class\\, and the visual effects were incredible. Also\\, some of the action was good and the humor was at times good.\\n\\nThe first issue I will raise is involving the light speed maneuver. This forever changes the Star Wars space battles as it completely disregards previously established lore that light speed is in another dimension in which you travel faster. From now on\\, every space battle in a Star Wars movie people will be expecting either faction in the conflict to employ this strategy. This scene also disregards every previous space battle in the saga's history\\, as this surely would have been used before\\, if not only as a kamikaze attempt. In the next movie\\, the creative team will probably have to create some contrived 'hyper-shield' to stop this from happening again. This is a perfect example of style of substance. Edit: I now have been informed that large structures have a \u2018shadow mass' in hyperspace. The main problem presented in this point should now be about how this has never been used before.\\n\\nIn addition\\, half the plot is completely contrived. From the moment Laura Dern's character comes in and is secretive to Poe (who is known to be completely loyal but also hot-headed and prone to solving problems himself) it causes half the plot to happen. There is no reason for Dern's character to do this\\, and considering half the Resistance's leadership just died he may be one of the most appropriate people to tell. Half the point of this is probably to kick-start Finn and Roses adventure to Space Vegas\\, which was a whole completely useless subplot.\\n\\nFurthermore\\, Rian Jhonson and the creative team completely disregarded the previous film in order to have the protagonists be underdogs. There is no reason for the Republic funded resistance to having this little of a fleet. This is partially the fault of The Force Awakens for a lack of initial world-building but there is no reason for the previously victorious rebels to be down to 9 useless bombers\\, a few X-Wings\\, 1 cruiser\\, and 3 medical friggets. Given this takes place immediately after the events of TFA there is no way a comic or TV show explains this.\\n\\nThe Space Vegas portion of the film is completely cringe-worthy. The obvious anti-capitalism theme is ironic\\, considering that this trilogy seems to more and more be looking like and unplanned cash-grab from the corporate enterprise that is Disney. This entire scene could have been cut for more world-building if Maz was available to be the master code-breaker and was not just in the film for 30 seconds to meet a diversity quota.\\n\\nThe movie completely destroys Luke's character. The man who converted the evilest man ever to the light side was always hopeful and optimistic would not try and kill his sister and best friends child\\, who was just a boy. He is shown as a grumpy\\, miserable old fart. The sadness on Mark Hamill's face during interviews regarding this film is telling. My favorite part of the movie is when Luke walks out of the rebel base alone and faces the army of AT-ATs alone\\, but this is ruined by him making a brushing the shoulders gesture\\, which is completely out of character for him.\\n\\nRey is also a complete Mary Sue. Her power would be understandable if she was the daughter of someone relevant like maybe Palpatine\\, Kenobi\\, or maybe even Luke but she is 'nothing'. She faces no challenges and has no relatable character flaws unless being bored with being too strong is one. She pilots the Falcon better than Han\\, she is the strongest force user ever (Luke even says so) and can beat Kylo in a duel.\\n\\nThe First Order is also portrayed as incompetent and amateur in this film\\, in particular\\, General Hux. Their actions in the space chase make no sense. General Hux\\, who was previously intimidating and one of the few snew trilogy characters I like is played for slapstick and laughs. Kylo goes from being menacing to an angsty teenager in minutes. If the reason for half your plot is the antagonists are incompetent or dumb\\, your movie is badly written.\\n\\nThe final issue I'll raise in this main body of the text is how the film had about 0 original ideas. Yes\\, there were one or two vaguely new ones but it's undeniable that a lot of this film was cut and pasted from episode 5 and 6. The new trilogy is obviously trying to show they were more like the originals.\\n\\nI will also clarify that at points the film was enjoyable somewhat\\, but that doesn't mean it is any better\\, so if someone could explain these major fundamental flaws in this movie then I could change my view. So far people have just said 'well I enjoyed it'\\, which seems to be based upon all the fan service.","true":true}
