Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is a long series with many ups and downs\\, and after the Force Awakens\\, its formula was starting to get old. Choosing Rian Johnson to direct such a big-budget film was a risky move by Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy\\, but it ultimately paid off. \\nJohnson has completely refreshed Star Wars\\, giving it a chance to continue without repetitiveness or staleness. No other director could have pulled off something like this \\nwith such a flourish of amazing visual symbolism\\, interesting story\\, great character renderings\\, uproarious comedy\\, and glorious action scenes. This is definitely a Star Wars movie to be remembered\\, but one that is not without it's flaws. The Canto Bight scene\\, while beautiful\\, drags on and ultimately accomplishes nothing\\, as does Benicio Del Toro's entertaining but unnecessary character. All in all\\, Rian Johnson did a surprisingly great job with The Last Jedi\\, and it is no wonder that he is getting to start his own trilogy which will undoubtedly be as good or better!","true":true}
