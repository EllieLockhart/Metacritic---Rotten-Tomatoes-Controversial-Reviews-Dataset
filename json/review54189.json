{"101487":132287,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Skywalker was the same guy we knew\\, we wouldn't have needed three more movies.  The reasons given were compelling.  The way Skywalker engages was awesome.  The head fakes and echos were head and shoulders beyond anything in the prequel trilogy.   And anyone who thinks that the Last Jedi drags should watch A New Hope with someone for the first time.\\n\\nAs someone who personally believes in the supernatural\\, namely God\\, I appreciate the refocusing on the Force - the Jedi don't own the Force\\, they don't own the Light\\, they serve the Light.  Our human institutions don't define spiritual reality\\, they only point to it.  The Jedi are a human institution\\, and the Force can obviously awaken who it will\\, use who it wills.  When we look at human institutions\\, they rise and fall\\, they wax and wane.  Either the Force is beyond all of that or it isn't.  Renewal\\, Reformation\\, Revival doesn't have to look like our current reality\\, in fact\\, it shouldn't.  People who want things the way they were might care more about the success of a human institution\\, in this case the Jedi Order\/Jedi Religion\\, versus the reality (in that world) of the Force.  \\n\\nNot that anyone cares\\, but it is now my second favorite Star Wars\\, just behind Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nBest lightsaber battles\\, period.   After watching it again. it even beats Obi Wan\/Maul and the Luke\/Vader rematch.\\n\\nIf I were to deduct half a star\\, it would be over that nasty milk scene.  :p","true":true}
