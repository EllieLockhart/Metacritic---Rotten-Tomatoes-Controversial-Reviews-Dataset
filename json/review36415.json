Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

Non of the forced jokes were any fun\\, everything interesting about TFA was completely wasted in this movie. The abilities of all the Jedi  were all over the place and weopoinzing lightspeed must have been the worst idea in Star Wars history. At least it Looks and sounds like Star Wars...","true":true}
