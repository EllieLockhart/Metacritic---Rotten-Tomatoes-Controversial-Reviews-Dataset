Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the special effects were great. Unfortunately\\, that is not what makes a great movie and that is why I don't like the movie! I thought the Characters plots and story as a star wars film was terrible! Rian Johnson is a great film director but he did a terrible job on this movie. It is really too bad after Starwars episode 9 is out I will stop watching Star Wars unless I write and Direct the film someday which I hope Kathleen Kenedy is not around to dictate my decision on the movie\\, anyway thank you Rotten tomato for my input!!!","true":true}
