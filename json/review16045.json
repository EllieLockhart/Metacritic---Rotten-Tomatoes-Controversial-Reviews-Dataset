Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a life long fan of the original trilogy and have waited 30 plus years to see more of Luke and find out what happened in Luke\u2019s life in the interim. The Last Jedi is THE greatest disappointments in my life\\, as far as books\\, comics and movies are concerned. I\u2019m done with Star Wars. Rian Johnson did you get a thrill spitting in the fans faces?","true":true}
