Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story line was so basic and predictable\\, the sub plots were like a child wrote them\\, especially when they went in search of the code breaker. I must say that this is on par with Rogue One and that is not a good thing. But for sure after 2 poor Disney created Star Wars films I will no longer be supporting this once great franchise financially by paying to view another movie.","true":true}
