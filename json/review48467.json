Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With this film it is clear in which direction Disney really wants to take their $4billion investment\\, and it isn't encouraging. \\n\\nWith a script that was clearly influenced by the need to appeal to the large asian box office (which results in painfully uninspired\\, on the nose dialogue throughout)\\, a breakneck pace that doesn't allow any scene to breathe\\, vapid plot lines that the film would've been better off without and constant attempts at Marvel like humour\\, THE LAST JEDI is a true disappointment.","true":true}
