Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My god this was not just an embarrassment for Star Wars fans (I am a casual fan)\\, but a self important dreary fan film. This movie is like a film student\u2019s first draft\\, immediately breaking previous character development and replacing it With nothing of worth other than SUBVERSION. Why in the world did that casino scene get past writing\\, directing\\, AND editing. This is an ugly mesh of incompetent film student skill and corporate mishandling. I liked Lopper and Knives out looks interesting. This was a major misstep for a rising film maker and a devastating  blow to Star Wars fans investment in future films.","true":true}
