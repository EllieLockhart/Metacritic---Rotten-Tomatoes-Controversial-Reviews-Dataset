Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm honestly heart-broken at the outcome of the movie. \\n\\nI was truly trying to love the movie as I was watching it\\, I wanted to like it\\, I really did. But Its not a traditional Star Wars film and it was honestly the strangest Star Wars movie I've ever seen in terms of pace\\, story telling and overall feel. \\n\\nIt seemed like too many stories were trying to be told at once\\, and left a hot mess of a movie. Some of the best parts and reveals of the movie were snuffed out by over saturation of a side story with minor characters\\, or unnecessary plot twists that lead to more unnecessary plot twists. They really let us down on some of the reveals and some characters were gravely disrespected. Among it all there's a visible effort to tell a great story\\, with terrible\\, awful\\, over saturated execution. \\n\\nIt really feels like additional setup for the last movie\\, Episode IX\\, instead of a standalone triumph like every other Star Wars film. The Force Awakens was a much better film\\, and that breaks my heart the most. I thinks we all wanted this movie to delve deep into these new characters\\, and all we got were more questions.","true":true}
