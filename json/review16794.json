Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I not only thought this was my favorite Star Wars movie but the best science fiction movie ever as well. Rian Johnson did an amazing job of making it seem like it was the same formula as The Empire Strikes Back\\, but then changing the formula so much\\, it was an amazing way to include a twist. I think most die-hard Star Wars fans didn't enjoy the movie as there were expectations for it to be the same as before\\, and I think people put the original trilogy on too high a pedestal. For me\\, of course being in the 70's the special effects aren't as good as today\\, the plot was predictable and the dialogue was corny and clich\u00e9 at times. The Last Jedi had me entertained the entire time\\, and very few movies do that for me. I was absolutely amazed and I hope to see it again. My only point of criticism is that Finn didn't get as big a role\\, but I think all the other criticisms of this movie aren't well founded. For example\\, the criticism that there were too many subplots. The subplots all interconnected\\, and not only helped us learn so much more about each character than The Force Awakens did\\, it helped increase tension and all connected to the plot in the end spectacularly. Overall\\, if I could have given this movie 6\/5 I would have.","true":true}
