Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This all falls at the feet of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. Rian Johnson is a joke. This shabby excuse for a story doesn't go anywhere. None of the characters were consequential and none of the stakes were real. NOTHING MATTERED in this film. TLJ was a nihilistic example of all glitz and glamor with zero substance. Rian Johnson in one foul swoop not only undermined The Force Awakens but literally delegitimized the most important protagonist of the original trilogy... LUKE SKYWALKER! What the hell were you people thinking allowing the hack who created \\\"Looper\\\" to make a Star Wars film? I'm done with Star Wars as long as Kathleen Kennedy is in charge. I refuse to see another film and I refuse to buy any more merchandise. You've ruined Star Wars. You BROKE a no brainer franchise! IDIOTS!","true":true}
