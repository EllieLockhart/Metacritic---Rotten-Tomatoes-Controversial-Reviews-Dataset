Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Similar in theme to Empire in many ways but not just a rehash. This film was unpredictable and beautifully filmed. You may or may not approve of each twist\\, but it was certainly fun and felt like a true Star Wars film. What fun would it be if you guessed everything that would happen ahead of time?","true":true}
