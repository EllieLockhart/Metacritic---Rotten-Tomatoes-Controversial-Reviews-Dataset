As fun as the gameplay is\\, it\u2019s not revolutionary by any means\\, and it\u2019s not the kind of gameplay that can be done for hours on end without boredom eventually setting in. In the first game\\, this was counteracted by the games amazing narrative. When the gameplay began to feel slow\\, the story was your motivator for reaching the next segment. This game does not have that same cushion. The story manages to disrespect fans of the original by narratively discarding everything that made the protagonist duo appealing. Worse\\, it does so in a way meant to antagonize you\\, the player. It does so by carrying out its flawed narrative in a manner confirmed by the creator to create negative emotions within you. Hate\\, sadness\\, grief. In a typical film this does give stakes to the plot\\, but there\u2019s usually resolution by the plot\u2019s end to satisfy these feelings of motivation. TLOU2 does not provide this. Instead the game crawls to a snail pace meant to keep you mentally trapped in a dark place for 20-25 hours.When the games climax finally arrives\\, you are denied the closure the game has set you off to pursue. For lack of a better word \u201cNarrative blue balls\u201d. There is meant to be some sort of method to the madness\\, and the game\u2019s director has gone on record saying he knew some would love the narrative while others would dislike it. For me the landing simply did not land\\, and this franchise would be be left dead and buried Lest they ruin what rubble they\u2019ve left of this once great franchise.  People prone to depression should be warned going into this. This game will Attempt to bring you down and make you feel terrible. you are.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
