Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably one of the most gorgeously directed Star Wars movies I've ever seen. It is also one of the more clumsily written Star Wars films I've ever seen. It has great performances\\, complex ideas\\, and great action scenes. It also has a side story that made the movie feel ten times longer\\, and wastes a potentially awesome character that I want to see more of. Basically there are things I really loved\\, and things I didn't like (hate is too strong of a word). Was I disappointed? Kind of in that I was expecting a little more than I got. Did I have a good time? Absolutely! I don't know exactly where this would fit in my ranking of my favorite Star Wars films\\, but I would say this is definitely in my top 5.","true":true}
