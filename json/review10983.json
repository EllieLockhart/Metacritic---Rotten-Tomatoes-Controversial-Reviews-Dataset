Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having read all the other reviews\\, it is quite apparent that we're all mourning after this dreadful film.\\nI'm a huge Star Wars fan\\, as i'm sure we all are\\, but I wholeheartedly agree that Star Wars died with this movie.\\nHow the \\\"critics\\\" can give this 91% is totally beyond me.\\nI watched it for the 2nd time on DVD last night and was genuinely bored 20 minutes from the end.","true":true}
