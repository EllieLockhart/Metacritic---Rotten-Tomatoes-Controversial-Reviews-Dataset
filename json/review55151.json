Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very impressed by both the Force Awakens (yes I know it recycles elements of A New Hope but once you get past that it's a very good movie) and Rogue One\\, so was really looking forward to this.\\n\\nWhat a disappointment. No plot and what little plot there is has massive plot holes; poor script\\, bad characterisation with a particular disservice to Luke's\\, and humour that mostly misses the mark. I am struggling to find any redeeming features in this movie and just to add I'm not a racist\\, misogynist or a die hard fan that will not accept change. According to some articles you must be one or a combination of the three to not like this movie. This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, it's a bad movie full stop. It feels like Rian Johnson was feeling lazy or lacking any imagination\\, or a combination of the two\\, when he constructed this and I still can't understand how Disney gave this the green light. I wanted someone to bring fresh ideas and perspective to the Star Wars franchise because as much I did like the Force Awakens\\, I was looking for the next movie to take us forward with more original ideas. Obviously Rian Johnson was not the person to do this despite what the critics say.","true":true}
