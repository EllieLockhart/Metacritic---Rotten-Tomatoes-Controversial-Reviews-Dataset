Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of US 2 is the most conflicting game I've ever played. At times I hated it and at times I loved it. I was completely split down the middle. The first game introduced me to two of the most deep and believable characters in any game I've ever played. I couldn't wait to be reintroduced to them again and I was but not in the way I expected. During my first playthrough I was angry\\, confused and heartbroken. I questioned everything about Joel's death and why it was done so fast and so brutally. I almost didn't want to continue after that moment but my care for Ellie kept me going. Playing as Ellie again was refreshing and seeing how much she has developed and grown was interesting. When the narrative switched back to Abby i was upset. I was so angry at this character\\, I wanted her to feel the pain I felt and i knew Ellie felt. I'll be honest playing as Abby didn't change my mind\\, I just wanted to end and see where Ellie ended up\\, but when the game finally concluded I realized something. I realized what the games message was\\, at least what it was to me. Love is blinding. Love makes us do the best and worst of things. My love for Joel and Ellie prevented me from seeing they were just people and just as damaged as Abby. In the world of The Last Of Us everyone has had to cross a moral line to survive and Joel and Ellie are no exception but the love I have for these characters made me biased. Naughty Dog masterfully challenged the players own moral compass in this game by showing how flawed even the main characters are. I've never went so deep in thought over a video game and this is why i appreciate it so much. This game has the most bright of moments and the most dark of moments and ends on a note of mystery. Obviously the visuals are stunning\\, acting is second to none and I wouldn't expect anything less from a Naughty Dog game. I recommend playing the game twice because the first playthrough so emotionally heavy and can effect your perception on all the themes this game is trying to present. I'll end by saying that I'm still torn by the events of The Last Of Us Part 2 but at the same time I'm appreciative of the authentic emotional and realistic connection I have to Joel and Ellie. I really hope there is a third game because I want to Ellie's story continue.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
