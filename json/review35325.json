Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor was completely cringe and almost an insult to the saga. Really stupid plot. People hugging and smiling after hundreds of their friends die... The creators took a dump on our most beloved characters and threw them into the trash. \\n\\nI am a big star wars fan but I actually cant even watch this movie a second time with out getting angry or fall asleep.","true":true}
