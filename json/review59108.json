Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Lets get the obvious part out of the way. Visual\\, sound and acting ... all top tier so there really isn't anything people can complain about in terms of these 3.\r\rGameplay wasn't the highlight of the first game either. It is a very basic action and stealth gameplay\\, with light survival elements. Since this basically the same passable bare-bones gameplay loop with slight tweaks\\, that adds little to none to the experience and is there to fill out the actual gameplay sequences between cutscenes.\r\rNow the bread and butter of the first game was its story. The actual setting wasn't anything new. But the thing is that the setting itself played secondary role to the actual characters. It just served the purpose if instigating events that would lead to Joel and Ellie meeting.\rFrom there on\\, the actual story of a dead world\\, and the possibility of a cure was way overshadowed by the simple but effective dynamic between the two.\rJoel could be the father he never got the chance to be\\, and Ellie finally felt like someone cared for her.\rIt was simple\\, but the small bits of bliss in an otherwise dark world kept people stuck to their screens.\r\rThe Last of Us Part II has almost none of that. It has 2 very short flashback sequences where the charm of the original game got to shine trough\\, but that's all.\rThe Last of Us Part 2 basically boils down to one major shock factor\\, that is showed in fairly early into the game\\, and the rest is a bore-fest of following the uninteresting new character\\, or the bleak revenge story that leads absolutely nowhere.\r\rIt has been said before when the first game was released\\, and sequel emphasizes this\\, but the first game was a wholesome story and experience\\, with a proper ending.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
