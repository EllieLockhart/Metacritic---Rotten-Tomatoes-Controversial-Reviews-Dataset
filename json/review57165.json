Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is pretty much a mix of Phantom Menace and Hardware Wars. What a horribly written movie. The humor in it takes away from the story. It doesn\u2019t develop any characters. It doesn\u2019t align with the Force Awakens and the casting is atrocious. Can Disney just pay up to whatever Christopher Nolan wants so we can get a decent Star Wars?","true":true}
