Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible plot\\, no character development\\, relied on 3D for effect\\, poorly placed\\, over acted jokes...the beginning of the movie made me think of Space Balls. Extremely disappointed with this directors job.","true":true}
