Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the Star Wars community was Alderaan then this film is the Death Star. TLJ turns the franchise on its head\\, and not in a good way. It deconstructs the mythos to a point where it is no longer recognizable. It replaces the literary structure of the monomyth with cheap plot twists and poorly executed gags. Interesting character arcs from TFA are abandoned. Characterization is treated like an afterthought to serve the plot. Where as in the previous films political issues were dealt with at an archetypal level in this film they are presented with little craft or tact making the message ineffective. Where Rian was trying to do something new\\, he ended up making what comes across as a puritan morality play. This film maybe 'pretty' as George Lucas stated but any fan of the lore can quickly see that beneath the facade this is no Star Wars film. The Last Jedi is a box of sugar coated cereal with a Star Wars sticker slapped on the side.","true":true}
