Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A cartoon for children...in live action. Extremely simplistic set ups. No respect for Star Wars norms. Completely invented scenarios that use verbal exposition to establish the new rules of the scene\\, like a round of calvinball.\\n\\nVery disappointing for a life long Star Wars fan. So much potential in these films\\, and instead this is what is offered.","true":true}
