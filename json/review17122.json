Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movies. It\u2019s going to get hated on cause it\u2019s Star Wars and it has its fan base that will just hate anything not original trilogy. It had some flaws; a few slow parts and some overdone comedy. But the battle scenes\\, the twists\\, the images was fantastic. Right now I\u2019m ranking this my 5th favorite Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
