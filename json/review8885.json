{"101487":121885,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2020-04-06","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the record\\, I'm not usually this disappointed by a frachise movie\\, since the movie's exciting big-budget action scenes mostly make up for any plot holes that may have existed in the story. But\\, the Last Jedi\\, for some reason\\, was very disappointing. Not to mention forgettable. You know\\, when I walked out of the theater\\, I basically only remembered fragments of the whole movie\\, and a few hours later\\, I was having problem recollecting even those fragments (that's something very detrimental for a Disney movie\\, is it not?). \\nI think the fundamental problem of this movie\\, above all else\\, was how the movie presented the viewers with more questions when it should have focused on keeping track with its prequel\\, the Force Awakens. So what happens is that the viewer\\, after watching this grand new installment\\, has some issues connecting the movie to the previous ones. And that leads to forgetfulness (especially when the sequel's less intriguing than the prequel). To elaborate\\, what's up with Snoke? In the former movie\\, he was depicted as some mystical Sith lord with powers beyond imagination (well\\, I guess that's why he never showed his true capablities). But in this movie\\, he's just some senile man enveloped in golden robes who does nothing but die in a matter of seconds. What is this? I don't get it. If he trained Kylo Ren\\, shouldn't he\\, at least\\, get some scenes showing off his powers and then die? And what about Captain Phasma? In just a momentary flash\\, she's falling to her doom. If I were to hazard a guess\\, it seems that these antagonisets are being killed on purpose to give more room to some unknown new threat.\\nI get that Rian Johnson wanted to do something different from J.J. Abrams. And he does add some fantastic scenes to the Last Jedi\\, such as Luke teaching Rey the ways of the Force. But he should have paid more attention to that connectivity snag (because\\, if a new episode of a long-lasting series is not connected with the rest\\, like I said\\, it becomes a thorn in the saga's side). Then\\, maybe\\, the movie could have been better.","true":true}
