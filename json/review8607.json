Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time I\u2019ve walked out of a theatre with the feeling that all the air had been sucked out of the room. About 40 minutes too long and multiple instances of the movie destroying the lore behind the universe. If the hope was to just void the events of the OT they could have left the Skywalker saga to end in 89 and started with a new story. Bringing these characters back just to slowly devolve the development of Han Luke and Leia is insulting. The excitement that I left The Force Awakens with for this film is no where to be found for episode 9. ","true":true}
