Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total garbage. This entire movie was a waste of everything. \\n\\nThe plot goes absolutely nowhere\\, the character motivations don't make any sense\\, and Rian Johnson is far too preoccupied with \\\"subverting our expectations\\\" to bother making a good movie. The fact that this movie has a 91% rating (somehow) is the sole reason I created an account on this site... \\n\\nWhether you have never heard of Star Wars\\, or you're the world's biggest Star Wars fan\\, this movie is not worth watching.","true":true}
