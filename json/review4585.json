Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"clunky\\, terrible writing\\,  terrible choices. to much slapstick. the subplots are unnessesary and add nothing to the characters or story.  its just bad. its the first and probably the straw that makes me not care amymore about a franchise i grew up with and love. \\n\\nAlso\\, fuck you Rimjob Johnson\\, Klueless Kathlen Keendy\\,  and PC warrior (only man hating racist hate this movie) Jar Jar Abrahams.  Fuck you. And the horse you rid in on. \\nIm done with star wars. Marvel is now my star wars.","true":true}
