Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's see....the thing most people disliked most about Phantom Menace were on full display here.  Annoying character (Jar Jar Binks)\\, yep but now her name is Rose.  Clunky scenes (pod racing) yes\\, the Canto bight planet.  Bad acting (kid Anakin)\\, you got it...Rose again.\\n\\nIt seems that Disney was so wrapped up in selling their leftist\\, PC agenda that they forgot how to deliver a halfway decent movie.  I left the theater in total disgust and that feeling hasn't left me yet.","true":true}
