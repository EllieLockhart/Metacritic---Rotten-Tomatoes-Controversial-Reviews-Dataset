Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just an awful movie.  I'm so tired of hearing people say I'm just too obsessed with the older movies.  I prefer episodes 1-3 over 7-8 (Rogue One was good though!)\\,  You can't just radically change characters (Luke and Leia in particular)\\, reuse the plots of older movies\\, and ignore Chewbacca almost completely and claim it's a good movie.  If you are going to claim it's for a new generation\\, that's fine\\, but don't steal everything from the old and then give the classic characters an ignominious ending. Disney you are predators and don't care about anything buy money.","true":true}
