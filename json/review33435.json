Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Te most unique Star Wars films to date. Surprising\\, coherent and exciting it keeps you stuck on your seat for its no-so-long two and a half hours. Still\\, Disney has put too many cheesy jokes and scenes which don't fit with Star Wars' tone.","true":true}
