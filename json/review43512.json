Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the worst Star Wars movie ever\\, and is a disgrace. The fact that I could even consider walking out of a Star Wars movie\\, and a half hour in\\, is terrible. Rian Johnson has single handedly delivered the worst of the franchise. The movie was the longest yet because it was filled with so much useless crap\\, including a scene where they only accomplished in freeing some animals\\, just ignore the slave children. Anyone who genuinely likes the movie did not watch the same movie as me because I watched Mary Poppins fly through space\\, and Mary Sue become the greatest Jedi with minimal training. Then of course\\, Snoke\\, and Phasma\\, two characters I really wanted to explore in this movie\\, both got minimal screentime and were killed off as fast as possible. I could elaborate but this movie isn't worth the letters.","true":true}
