Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ret-conned what Lucas\\, Kasdan and Abrams gave us. The Force Awakens\\, generally very well-liked by fans\\, got a very big F-You in nearly every pivotal scene by Rian Johnson. And he can't write female characters.\\n\\nThere was a lot wrong with The Last Jedi. It came off as a montage of TV episodes. Of its too-many sub-plots\\, many were built up then led nowhere. There were heroes with illogical motivations and inexplicable plans and ideas. Perhaps worst of all\\, Rian Johnson writes his female characters two-dimensionally. Holdo\\, Rose\\, and Rey - all were wasted opportunities in this movie to show strong\\, capable female fighters and leaders. Instead\\, Holdo is written as an erratic\\, hyper-secretive shrew.  Rose is written as a lovelorn fangirl desperate for affection. And Rey\\, ostensibly the protagonist of the entire gol-darn trilogy\\, got far less screen time than the real hero of the trilogy was due. One-half star.","true":true}
