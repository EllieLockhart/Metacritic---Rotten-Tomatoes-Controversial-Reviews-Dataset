Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect\\,  it still a solid entry in the series. Beautiful photography and direction\\, but some strange story choices. I would have liked to see more built upon the foundation of the previous film\\, but this entry had a lot to like on its own.","true":true}
