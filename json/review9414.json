Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"God Awful! Excruciatingly bad - if you go into this movie hoping to find - 1)Who Rey's parents are - sorry\\, they're no one!\\n2) Anything at all about the powerful ruler of the galaxy\\, Snoke - sorry again! Nothing!\\n3) Luke training Rey - sorry again - doesn't happen!\\n4) More than 90 seconds of Captain Phasma - sorry!\\n5) Luke even slightly resembling the Luke from the original trilogy - sorry again!\\n6) Luke not dying - super sorry!\\n7) Poe not being a hothead jerk - sorry!\\n8) The movie not completely sucking on historic levels - sorry!!!","true":true}
