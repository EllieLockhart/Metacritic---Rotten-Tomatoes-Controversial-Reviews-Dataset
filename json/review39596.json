Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This follow up to the force awakens left me feeling disappointed after the first viewing. All that the fire awakens lead the audience to believe was important was portrayed as insignificant in the last Jedi. After seeing it the 2nd time with the expectations set aside\\, it was actually a pretty good movie. I feel it will grow on me more and more with each viewing. ","true":true}
