Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all the true star wars fans\\, The last Jedi will be a MAJOR disappointment. What a let down. Sure\\, the cinamatics were incredible\\, the shots stunning\\, and even some farely good acting\\, yet this pales in comparison to the story as a whole. This is why it doesn't work having multiple directors for the same trilogy. PJ did it in LOTR\\, surely it can be done again.\\n\\nIf you grew up watching the original trilogy\\, you will most likely be disgusted at the Disneyfication of this movie. \\n\\nAs far as I'm concerned\\, Star Wars is a 6 movie saga which ended a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
