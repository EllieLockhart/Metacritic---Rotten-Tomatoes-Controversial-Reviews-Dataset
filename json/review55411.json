Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"man\\, this movie just makes your soul feel bad for the lack of care put into a once loved franchise. the things done to these characters have become a meme. It became a breaking news story that main star of the previous trilogy fundamentally disagreed with every step this story took for him... before corporate got involved to have him retract it in order to promote the movie. I agree with Hamil. this movie took subverting expectations to an almost fanatical level. One movie nearly singlehandedly ruined one of the most beloved franchises for both myself and my entire family. That says something. I'm not mad because it didn't do what I wanted it to\\, I'm mad because a majority of this film just doesn't make sense. That's my two cents. I haven't had nor heard of a single positive conversation around this movie. See it maybe just to know what's going on if you plan on sitting down with the next series\\, but if it were up to me....I would rather just watch a YouTube recap rather than have the experience I have had.","true":true}
