Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I managed to avoid all spoilers and reviews but was aware of some bad reviews for this game. I am happy I did as you only get to experience things for the first time once. I finished it yesterday so thought i'd check out reviews on YouTube and Reddit etc and was genuinely surprised at the hate thrown at this game. I'm just a bloke from West Yorkshire so what do i know\\, but I loved it. TheI managed to avoid all spoilers and reviews but was aware of some bad reviews for this game.

I finished it yesterday so thought i'd check out reviews on YouTube and Reddit etc and was genuinely surprised at the hate thrown at this game. I'm just a bloke from West Yorkshire so what do i know\\, but I loved it. The atmosphere created by the music and environment  was tense\\, scary and beautiful. I was moved and hurt by the story. I empathised with most of the character\\, feared Ellie\\, was gut wrenched many times even though I knew I the reason for the heart ache were actions I had carried out hours before. Yes it is a bit long in parts\\,  there were times that i could only play for about an hour before taking a break\\, sometimes this was due to the stress\\, other times it was because I wanted to savor it.\r\rAs a piece of media there is no way this is a 0-5 game. If you play games to get lost in a world\\, forget about your job\\, or to waste some time then you cannot go wrong with it. Thoroughly enjoyable and I can honestly say I feel a bit empty now I am no longer playing it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
