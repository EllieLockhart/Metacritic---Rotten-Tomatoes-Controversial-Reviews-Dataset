Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cenas bonitas\\, decis\u00f5es de roteiro e filmagem estranhas\\, acho que descontinua o primeiro filme da trilogia e decepciona v\u00e1rios f\u00e3s\\, mas n\u00e3o deixa de ser um filme para se curtir com a fam\u00edlia\\, assisti 2 vezes no cinema\\, na primeira me questionei muito sobre as estrat\u00e9gias e o caminho da trama etc etc\\, na segunda eu relaxei e consegui curtir mais\\, mas reparei em mais erros ainda","true":false}
