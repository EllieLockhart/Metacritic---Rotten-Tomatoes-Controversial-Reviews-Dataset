Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. A lot of stuff have been said\\, but I won't ever forgive what they have done to Luke! \\nNo\\, no\\, no\\, and 100 times no! Those people who are saying that it's a new leap in his character development\\, can just blow themselves. I do not want to be rude\\, but just think. He\\, even didn't kill his father\\, Dart Vader\\, who was a menace to the whole galaxy! Luke believed in him. And here is Kylo Ren\\, just a boy\\, his nephew...and you want me to believe that he was even thinking about killing him? No\\, fuck it\\, fuck!","true":true}
