Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the visuals were stunning\\, the story does not flow in the Star Wars universe.  Characters die when it doesn't make sense and this film finishes the work of JJ Abrams and Disney of killing off the history and lore that makes Star Wars what it is.  As illustrated in this film the Star Wars universe is gone and there is no turning back.  Wait for tv release.","true":true}
