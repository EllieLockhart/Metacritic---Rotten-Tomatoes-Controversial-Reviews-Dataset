Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was bad. The choreography was terrible only second to the character's lines. Ships stopped moving from lack of fuel in space. No new characters like Smoke were actually explained or given any backstory. Episode 7 set up a good clean slate for Episode 8 and they just ruined it. This movie was\\, to be simply put\\, terrible.","true":true}
