Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. I've never been so enraptured by a film's storyline - from the tiniest nuances to the overarching themes - and it did it in a way that visually stunning\\, emotionally complex\\, and just...ridiculously cool. I loved The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jedi completely elevated these films for me in a whole new way. I'm really excited about it where they go from here.","true":true}
