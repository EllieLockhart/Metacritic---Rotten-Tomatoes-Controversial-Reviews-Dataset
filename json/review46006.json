Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually my vote is 5 with no problem\\, but I had a lot of trouble to follow and agree with the plot of the movie because\\, for me\\, many actions done by the characters don't reflect their characterization and so their feelings; this last criticism is well summed up by \\\"How it should have ended\\\" Youtube Channel. There are many things about the first and the second movie not told and explained\\, making the understanding of the film confusing and hard to follow. Lastly there are some non-sense scenes which I didn't like\\, making the plot very weak.","true":true}
