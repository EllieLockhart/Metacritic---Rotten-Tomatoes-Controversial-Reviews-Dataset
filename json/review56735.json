Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself was fine (not much better then average). Although\\, it did not feel like a Star Wars movie at all. Where are all the deep plots? Where is the lightsaber battles? Where is the excitement and wonder? The movie did do a good job at making the middle of the trilogy more somber then the beginning movie\\, but what plot is even left for the last movie. I for one would am not 100% interested  in the new characters because they spent such little time respecting and learning from their elders that it's almost illogical. Although i would say this movie is worth a watch\\, it really doesn't earn more then that and leaves me really disipointed in what could have been done and with what is left for the last of this trilogy.","true":true}
