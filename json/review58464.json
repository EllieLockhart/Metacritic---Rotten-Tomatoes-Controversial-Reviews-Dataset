Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost 3 hour film that still contained multiple plot holes. For their budget and talented actors\\, I expected a lot more. one thing I was left with after the first film was multiple exciting questions about new characters and a developing story. However\\, rather than do a explanatory film that eagerly left the audience waiting for the third film we got a bunch of cgi space fights\\, a pointless gambling planet and no backstory on the characters that needed it most.
