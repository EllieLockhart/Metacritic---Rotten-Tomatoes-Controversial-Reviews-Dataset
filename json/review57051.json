Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is pretty good and I really can't understand why so many people doesn't like it. May be for the same reasons why I hated the previous one and all the others loved it. It's quite original and adds new magic to the force. Seriously: we have seen worse things in this saga. Like happy bears defeating the chosen troops of the empire\\, or the federation of squids sacrificing their commercial empire to pursue the goals of a hologram that looks like death. When Empire Strikes Back came out everyone was disappointed of it\\, because of  introducing new things instead of making a copy of the previous one. I hope this film will also be re-evaluated.","true":true}
