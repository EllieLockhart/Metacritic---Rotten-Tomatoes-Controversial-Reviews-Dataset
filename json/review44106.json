Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was a travesty! Worst SW movie yet! The mischaracterization of established characters\\, the lack of story line continuity from George Lucas's original and the squandering and missed opportunities of newly introduced characters from the Force Awakens makes for a bad story\\, weak dialogue\\, inconsistencies\\, and undeveloped characters\\, makes for a lazy\\, unorganized movie that doesn't fit into a movie that's suppose to be part of a bigger trilogy.\\nWeak Sauce!\\n#JakeSkywalker It's a thing!
