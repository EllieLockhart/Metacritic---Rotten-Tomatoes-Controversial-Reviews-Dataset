Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie missed its opportunity to tell the story of what happened to the galaxy after Luke took down the empire. It needed to explore the relationship between Luke and Kylo and show why Kylo joined the dark side despite Luke's best efforts and why he decided that a dictatorship would be best for the galaxy. Instead we are given a movie that has no clear plot\\, no character development\\, no stars vibe\\, no message\\, and is an hour and 30 minutes longer than it should be. The movie's attitude is \\\"you have to like it since it is the new star wars\\\". Walked in the theatre with no exceptions and left disappointed.","true":true}
