Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short this movie sucks. This was not Luke Skywalker. The old characters I like were not respected. The new ones that were introduced great in force awakens were crapped on in this movie. They were all out of character. I have no desire to watch episode 9 because of this movie. Also because of this movie I have no desire to watch the force awakens again. Maybe Disney learns from this and will do other trilogy's right. Maybe keeping a director for 3 movies. That might help. Can't bring back dead characters. Too late on that. Gosh they ruined Luke Skywalker in this. I mark this trilogy as NOT CANNON.","true":true}
