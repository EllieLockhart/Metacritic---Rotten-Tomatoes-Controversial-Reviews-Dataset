Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a brush or individualism and\/or progressive intention\\, Rian Johnson either blatanly disregards or proceeds in utter ignorance of the wealth and consistency of star wars film that precede him. An entertaining film if it exists in a vacuum\\, a tragedy of disrespect and missed opportunity as a piece of the star wars continuum.","true":true}
