Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even if it was a movie to be rated by it's own merits (standalone and within the sequels trilogy) it's plot is a massive mess. It betrays it's own principles (in-saga\\, in-trilogy and specially more baffling\\, in-movie. I'm looking at you\\, \\\"its okay to suicide to save everyone\\\" Holdo\\, \\\"but its not okay to suicide to save everyone\\\" Rose\\, all within minutes.)\\n\\nIt feels like a deliberate stab to the star wars franchise and it's characters\\, and if the people still in PTSD staring in disbelief opened their eyes and stopped siding with those that basically just wanted to tear the franchise down out of spite\\, this abominable charade of hate sugarcoated as a simple cashgrab would be over already.","true":true}
