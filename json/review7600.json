Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything great about Luke Skywalker has been violated. Instead we get a broken coward who doesn't care about anyone. Rey doesn't need lightsaber training from anyone still. And this movie felt the need to show you that the female characters were amazing and the male characters were broken\\, cowardly or hot headed. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy has killed Star Wars","true":true}
