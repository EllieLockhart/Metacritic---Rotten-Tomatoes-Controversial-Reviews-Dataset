Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously movie was trash. So many wasted plot lines movie sagged through the middle. Snoke and Rey identities as hyped as it was is pretty much non existent. No lightsaber fight at all. Disney just pushing a movie for women blacks and foreigners by specific casting. Luke is supposedly a pussy now OMG LEIA USES FORCE POWERS BY....FLOATING THRU SPACE....that sentence should sum the validity of the movie right there. Least JJs Force awakens was a remake n he admitted it this is just a downright throwaway","true":true}
