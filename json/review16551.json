Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a word awful. Its almost painful to watch that's how bad I feel this film is. The special effects are as good as you'd demand in a SW film. However a story lines with the plots\\, the scenes and the set ups which turn out to be either dead ends\\, pointless\\, stupid or caused me to wonder wtf was that all for then. In fact after the Leia Poppins moment I'm sure the person next to me heard me exclaim WTF ! and I lost interest quite rapidly there after as it descended into more nonsense. Has R Johnson ever seen are SW film ? Does he have any idea of the universe that had been created ? Because if this is the best he can come up with he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near anything to do with SW again. \\n\\nIf I was the head of any of the Disney departments to do with this and I'd been shown this as the finished article the company had sunk millions into I'd have been raging. In fact so  irate I'd have pulled it as I couldn't have brought myself to release it. 30+ years this story line held my interest and this drivel almost finished it in the first hour of this film.
