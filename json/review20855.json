Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 7 years old when A New Hope came out. All the joy and excitement I felt back then are now matched with disappointment. This movie is horrible. I could write a better story than this trash and I don't have a shred of writing experience. So disappointing. ","true":true}
