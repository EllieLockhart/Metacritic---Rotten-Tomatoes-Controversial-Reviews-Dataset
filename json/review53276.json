Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly the worst Star Wars film ever!!  The story is officially dead.  The box office is going to continue to go down for this movie and I would be surprised to see anywhere near the same number of people attend Episode 9.  Rian Johnson should never\\, ever be let near the Star Wars universe again.  Oh wait\\, they just signed him up for a new Star Wars trilogy.  Good luck getting anyone to go see that.\\n\\nWe now see that the movie critics are worthless.  Clearly they have been paid off\\, blackmailed or both\\, by Disney.  There is no other explanation as to why all of the critics think this is somehow a good movie especially in the context of the Star Wars story and universe.  They completely butchered the story.  In fact there is no story any more.  They completely discarded everything in Episode 7 and left us with nothing to anticipate in Episode 9.  I don't have any desire to see Episode 9.  I wanted to see Episode 8 to see how the story progressed but Rian Johnson just stomped on everything that I and everyone else wanted to know.\\n\\nTo anyone who has not yet seen this movie\\, don't waste your time.  It is THAT bad.","true":true}
