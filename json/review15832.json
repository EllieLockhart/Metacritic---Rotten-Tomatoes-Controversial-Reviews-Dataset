Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars. Hearing the soundtrack was enough to get me hyped. Unlike many people\\, I am enjoying and loving the new movies. They may not have the same feeling of the old ones\\, but the universe continues and its nice to see that it's kept alive. I loved how they used a puppet Yoda instead of CGI to remind us of his interactions with Luke. \\n\\nFRESH","true":true}
