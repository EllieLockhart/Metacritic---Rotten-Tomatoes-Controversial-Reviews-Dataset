Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Missed opportunity. This is more of a political propaganda film rather than a Star Wars movie. Everything JJ Abrams set out to do in the TFA is obviously undermined and destroyed in this movie.........it'll be a long time before I see another on these films in the theater.","true":true}
