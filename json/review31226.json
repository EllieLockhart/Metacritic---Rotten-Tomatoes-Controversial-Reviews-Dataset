Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes\\, sub stories that added nothing the the movie\\, unbalance of comedy and drama\\, in-continuity with TFA\\, waste\/destruction of interesting and memorable characters\\, bad acting from probably good actors\\, and many\\, many more. What is now one of the low points for the franchise.","true":true}
