Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know that this film has split the Star Wars community and fandom almost straight down the middle\\, but I fall into the group who loved it. I still felt like I was watching a Star Wars film\\, but it's approach was unique\\, and the questions that it posed were thought provoking. I'm giving it 5 full Stars\\, and it's moved into my #2 spot in the Star Wars Saga\\, right behind the 'Empire Strikes Back'.","true":true}
