Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, first of all understand that The Last Jedi is an absolute solid sequel and entry to both the entire Star Wars franchise and the Skywalker Saga. As a big legends guy\\, I felt nervous after hearing and reading other people's reviews of this film... Especially after TFA (which I thought was GOOD\\, but not absolutely amazing) and that VIII would really need to kick things into a proper gear and move things into fresh uncharted territory... This film does exactly that; and it does it differently and oddly well. This is a brand new chapter that pushes and tests all the characters we've come to know and love. The humor isn't forced like some would have you believe- it's real and carries a relatable personality for the film itself. And everything is handled with creativity and care. I'm excited to see where the story takes us in IX. \\n\\nKeep in mind when reading negative reviews; that this movie indeed takes some risks and does some bold moves. But so did our beloved ESB back in the day... And a lot of people weren't happy about that film when it came out either; but over the years it's looked at as one of the best Star Wars films of all time. The Last Jedi will have that same impact in the years to come!","true":true}
