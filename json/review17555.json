Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I simply can not give this movie a higher rating due to some issues\\, The plot holes were quite confusing\\, They added horrible characters\\, such as Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) for an extended amount of time in the movie and had high profile characters such as Admiral Ackbar die in an instant without any kind of recognition\\, The killing of this character really shows a lack of understanding for the audience and the effect of a new director who has a different view for how the series will proceed. There were a few moments that caught my eye and made me say \\\"Wow\\, That's cool\\\" But there was only a few instances were I would have said that. This movie was a failure to the original actors of the franchise and a slap in the face to the fans.","true":true}
