Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a decent chapter in the saga - people are freaking out\\, saying that Rian Johnson completely upended the franchise\\, and that he \\\"really changed it too much!\\\" Give me a break\\, it's still a Star Wars movie. No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans.","true":true}
