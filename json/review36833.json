Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie theater was packed and you could feel the hype. Everybody started cheering once the movie crawl started.  At the end of the movie you heard dead silence from the crowd. No Cheering no nothing. Did not like the character arcs and no new interesting characters that star wars is known for. When a porg is one of your most interesting characters the film has a problem.","true":true}
