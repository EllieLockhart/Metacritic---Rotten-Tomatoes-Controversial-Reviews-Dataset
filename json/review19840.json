Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was awesome! Anyone crying for the old characters should rewatch the old ones again\\, they were great but we are all moving on. You kids love it\\, we love it and you should recognize it too. Amazing!","true":true}
