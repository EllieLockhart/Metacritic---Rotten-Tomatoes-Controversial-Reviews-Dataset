Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film\\, destroyed everything that was the original trilogy\\, and ruined Luke Skywalkers Character. Anyone who loved episodes 4\\, 5 and 6\\, don't watch this movie\\, I don't even want to consider this movie trilogy they are making as canon anymore. \\n\\nThere were many other terrible subplots and things that just don't make sense in the Star Wars movie\\, but I'm not one to post spoilers.","true":true}
