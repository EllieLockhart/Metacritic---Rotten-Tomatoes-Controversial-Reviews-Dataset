Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute slap in the face.  This movie ruined Star Wars.  I guess the Mickey Mouse in South Park is valid.  Who cares what the fans like\\, we just want their money.  Well\\, Star Wars is dead to me. There are no redeeming characters left\\, all the ones that survived have no substance. The reasons any of them exist as they are is laughable.  Worst movie of all the Star Wars movies and I'm content saying that this movie is not canon\\, the Luke Skywalker that was in the first movies still lives there. Mark Hamil tried to warn us.  I hope all Star Wars fans boycott the next movie\\, maybe we can have some justice on how dirty this movie was by forcing them to make another reboot; Disney can take a page from Marvel-they own both companies after all.","true":true}
