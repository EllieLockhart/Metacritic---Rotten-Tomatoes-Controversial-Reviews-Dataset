Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT!\\n\\nQuestions\\, plot holes\\, and *whoops*\\, killing off the Jedi Master before finishing the story for movie three? \\n\\nThank you Disney and Abrahams\\, for making Rey the last Jedi (master) who has had absolutely ZERO training and no explanation for how she knows ANYTHING about using force powers.  Thank your for ensuring that all of Rey's time on the Jedi Planet amounted to less that 16 hours real time but was able to encompass several days or even a week in Luke Skywalker time.  Thank you for giving us hope that Ren and Rey were siblings\\, which would at least explain her force strength and give some credibility to the idea that maybe Luke Skywalker guided her combat skills in movie one\\, only to tell us that she is nothing but a piece of white trash from white trash parents whose force ability is a complete fluke.  And thank you for killing of Luke\\, only to end up losing our princess as well\\, leaving moving three with absolutely NONE of the three original heroes (aside from using Luke's ghost which will be able to do absolutely nothing but talk...).  Oh\\, and thank you for brining Yoda in for 4 minutes of dialog making it seem like the farmboy never really learned anything about being a teacher at all.  \\n\\nYou have all failed us... worse than Lucas with Jar Jar Binks and Natalie Portman's weak attempt at being a strong female sci fi lead.","true":true}
