Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars film\\, it's a Disney movie with a SW skin on it. All its problems are in the script\\, in how the legacy of the previous seven movies is handled: everything set in episode VII is gone to waste\\, and this is BAD if you era building an epic. From a technical point of view the movie is very well crafted\\, with great shots. But it's filled with plot holes\\, irritating dialogues and lots of jokes. Not interested in seeing the next one\\,","true":true}
