The amount of detail that was in the games levels were one of the most detailed I have seen in some time especially within this current generation of games. The physics of the foliage overgrowing on buildings to blood trails in the snow made the players character feel more attached to provide that immserive experience along with the detailed spacial sound incorporated within it. Another great part to highlight is the combat system and how that incorporates itself within the games levels made the players experience feel more unique as your finished sometimes incorpated smashing enemies through windows or using objects within close proximity to finish them off.\r\rNow I've got the positives out of the way here are some of the negatives in which I think had impacted the game alot and have caused me to give the score I have given. Having one of the main protagonists die by one of the players characters made an intense and powerful story but unfortunately the execution of the killers character felt forced upon and that majority of the story with Abby feels as though Naughty Dog are trying to push you for sympathy of her actions and because a large portion of the game is played by her kind of takes away what the whole story should have been about. From what I can see it looks as though many changes were made throughout the development which then causes the game to feel rushed in some parts which is quite disappointing as there was great potential there.\r\rOverall its not a bad game but don't go in there playing it with high expectations as you may be disappointed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
