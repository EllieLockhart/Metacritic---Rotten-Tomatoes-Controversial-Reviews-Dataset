Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me write my first review ever and no I am not an alt-right troll or bot. Adam Driver and John Boyega are bright spots. Though I liked Rey i. TFA and I think Daisy does a good job\\, they make her way too powerful for having only recently discovered the force. Rose as a character does not make sense to the story. Lastly\\, what Rian Johnson and Disney did to the legacy of Luke Skywalker is nothing short of a cinema travesty. I hope the JJ Abrams can salvage what he started and we can forget this movie ever happened. I award this movie one star and may god have mercy on your souls. ","true":true}
