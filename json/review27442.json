Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over 41 years ago\\, I caught the first StarWars movie. It was a magical escape from reality\\, an epic space opera that took place in a galaxy far\\, far away a very long time ago. This past weekend I caught this movie on Netflix. This is a very mediocre and unnecessary movie\\, which essentially took a whole bunch of stuff from the original trilogy and cooked it up for fanboys who can't get enough of StarWars and those who are addicted to epic space operas. The actors and characters were tiresome and tedious. The story limped along\\, much like the chase scene that dominated the entire movie and I couldn't see any major plot to this movie\\, except for a warmed over rehash of Kylo Ren asking Rey to join him in ruling the universe. Sound familiar? Yeah\\, stolen right out of the Empire Strikes back when Vader reveals himself to be Luke's father and asks him to join him in defeating the emperor and ruling the galaxy as father and son. Yeah. This movie was a rehash of all the old tropes from the original trilogy. The one gem in the movie was Laura Dern\\, who plays Admiral Holdo and performs the ultimate act of sacrifice to save the handful of rebels. This was a very \\\"meh\\\" type of movie.","true":true}
