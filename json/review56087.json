Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some people are saying fans are reacting negatively only because they can't handle the expansion of the SW story. That ain't the issue. Every SW episode is\\, in some way or another\\, an expansion of the previous episodes. This particular episode is problematic because they are dispensing with the fundamental elements of SW -- the Skywalker family\\, lightsaber battles\\, the Jedi vs. Sith narrative\\, any conceivable limits on use of the Force\\, the absence of self-aware humor. At some point\\, it really isn't SW any more -- it's more like Marvel or Harry Potter.\\n\\nI believe time will eventually tell with respect to the Disney SW films. SW didn't become what it is today merely by telling conventional stories and offering cookie-cutter narratives that fit within the popular discourse of the day. It did so by creating a rigorous mythology\\, an alternate universe with a distinct set of rules\\, civilizations\\, history\\, and culture that seduced and captured the interest of its audience. People aren't drawn in by conventional quips like \\\"we fight because we love our friends\\, not because we hate enemies\\\" and other bullshit like that. If I wanted that\\, I'd flip on Oprah or Dr. Phil.\\n\\nI'm sure the new SW film probably appealed to a wider set of viewers -- particularly\\, females -- than previous SW films. Thing is though\\, I doubt this is really the sort of thing females will fall passionately in love with\\, the way males fell passionately in love with the original SW trilogy. It's only a matter of time\\, IMO\\, before Disney starts to see profits drop\\, and the omnipotent $ starts to exert its corrective effect.","true":true}
