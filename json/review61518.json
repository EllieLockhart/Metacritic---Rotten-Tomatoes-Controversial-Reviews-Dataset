Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is an excellent game from the technical perspective\\, with awesome gameplay\\, graphics and soundtrack.

I cannot criticize the directions it takes\\, rather the execution and a certain sense of disrespect for some characters that deserved way better. Hope this review helps players get the general idea of what this game is. If you are looking for a survival horror game that challenges you in the gameplay department and not caring at all of the story\\, this is a game you may enjoy. If you are someone that prefers storytelling over gameplay\\, chances are you wont enjoy this game as I did.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
