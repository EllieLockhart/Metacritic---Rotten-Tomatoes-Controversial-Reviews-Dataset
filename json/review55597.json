Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not going to buy this movie cause seeing it once was enough. Why is it so hard in this age to make interesting characters and not write plot holes the size of caverns? I thought the Force Awakens set up a great dynamic between Rey\\, Poe and Fin. There was this mysterious evil in the name of supreme leader snoke and a search for Luke Skywalker that  was worth risking lives for.  Turns out Luke is sitting in a cave drinking alien cow-milk full of regrets but he shows up in the end to say goodbye to the franchise in a BS way. There's so much wrong with the characters in this movie that could've been great. And the plot twists are just awful in this movie. In the end...It's a visually entertaining movie so watch it..with no expectations whatsoever.","true":true}
