Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some flaws\\, but overall a really enjoyable film.  I really enjoyed the totally unexpected\\, but heart-wrenching take on a conflicted Luke who seemed lost in the sum total of his mistakes and afraid of his own legacy.  I will watch it again and recommend it to anyone who is not floating around in EU romanticism.","true":true}
