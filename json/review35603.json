Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is a good Star Wars movie but not a great or amazing Star Wars movie. It's not near as bad as fanboys say it is. The special-effects are amazing and the action scenes are fun and exciting. There's a few things in the movie that don't quite make sense and the middle subplot at the casino things do slow down. It's not the best Star Wars movie out there and not as good as the force awakens but still good entry to the series.","true":true}
