Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi looked great\\, but the story was so poorly crafted the script wouldn't have survived the first round of a screenplay contest. Cliffhangers from \\\"Force Awakens\\\" were routinely ignored or openly disrepected. And speaking of disrespect\\, Luke Skywalker was stripped of everything that made him an iconic character in the first place\\, and disposed of in the end like stale leftovers.","true":true}
