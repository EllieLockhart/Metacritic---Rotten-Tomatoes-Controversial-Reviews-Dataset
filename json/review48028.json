Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not terrible\\, Last Jedi did a very poor job of following up The Force Awakens.   After 2.5 hours\\, The Last Jedi rolls credits and deflates the momentum which had been generated by the previous film.   \\n\\nIn many ways\\, I enjoyed Last Jedi\\, but it also frustrated me.  It frustrated me because there are a few points when it feels like the Star Wars movie I wanted\\, but then those moments are quickly washed away by odd storytelling choices and a seemingly hostile attitude toward any and all of what Star Wars had been prior to the film.   Despite enjoying the film\\, I cannot say that I felt it delivered Tyne experience I wanted\\, and I do not feel confident in the future quality of the franchise.","true":true}
