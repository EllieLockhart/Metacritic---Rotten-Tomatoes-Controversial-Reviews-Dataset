Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Think about it\\, this movie takes place 18 hours following the last movie. In last movie Finn couldn't fly\\, now he is suddenly\\, with no training\\, is an expert pilot. They are chased at light speed with First Order firing on their shields\\, yet Finn\/Rose can take a trip to a planet for several hours and then magically return to the ship\\, still being chased and blasted on by the First Order. Nothing in this movie made sense\\, and they trashed Luke's character\\, angered and spurned away the fans.","true":true}
