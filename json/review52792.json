Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long time fan\\, I grew up devouring expanded universe novels and comics. I feel like this film has realised everything I would want from a new SW film. Unpredictable\\, great characters\\, good acting\\, pathos\\, humour\\, and lots of genuinely exciting action. I thought The Force Awakens was pretty good but worried it was a bit repetitive of old themes and ideas. This film allayed those worries and has me excited for more!","true":true}
