Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed TFA and thought it set up TLJ well with many themes\\, plots\\, and characters to be explored. I am disappointed in TLJ for not exploring any of these and instead destroying them all. There was no continuity between this movie and the first and any new themes that were brought up were not very obvious due to clustered storyline. It leaves me wondering if the obliteration of all of these storylines in TLJ will lead to more shocking twists in the final episode of this trilogy. Positives of this movie are good scenery and Yoda","true":true}
