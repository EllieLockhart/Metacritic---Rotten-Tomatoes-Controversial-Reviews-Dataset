Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was floored by the scope\\, warmth\\, humor\\, and intensity of the story.  The fight scenes and the special effects are spectacular!  My third favorite installment of Star Wars movies after Episode IV and Episode V.  Go see it!","true":true}
