Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS FOR LAST JEDI : \\n\\nLook i'm not a director but i know a lot of things about star wars\\, Generally the movie is fine but there is a lot of things left us hanging!\\, for example Supreme leader snoke died without telling us who he is\\, if he is a new character at least give us a backstory for him \\, and how you guys confirm thar snoke more powerful than vader and palpatine without showing us his true power! \\nU basically killed him without showing us his powers and and a backstory\\, but the way he  died is a brilliant but not in the middle of the movie that SUCKS!\\, lets talk about rey\\, a young girl with this kind of power with the force WITHOUT TRAINING must have a relative who is strong with the force so the fans can buy it\\, I KNOW the force surround every living thing but not on rey! You can make it on the little guy in the ending\\, but rey was at the same age as luke in episode 5 and yoda refused to train him because he was OLD! But yoda and obi wan knew that he is strong with the force and his dad is VADER\\, rey must have a relative who is strong with the force! \\nKylo ren Is not a SKYWALKER !!!!!! He is a SOLO his mom is skywalker ! \\nAnd the purple headed why did she not tel poe her plans! If she did fin and rose never went to the casino in the first place \\, \\nThat jump that she did with the ship to destroy the first order ship is one of the amazing things i ever saw\\, And about luke and his new force power is great but he should look like the way he is! Not in his old look with his blue lightsaber the 15 minute ago was destroyed! \\nAfter watching the last jedi i lost hope for episode 9 and i really dont know WHATS going to happen and i think is going to be MEH like this one\\, here you go i get  it out of my chest!","true":true}
