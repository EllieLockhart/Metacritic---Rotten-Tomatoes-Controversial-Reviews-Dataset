They are pointless. In the first 2 hours of the game\\, Naughty Dog managed to ruin what was once an amazing franchise\/storyline. The character development was just so freaking weak. The disappointment was just beyond what my brain can comprehend. Next\\, because they decided to kill off Joel (whoever wrote the storyline needs to be fired ASAP) is just mind-boggling. Fans did not wait like what 7? 8? years for such a poorly written storyline to be presented to use. It truly felt like such a slap to the face. I tried so hard to push through and finish the game (I did) but the disappointment was just... The ONLY positive thing I have to say about this whole game was the graphics. That's it... The Last of Us was the type of game focus on the storyline. That's what made fans fall in love with the game in the first place. The storyline and character development. It is so sad that so many nasty reviews have been written for this game because it truly had so much potential. overall I am just so mad at Naughty Dog for presenting such a **** game to fans and making us wait so long to be able to play it only to charge an arm and a leg for a piece of poop of game. Shameful of these greedy creators. You definitely lost a fan due to your sad excuse for a storyline in The. Last of Us Part ll.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
