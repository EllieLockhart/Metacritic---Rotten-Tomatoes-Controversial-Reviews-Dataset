Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Star Wars trilogy (eps 4-6) is the most average & overrated trilogy of films I have or will ever witness in my life.such bad story telling and so many plot holes it\u0092s a joke.last Jedi could have been the most perfectly made Star Wars movie & there would still be those same sad cunts who are so in love with the first trilogy they would criticise it and say it\u0092s a bad movie for the sake of it.get out of George Lucas arsehole & learn to enjoy yourselves you pathetic cunts!","true":true}
