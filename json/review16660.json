Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly long\\, drawn out and boring. This movie is just filled with political propaganda\\, and was basically just used as a stage for Disney\\, the director and writers to push their political agenda on the audience. Awful plot filled with holes\\, and way too many side stories that have nothing to do with anything. This movie makes the prequels look like cinematic gold\\, DO NOT waste your time or money on this flaming pile of garbage\\, that boils down to nothing more than a slap in the face to Star Wars fans. This movie has filled my heart with hate for Rian Johnson\\, Disney\\, Daisey Ridley\\, and Adam Driver. Pure\\, burning\\, HATRED!","true":true}
