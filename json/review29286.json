Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reys story in this movie was exceptional. Finns story was pointless. But all in all I\u2019d say this movie might be better than the Force Awakens. Not sure they\u2019re about the same in love neither is amazing but the last Jedi Has some Luke so there\u2019s that.","true":true}
