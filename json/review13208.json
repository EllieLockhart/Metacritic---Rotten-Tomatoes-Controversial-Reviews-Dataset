Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand all of the negativity. I am in my 40s and grew up with star wars. That said\\, times and audiences change. Sure\\, there were cheesy moments and missed character opportunities. However\\, I was entertained. The effects were great and I love the new cast of characters we saw more of. It was a fun movie. Mission accomplished. ","true":true}
