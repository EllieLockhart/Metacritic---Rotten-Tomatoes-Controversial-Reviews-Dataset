Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw something very special this afternoon. I cheered\\, I clapped\\, I did a jig. I teared up\\, I sniffled\\, I mourned and my heart soared. This took me back to my first experience\\, back 40 years. I saw the original 138 times\\, I will see this 139 times.","true":true}
