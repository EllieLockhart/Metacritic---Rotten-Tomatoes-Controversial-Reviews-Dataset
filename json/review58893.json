So\\, other than the one comment from Troy\\, I was going in blind.\r\rSurprisingly\\, when the game started off I didn't have any issues with it. However\\, it soon became apparent that Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann had a scratch to itch with this game's story\\, characters be damned.\r\rNeil has gone to Twitter and said that they won't pander to the fans of the original game\\, which is fine. Tell the story that you want to tell. If you want to tell a dark story\\, then do so creatively. If you want to take these characters on a journey into the pits of hell\\, then do so creatively. If you want to discuss how revenge makes monsters of us all\\, then do so creatively. What you don't do\\, is give us this story that is so amateurish in its execution that it was genuinely a chore to slog through.\r\rIt's almost as if ND engineered this story from the end and worked their way backwards. How do I get the characters here? Oh\\, well this has to happen and that has to happen regardless of whether it makes any sense or not. The plot should serve the characters not the other way around. This is why you have multiple characters behave in uncharacteristic ways just so ND can get to where they want to go with their story.\r\rThis same story could be told\\, even with all of its issues\\, in a much better fashion. How is it that the last game came out in 2013 and this is the best that they could do? This game's story drags the whole game down. I actually wanted the game to just end when I got to the farm. This wasn't because I thought that would be a good way to end the game. I simply wanted the game to end because I didn't care anymore. As a storyteller\\, I'm sure that's the last thing you want\\, but as a gamer I can tell you what I don't want: The Last of Us Part III. Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann made sure of that.\r\rI really wanted to like this game. The first game was amazing\\, a 10\/10 experience. I am by no mean a professional reviewer but even by my standards 10\/10 scores are extremely rare.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
