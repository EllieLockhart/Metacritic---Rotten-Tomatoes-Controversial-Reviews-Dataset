Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, Luke is a failure\\, and parents aren't important. The boy who has a mother\\, father and uncle who love him\\, becomes the most evil person in the galaxy and is not worth saving\\, from his families perspective. And the one who's parents sold her for drinking money is their savior. \\nSnoke\\, Phasma\\, the Unknown Regions\\, all of the amazing lore created since Disney took over has been flushed down the toilet.","true":true}
