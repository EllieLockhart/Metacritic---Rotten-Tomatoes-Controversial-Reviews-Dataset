Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every serious moment is spoiled by slapstick humor or really bad timing. This makes it nearly impossible to care for the characters The Force Awakens tried so hard to make us care about.\\nLike the scene with Rey handing the lightsaber to Luke. There was two years worth of buildup to it\\, and they literally dropped it. It was funny for about 5 seconds\\, but it stung. It was like\\n\\n\\\"Hey\\, remember all we built up with the previous movie?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yeah?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Trash it. This is a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie now.\\\"\\n\\nEvery setting\\, aside from the casino\\, has already been utilized in previous Star Wars movies. Once again\\, Disney plays it safe with the setting\\, failing to innovate.\\nMost of the conflict in the movie emanates from deliberate misunderstandings or lack of crucial communication between characters. (I'm looking at you\\, Holdo.)\\nHalf of the movie is focused on a completely unimportant subplot and an unlikeable new character. \\nThey ruined Poe's character by turning him into a two-dimensional hot headed pretty boy.\\nThey undo every mystery that was brought up in The Force Awakens in the most anticlimactic fashion.\\nLaura Dern and Benicio Del Toro's characters served no purpose and felt shoehorned into the story. The war economy motif Del Toro's character played into was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story\\, and just made him look like a forgettable attempt at making a new Lando Calrissian.\\nThe Empire Strikes Back callbacks were poorly done. While The Force Awakens tastefully imitated A New Hope's narrative structure\\, this one felt like a parody.\\nThe little furry chicken things are an even more blatant marketing ploy than the Ewoks. They serve no purpose other than to sell toys. \\n \\n\\nOn the bright side\\, the main plot with Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke was mostly ok. The dialogue between them was pretty cringeworthy\\, though. This is most obvious during the \\\"Force Skype Call\\\" sequences.\\nThe movie makes a big deal about Kylo Ren's role in the First Order\\, and how turning him from the dark side could turn the tide of the war. This is very confusing\\, as he is shown to be completely incompetent within his rank among the baddies. It's hard to see how he could help the alliance in any way. \\nThe action in the last part of the movie was good. The sequence in (not)Hoth was pretty good\\, save for when that one character does something completely unnecessary and ruins what would've been an emotional scene.\\n\\nThe movie turns Supreme Leader Snoke\\, who was theorized by many to be some important sinister figure in the Star Wars mythos\\, into a flat throwaway villain. His only purpose is to give Kylo Ren more daddy issues. That's it!\\n\\nOverall\\, it's an entertaining movie if you're looking for cheap laughs\\, but an awful sequel not worthy of the Star Wars title.  \\n\\nOh and one more thing. Disney\\, please stop focusing so much of the marketing on Captain Phasma if she only has 2 minutes of screentime. You've done this twice already.","true":true}
