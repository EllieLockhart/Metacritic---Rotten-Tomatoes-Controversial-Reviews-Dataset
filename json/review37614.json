Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no way the critic review is correct this movie has a lot of issues and was not good at all.\\nI mean there were a few great scenes that can stand alone but the movie was awful.","true":true}
