Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seeing this movie gave me some thrills in the moment. But the moment the credits rolled I was just left feeling empty.\\n\\nI never got to see Luke doing something cool\\, and because of how the movie ended I never will. Even worse\\, the Luke we saw in this movie was the antithesis of the Luke I knew from the older movies.\\n\\nI was not left with any reason to care for the new characters. And I was not left with any reason to fear the only villain who is still standing. \\n\\nI'm just left with disinterest. The old characters didn't do anything exciting and the new ones just aren't interesting. \\nSince I'm not curious in the slightest about what is going to happen in the future movies\\, this is probably the last Star Wars movie that I am going to watch.","true":true}
