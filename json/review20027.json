Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was horrible. Because it was Star Wars\\, it was even worse. Zero strategic or tactical reality. The universe was clearly shaped around intended character development with no effort to have the characters fit into a 40 year old fantasy universe.","true":true}
