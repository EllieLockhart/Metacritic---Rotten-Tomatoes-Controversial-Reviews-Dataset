Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an exquisite Star Wars film\\, made for the fans who've been there from the beginning and know the stories emotionally\\, intellectually and spiritually. The Last Jedi\\, like any great Star Wars film has humor (\\\"I know\\\") and pathos (\\\"No\\, I am your father\\\")\\, a fast paced intercut story with enough slower moments to build tension along the way\\, great character growth\\, some surprises and even deaths of a few of them (Oh no! Vader just killed Obi-Wan\/Alec Guiness... WHAT?!). The addition of a bunch of great new creatures\\, planets\\, ships\\,  scoundrels and heroes was a better than typical and welcome bonus.\\n\\nThere will always be the pathetic\\, cranky\\, whiners who want to take a Bantha poojoo all over a Star Wars film\\, because some people just plain suck and have an agenda and some just gotta hate what most of us love. Sucks to be you\\, haters. I've gone twice and am going to go many times more. Merry Christmas to all my fellow true Star Wars fans. $500 million and counting after five days! Yeehaw!","true":true}
