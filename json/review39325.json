Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an abomination to everything that star wars has been.  Awkward forced comedy that does not fit\\, meaningless characters that get killed for no reason and never used to progress anything. The film does nothing to progress into episode 9. This film lost me on any hope for the future of ep 9.","true":true}
