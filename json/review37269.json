Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The performances were good.  The actors did the best with the material given to them.  On the whole this movie is a massive disappointment.  I waited 30 years to see Luke Skywalker on the big screen again.  Now I wish I could unlearn what I learned.","true":true}
