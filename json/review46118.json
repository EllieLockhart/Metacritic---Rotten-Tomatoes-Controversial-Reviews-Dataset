Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"visually\\, the movie is still amazing. but... the story was weak. The characters un-reliable and I didn't really care what will happen to them. the action scenes were predictable and the twists were silly and forced. Bottom line\\, It was a truly badly written movie. one that made me not care what will happen to the characters in the next chapter. deep deep disappointment.","true":true}
