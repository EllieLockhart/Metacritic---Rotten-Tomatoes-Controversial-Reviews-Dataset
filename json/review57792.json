Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals and acting was good and that is where my praise ends. Apparently Disney with all their money and power can't manage to write an acceptable script. While I won't hate on anyone for enjoying this film\\, nobody objective can say it's a good one. It has tone deaf comedy that breaks tension and immersion\\, it has a convoluted and boring plot\\, it has poor character arcs with zero development as well as ignoring previously developed characters motivations and breaks existing lore. On top of that it ignores or tosses out questions and expectations the previous movie worked hard to set up. It literally does not feel like a Star Wars movie. I can see the direction they wanted to go but everything was implemented so horribly on so many levels and went in so many directions they ended up creating a disaster. I consider myself a casual Star Wars fan but I find it impressive how much they could make me dislike a series that I previously had some hope for. Needless to say they broke this franchise and I will not be seeing future installments.","true":true}
