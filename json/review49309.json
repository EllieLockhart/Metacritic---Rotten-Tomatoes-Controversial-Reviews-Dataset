Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie there is\\, I would rather watch AOTC. I am looking forward to see Ivan Ortega's edit though. He might be able to make it a decent film by the looks of it.","true":true}
