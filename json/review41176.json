Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has made me clinically depressed. Luke's character is completely perverted going from saving his genocidal father from evil to attempting to murder his nephew in his sleep.  General Leia demoting fighter pilots for downing a Star Destroyer (but...isn't she the GENERAL) and you'll get to watch the old Rebellion interstellar fleet you grew up with get destroyed one by one because this is a feminists admiral's brilliant plan she won't tell anyone about. And 95% of the Resistance is wiped out as predicted by evil men pilots.","true":true}
