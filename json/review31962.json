Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead. Came out of the cinema 2 months ago\\, my main criticisms at the time\\, were:  \\n\\n      Diabolical 'comedy'. \\n\\n      The bad guys are truly pathetic individuals. Never did I think what a joke Vader\/Emperor\/Tarkin were\\, they were serious characters. Gleeson was miscast as Hux\\, too young\\, too meek.\\n\\n     Leia should have died\\, seeing her floating there I thought 'goodbye Carrie\\, RIP' but then she opened her eyes!\\n\\n     Thought I was watching a Harry Potter scene while they were riding 'horses' around outside and inside the Casino. BB8 is ridiculous\\, as is Finn and Rose's sense.\\n\\n      Disney hypocrisy\\, criticising capitalism\\, days after announcing $52B purchase of 20th Century Fox!\\n\\n      Daisy Ridley's character (can't remember her name atm\\, says it all) attacking Luke on the island. \\n\\n     Poor old Luke.\\n\\n     Didn't like what they did with Poe\/Chewie\/Finn.\\n\\n     Chewie should have eaten the Porg\\, now that would have actually been funny.\\n\\nStupid character actions throughout\\, ie. why didn't Laura Dern's character simply explain her plan to Poe\\, which was a bad one regardless. Even\\, after hearing the plan Poe should and could have thought this is bad plan\\, and tried to devise something better\\, not necessarily mutiny. Why is Rey sympathising (attracted?) with Kylo\\, when days ago in the films timeline he tortured her\\, murdered his father\\, and numerous others?\\n\\n     But\\, the biggest logic flaw was the light speed destruction of the imperial fleet\\, which effectively made every film made before and after pointless. If this was possible\\, why didn't they fly one of the several capital ships that supposedly ran out of fuel before into the imperial fleet. Or why didn't they build capital ships\\, and simply program them to fly as light speed torpedoes at Death Stars\/Star Destroyers\/whatever. This single scene breaks the entire Star Wars universe.\\n\\n     There were of course many other things wrong with the film\\, but these were my own immediate criticisms afterwards. Several times they almost got me back\\, and it was good in parts\\, it was exciting to see Luke face down Kylo\\, but turns out he wasn't even there\\, so to me at least it made his demise pointless\\, when it could have been heroic.\\n\\nJarJar Abrams and Rian Johnson continue to blame bad reviews on sexism or racism. They don't seem to understand the criticism of Rose is not to do with her ethnicity\\, but the character she portrays. Same with Daisy Ridley's character\\, Rey\\, she is too powerful given it was only a week ago in the films timeline she was scavenging on 'Tattooine' world\\, not because she is female.\\n\\nI could go on. Disappointed. The critic score is astounding\\, clearly Rey has used jedi mind trick on many of them\\, you'd think reviews would be more mixed like the audience score. I have read that a score of 1\/2 or less does not get counted to RT.","true":true}
