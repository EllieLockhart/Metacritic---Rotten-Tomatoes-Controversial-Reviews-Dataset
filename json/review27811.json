Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personal i don't think its amazing nor is it terrible. One of the largest draw backs is it supporting cast\\, especially the new additions to the movie. Another problem is the creative tone changed due to the change of direct\\, this is very apparent in the first scene which continues on from the end of the previous movie. \\nover all still a better film than 'The Force Awakens'.","true":true}
