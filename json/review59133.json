I\u2019ve played games that had **** graphics and gameplay yet came back more satisfied than this disappointment. If you can\u2019t get players to be invested with the story and world created then graphics and gameplay mechanics don\u2019t mean anything. Better playing the first Last of Us game. Not worth the 60 dollars better getting it on sale for 20 or used at 25-30.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
