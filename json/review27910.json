Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plain and simply a horrible movie. Pointless plot\\, terrible character development\\, horrible motifs\\, and simply not a fun movie. The only people I can imagine likely this is SJW\\, purple headed lesbians\\, younger audiences that like shiny things with no substance\\, and those who can't discern between a good and bad story. Skip it. It's not worth the price of a rental.","true":true}
