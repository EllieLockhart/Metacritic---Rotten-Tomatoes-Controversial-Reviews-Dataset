Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was completely and utterly disappointed with this movie. The choices that were made were either not \u201cStar Wars\u201d\\, didn\u2019t make sense\\, and\/or weren\u2019t needed for the story. There were so many continuity issues. For instance when bombs are dropped in space they sink..... yes because there\u2019s gravity in space. Another example\\, how do Finn and Rose know the rest of the rebels are leaving in the transports and why do they tell the sketchy \u201cdecoder\u201d? Captain Phasma was useless. She was apparently a worse fighter than Finn who was a janitor in the last movie. They made Snoke to be important and then they killed him in 5 minutes. As is he couldn\u2019t see Kylo\u2019s intentions. I really could go on and on but who has the time. I really didn\u2019t like this movie. Because of that I\u2019m scared to watch episode 9. Disney is great and all\\, but they ruined Star Wars. #NotMyStarWars","true":true}
