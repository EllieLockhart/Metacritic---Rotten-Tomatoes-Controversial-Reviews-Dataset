Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi's only accomplishment was the visual effects. The movie failed to deliver a story with substance. The stroy relied too much in deus ex machina\\, ignored the rule of checkov's gun\\, and crippled potentially good scenes with ill-placed bad humor. Worse yet\\, it mocked the legend and mythos of Star Wars and discarded characters that needed more screen time.","true":true}
