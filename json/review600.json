This is the best interactive experience I have ever had with a video game.  People will say \\\"Its just a movie\\\"\\, well trust me folks no movie will ever be able to match the immersion you are able to experience with Until Dawn.  Sure it's clich\u00e9d and cheesy at times\\, but that was done on purpose.I don't care who you are or what kind of games you are into... You need to play this game!

Sure it's clich\u00e9d and cheesy at times\\, but that was done on purpose.  I've never been a fan of horror movies especially the cabin in the woods style dumb teenager horror movies\\, but that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of this game!  I can't tell you how many times I made a decision that I immediately regretted because of the tension created by this game\\, but that just made me want to go back and replay those parts as soon as I finished the game.  There is no way this game should get lower than an 8 or 9 score from anyone\\, but as for me this game gets a 10!  No amount of knit-picking can get me to deduct any points from this game.  Also my wife never plays or watches me play games and she watched me play this game from start to finish and loved it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
