Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was super hyped\\, bought some tickets for Saturday with some friends and then went to see it today\\, alone. Basically couldn't wait. \\nLeft the cinema halfway through. Before deciding to do that I mocked some of the bad user reviews with my girlfriend\\, thinking that it's unwarranted. Little did i know. The movie starts with some of the worst and most contrived scenes I've ever seen. And then carries on on the same note. It feels like a bad quality fan film on a really big budget.\\nShit. I wonder how many critics disney paid off so that it could have that critic score... \\nWill probably pirate the next one just so i see how shit it is and not encourage this kind of cheap film making. The second part of the hobbit is a masterpiece compared to this. Almost as bad as suicide squad.","true":true}
