Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out with the old and in with the new.  Star Wars cannot truly be great again until they spread out the movies universe and stop centering everything around the Skywalker family line.  I thought this was a good way to get rid of most of the old resistance and bring in new and introduce new characters.","true":true}
