Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see this movie with my roommates and I was really not too happy with it. The visual effects were amazing\\, seeing as Disney had more money than God at this point that's only fitting. The acting was\\, with several major exceptions\\, fairly good. But the writing\\, pacing\\, and even the overarching plot were downright awful.\\nThe only part of this movie that I truly enjoyed was seeing the look on Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) face when he saw his trusty droid companion R2 again for the first time. The rest of it was just absolutely awful. Wouldn't recommend.","true":true}
