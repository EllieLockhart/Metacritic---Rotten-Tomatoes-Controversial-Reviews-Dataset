Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forced SJW nonsense\\, loads of mcguffins\\, and whole story arcs that go nowhere.  So sad after The Force Awakens was so good.\\n\\nEdit: adjusted score down after considering this movie against other Star Wars films.  This is by far the worst Star Wars film to date\\, and I'm including the Christmas Special.","true":true}
