Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I go to the movies to get away from politics and other points of view that people try to push on me. I want a story that takes me to another place for a couple of hours. This movie is horrible I will not be giving Disney any more of my money.","true":true}
