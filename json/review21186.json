Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very underwhelmed and disappointed after the first time I watched The Last Jedi on opening night.  I found much of the film to feel like an insult and to be ridiculous.  However\\, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars (and I already had tickets for Saturday afternoon) so I rewatched the movie 2 days later and felt profoundly different afterward.  And I'm not alone\\, this happened with two other close friends who are also superfans and felt very disappointed after the first viewing of the movie.  I think at the end of the day my expectations were exceedingly high and this movie goes in directions I just wasn't able to appreciate at first.  But when I knew what to expect from the movie I was better able to appreciate\\, understand and even like the direction the film took.  I can't promise that everyone who didn't like it at first will like it after a 2nd viewing\\, but I'm at least glad I could come away really liking this movie.","true":true}
