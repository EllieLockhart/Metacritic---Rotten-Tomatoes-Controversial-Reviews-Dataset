The same characters from the first game\\, which were previously so well realized and developed\\, are written and thrown away so poorly here that it is an absolute slap in the face to the most hardcore fans. The graphics and gameplay\\, while certainly competent and at times truly breathtaking are mostly undermined by just how incompetent the story is presented and told. The game truly became an endurance test of annoyance to play through\\, as I was forced to continue through scenarios which I quickly lost interest in\\, and didn't care about said characters the game was trying so desperately hard to get me to sympathize with.\r\rI was originally debating on giving this game a balanced score of a 5 but the ridiculous self indulgent\\, supposedly profound ending the writers have decided to incorporate here\\, falls flat on it's face and sealed my final score to a 4.\r\rOn a slight side note - Marketing for this game has completely mislead and flat out lied to people and it is absolutely baffling to me that major video game reporting outlets (that have given this game a masterpiece rating) have refused to even point that out\\, when they have done so with other games they themselves have reviewed. Trailers were deliberately altered to give the illusion that characters play a larger role than they actually do. A major character was purposefully hidden for...whatever reason. Writers came forward and stated that you wouldn't be forced to kill dogs\\, (this could be only a minor spoiler) this was completely untrue! And finally\\, certain characters were made to look older when in reality\\, in the final product they were actually younger as it was taken from the perspective of flashbacks. Ridiculous! Manipulative and shady marketing at it's absolute peak!\r\rDo not buy this game if you were a huge fan of the first. These developers do not deserve your money if this is the level of storytelling they had to show after 7 years of waiting! A sequel never should have happened! I wish I had never played it! I'm heartbroken. I keep expecting to wake up and this game to be a bad dream\\, but it isn't and now I don't want to speak of it ever again!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
