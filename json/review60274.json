The Last of Us 2 brings an extraordinary story\\, with well built characters\\, an impressive narrative and the most realistic graphics I\u2019ve ever seen! After finally finishing the story of the game\\, to me it was clear: this game was not made for fans! Many people thought that TLOU 2 would have an ending that was as exciting and emotionally intensive as the first one... however that didn\u2019t happen! That is why many players were disappointed: although the story is complex and awesome\\, it may not have ended in an expected way for most of us. Here is my opinion about the game: 1. NARRATIVE Very different from what happened in the Last of Us 1\\, the second game is more focused on \u201cthe limits of humans sanity at an apocalypse\u201d. And they definitely made it!NaughtyDogs has created a game that makes you question yourself all the time: what would you do if you were that character and why does that character act that way? It makes you wear their shoes and experience the consequences of their actions during the story. You never know which is the right side\\, until you realize there is no right side in an apocalypse!It is a complex story of revenge\\, and how hard it is to deal with ourselves and the others at an apocalypse. It plays with our emotions and thoughts in a fascinating way! The characters are very well constructed and that makes an enormous difference during the narrative. 2. GRAPHICSAbout the graphics\\, it is just unimaginable! It brings an impressive variety of details\\, with a great color selection and very realistic characters. About that\\, nobody can disagree. 3. GAMEPLAY The gameplay is even better than at the first one! TLOU 2 brings wider spaces for exploration\\, more realistic actions and antagonists\\, new weapons and infected levels\\, and much more. 4. CHARACTERS When it comes to the characterization\\, I\u2019m honestly very satisfied! They\u2019ve constructed very expressive and complex characters\\, fact that has everything to do with how the story is built and how it ends. So that\u2019s it! The Last Us 2 definitely has brought a lesson to many people\\, its ending teaches us a lot about how rev... ops!! Guess you\u2019re going to have to play it to find out! Hope you liked the review!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
