Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the cinema broken \\, was a conflit of emotions but bad ones\\, very good acting\\, worst\\, script ever\\, no connection between scenes \\, \\,Finn and Rose story is just waste of time\\, Rey super overpowered\\, leia flying in space like a witch\\,  snoke died without knowing who the fukk he came from\\,  and the Luke skywalker story is a insult to the caracter and fans.now i know what Hamill try to say....i left the teatre defeated without hope of seeing another star wars movie...","true":true}
