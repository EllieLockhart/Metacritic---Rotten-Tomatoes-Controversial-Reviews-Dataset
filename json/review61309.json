We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"no idea how the metascore can include so many 100\/100 ratings... the game continues with the classic\\, loveable tlou aesthetic\\, mechanic and movement system we all loved so much\\, but quickly turned into a mess of a game through losing itself in too many character plots\\, time changes and forced feelings about these aspects. in no way\\, shape or form could the loyal fan base and lovers of tlou1 ever consider liking abby to the same degree that we love\/loved ellie and joel. the game is a real disappointment and insult to those that cared and the purity of these characters. joel\\, killed off instantly. ellie\\, changed into a political statement about naughty dogs acceptable of gay\/lesbian relationships. the very essence of joel was spread throughout the game in flash backs\\, to make players miss him and find out more about him\\, when\\, in my opinion\\, he was used to re-grasp player attention after playing a character they didn\u2019t care about for so long. joel is debatably my favourite video game character ever. and those flash backs were my favourite part of the game\\, returning to what made tlou1 so great. raw emotion and attachment through a character\\, by choice\\, and through development\\, through the softening of himself\\, through the real energy and love that he brought to all his scenes. comparing him to abby can never be done\\, as she was seen by others as a brutal killer\\, coined by mel as a horrible person\\, and continually considered that by players regardless of her small deeds to redeem herself. the game touched on so many things that didn\u2019t get enough screen time jackson - 1 scene\\, if that isaac - 2 scenes\\, after being hyped up for so long santa barbara - \u20182 levels\u2019 tacked on the seraphite prophet - killed instantly when the two run always enter the game so many themes that deserved more time\\, but instead focused on a completely screwed love story about abby and owen\\, that no one cared about.... i wish i loved this game and i could continue\\, but i really wish that joel and ellie\u2019s characters were treated with more care and respect. if this game was never released\\, i would be far happier\\, having a pure and faultless remembrance of these characters\\, forever being my favourites ever.. but alas\\, they were dragged through a shameful mess of vengeance\\, split timelines\\, plots with limited memorable scenes. my favourite parts included most ellie levels\\, the wlf truck scene and predominantly the joel flash backs. rest in peace joel and ellie\\, you will both be remembered for part 1.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
