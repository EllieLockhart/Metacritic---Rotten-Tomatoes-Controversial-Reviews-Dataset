Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge letdown. The plot and timeline made no sense and worst of all it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. On top of this\\, there was no payoff for any questions which were created in TFA\\, but rather the filmmakers almost said FU to the audience. This made the film even worse since you had no sense of individuals true motives. Additionally\\, all the characters came off as childish\\, which was partially due to the excessive amount of forced humor during what should have been tense moments. In addition to these childish antics\\, the filmmakers also decided to add personality flaws to every character which took away from the time during which the plot should have been further developed. Finally\\, the lack of plot development and character growth not only ruined this movie\\, but it will also make whatever resolution is planned for the next movie feel rushed and underdeveloped. Nothing like killing two birds with one stone.","true":true}
