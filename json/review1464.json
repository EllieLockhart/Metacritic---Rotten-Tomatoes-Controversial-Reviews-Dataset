Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan who saw the originals as a child and teenager\\, I was hopeful by the initial twitter and critic reviews but as I watched it; I became disappointed with the final product.  I am wondering why we have to kill off the original trilogy characters because to make way with these characters.  Star Wars is a Skywalker story.  I would have hoped to see episode IX with an older Luke killing off Ben.  Nobody will expect the older person to win.  Also\\, Revenge of the Sith has the best light saber battle still.  Some stuff was just too unbelievable as part of having the force; i.e. surviving deep space cold\\, communicating across the galaxy and generating an image of yourself.  My order from best to worse is Empire\\, The Last Hope\\, Rogue One\\, Return of the Jedi\\, Revenge of the Sith\\, Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi\\, Clone and then Phantom Menance.","true":true}
