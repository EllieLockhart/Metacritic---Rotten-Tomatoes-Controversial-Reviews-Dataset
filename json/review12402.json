Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I brought both my kids to watch this. My 6 year old boy wanted to leave after 30 minutes and my 11 year old daughter HATED this film as much as the Emoji movie. \\n\\nThis film has destroyed star wars for two generations - well done Disney as I can guarantee there is no way I can make my kids go to the next one (they where just about okay with Rouge One). The franchise will die with my generation but not outlive us (I will give it 5-10 years on the current trajectory and the next film will bomb)\\n\\nIt could have been awesome cut to around 1hr 40\\n\\nA piece of advice for parents  - take your kids to watch jumanji instead.\\n\\nP.S Every person I have talked to who liked it will outright say it was too long.","true":true}
