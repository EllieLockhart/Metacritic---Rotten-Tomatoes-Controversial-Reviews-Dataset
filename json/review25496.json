Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"--no spoiler-- \\nDoes not deserve the brand! Worst. Star Wars. Ever. \\n\\nThe plot didn't only have HOLES but BLACK HOLES that sucked into them any possibility of ANYTHING interesting in the next movie. All the questions from the last one were answer in THE most BORING way possible. No theories to debate till the next movie\\, noc cliffhangers to keep the energy going. Just a load of \\\"eat your peas.\\\"\\n\\nThe writers obviously don't believe in heroism\\, relationships\\, character development or logical consistency. None of the characters were likable except maybe Rose\\, who had no reason to exist and was very confusing.  Almost ALL of the major decisions were made for plot-service rather than logic or character motivation.\\n\\nAnd Ray continues to be a stupid Mary Sue who's internal struggle doesn't seem to be connected to anything and search for a teacher doesn't seem to have any purpose at all since she can just immediately out perform everyone ever. --sigh-- yay feminism. Bland\\, arch-less over-powered female characters that will make every little girl using Ray as a role-model who *can't* do everything perfectly on the first try feel like a failure. Really solid job there.","true":true}
