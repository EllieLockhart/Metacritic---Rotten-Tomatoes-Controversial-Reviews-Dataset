Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything negative has already been said. I've watched it just now for the first time since I saw it since it's release. It's a much much prettier movie than I remember\\, and being prepared for the...choice....turns that the movie goes into makes it easier to ride with. However\\, it's still garbage\\, the flying superman bit is still jarring\\, Poe is annoying\\, Finn is idiotic and Rey is too OP. If star wars was a football team it'd be the Cleveland browns.","true":true}
