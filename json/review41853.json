Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible. It is hands down the worst Star Wars movie ever made. The story is horrible\\, Rey is still a Mary Sue\\, Rian Johnson does not understand Luke Skywalker\\, and fight scene in the throne room is poorly choreographed. This film was so bad it actually pissed me off\\, something few movies\\, no matter how bad\\, have been able to do. The people claiming this is a masterpiece have no idea what they are talking about. If you want to watch a Star Wars film with your family\\, DO NOT watch this. Even the prequels at their worst were never as bad as this. This was my first Ryan Johnson film\\, and after seeing it I can safely say I never want to see any more of his work.","true":true}
