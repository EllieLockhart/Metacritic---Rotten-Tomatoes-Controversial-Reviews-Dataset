Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I clicked not interested because I didn't think the film deserved even a half star. I share some similar concerns as others but I want to add something.  One of the things I look for in a film is emotional realism. Ok so we have Finn and Rose running down to get \\\"help\\\" in order to disable the tracking system. Poe has to mutiny to do it. Long story short\\, this decision leads to the deaths of countless rebels and obliterates the rebels abilities to counter attack effectively. After Luke sacrifices himself\\, the left over few are seen on the Falcon\\, patting themselves on the back with all smiles\\, as if though they are at a birthday party. No remorse from Finn or Poe. No emotional realism at all from the few remaining rebels after this big loss of life. Apparently the writer has never been in a war or read war stories. They did manage to free some alien horses. Without emotional realism even sci fi stories fall short.","true":true}
