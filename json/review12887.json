Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't particularly like TFA (mostly because of Rey\\, but other elements as well). But I didn't think it was too bad considering that ep VIII might explain some things. And explain them it did\\, in a way that just screams lazy screenwriting to me. Rey continues to be a massive Mary Sue\\, and even more so than in TFA. Poe is shown as an idiot even though all of the actions he took were the correct ones. And purple hair lady (I do not remember her name) is not just one of the worst movie characters I have ever seen\\, but also the worst admiral to have ever existed. Luke died in an extremely unsatisfactory way\\, and there wasn't a single lightsaber duel in the entire movie. And then there's Snoke\\, who for being so incredibly powerful sure seems like a nobody. Nothing about him is explained. \\nBasically TFA was bad\\, but it could have been redeemed and explained in this movie. It wasn't\\, not even in the slightest. I feel bad for JJ because of what he has to clean up now. None of his plot points were even remotely addressed by Rian Johnson and the movie is just a huge disappointment overall. The only good thing about it are the special effects\\, but that is to be expected of Star Wars\\, so they don't get any extra score for that.","true":true}
