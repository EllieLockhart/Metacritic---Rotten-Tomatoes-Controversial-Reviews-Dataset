Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disjointed\\, confused\\, painful\\, ridiculous\\, silly\\, immature\\, failure. The most impressive thing about this movie is how they managed to screw up what should have been one of the easiest slam dunks in movie-history. 2 stars for great special effects and a few parts of the final 20 minutes.","true":true}
