Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So f****** Horrible.  The Force Awakens\\, even though it had several flaws\\, was a nice reboot of the series.  However\\, The Last Jedi massacred Star Wars.  I'm not just saying this because i\\\"m cynical; this movie was total crap.  It didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie.  Yes\\, there were wookies and all the things in the Star Wars universe but it never captured the magic its predecessors had.  Say what you will about the prequels\\, but without those\\, we wouldn't have great characters like Darth Maul or Dooku.  And of course the prequels weren't as good as the original three but they still were authentic and felt completely within that universe.  This movie reeked of sellout and hollywood agenda.  And I can see why the movie critics liked it because if you throw certain elements into a movie none of the reviewers have the balls to say it's crap because they are afraid to piss off certain groups in this country.  I loved Star Wars more than anything.  Timothy Zahn and other writers have kept that magic that George started alive and created so many great memories that I cherish.  Rian took those memories and sold out to Disney.  That's all the movie series is now--a cash crop  For me the series ended with Return of the Jedi.  I could go into meticulatious detials of why this movie truly sucked but I think if you've ever seen a Star Wars movie before you know already.","true":true}
