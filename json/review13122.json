Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know where to begin\\, but I'll sum up the problems with this observation: it's apparent that priority 1 was to ALWAYS surprise the audience by doing the least expected\\, and priority 2 was to add lots of laughs.  These overshadowed the film so much that character consistency and continuity with things like what can be done with the Force and how technologies like hyperspace work were compromised.  So were all the story threads set up by TFA.  All other saga films are in the genre of \\\"space opera\\\" hearkening back to the old 30's serials. This move was an action comedy like \\\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\\".  Switching style and basically rebooting the film in the second trilogy are bad enough\\, but the utter disrespect for the established characters is too much.  The worst part is that casual fans and critics are giving it high marks\\, because if you know nothing about Star Wars lore\\, symbolism\\, ties to Eastern philosophies\\, and general cinematic style than it seems entertaining.  As such though it's a terrible terrible Star Wars film.","true":true}
