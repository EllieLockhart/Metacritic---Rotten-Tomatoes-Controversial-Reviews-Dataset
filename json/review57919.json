Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible movie.  Left me wondering what I just saw.  Nothing about the story felt like Star Wars.  Was just a long car chase in space with characters making really dumb decisions.  Nothing made sense.  Destroyed everything set up by the Force Awakens.  Makes me not care about episode 9.","true":true}
