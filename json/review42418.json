Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was actually incredible! it was so well done! I have no idea why it doesn't have a much\\, much higher user rating! the plot was extremely captivating\\, it was thoughtful and beautifully shot. it paid respect to the original films quite nicely\\, but was still new and exciting! People say it's too long but\\, I was so happy it kept going! Really excellent film\\, the critics got it right\\, the user's got it wrong this time.","true":true}
