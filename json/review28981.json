Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed the continuation of the saga. Nice wrap-up of old characters and continuation of newer ones and introduction of even newer than those. As usual\\, the special effects continue to awe and improve. Went as 3 generation family: grandparents\\, parents and grandchildren (youngest being 8). All liked.","true":true}
