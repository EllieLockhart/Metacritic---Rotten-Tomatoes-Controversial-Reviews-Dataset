Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has ruined Star Wars. The film casually tosses away the most beloved character of the entire franchise like a piece of trash which is an unforgivable betrayal by Disney to the fan base.  The film has no real plot\\, the dialogue sounds staged and unrealistic. Most of the film focusea on a side mission like a RPG that doesn't even move the plot along. As in The Force Awakens\\, Fin isn't used for anything more than the \\\"token black guy\\\" which is a terrible shame. Both Kylo and Rey are cheesy and unbelievable despite Ridley and Driver performing very well. Snoke was tossed away easily and to no effect or  emotional gravity which completely negates his ever being included  in the franchise to begin with.  Much like Luke Skywalker has been casually tossed away with no fanfare or emotional weight. The only bright spot to this film is the excellent special effects\\, the superb acting performances of Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. I genuinely feel I've been not only cheated out of my time and the cost of the ticket\\, but have also had a beloved part of my childhood ruined and insulted. Disney has just spit in the face of Star Wars fans everywhere. I will not be seeing ANY of the future SW films!","true":true}
