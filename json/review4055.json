Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Breaks the laws of physics\\, people basically breathing in space on a ship that has a massive whole under it while in SPACE! and no just because it's fictional doesn't mean they can just do all that\\, it's breaking its own laws of physics it's setup\\, this movie is a logic twisting abomination\\, it breaks the logic that the movies have been building for the last 40 years\\, it's okay to have things in the movies that aren't real in the real world but it needs to have a limit\\, you don't see machine guns in medieval movies and things like that\\, if a movie like lord of the rings had people running around with machine guns and rocket launchers it's breaking it's own logic\\, and there's plenty more to hate about this movie\\, almost completely stopped liking Star Wars.","true":true}
