Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"George Lucas has his revenge now that Rian Johnson has made the worst Star Wars film of all time.\\n\\nAfter the prequels were completed\\, George Lucas refused to make another Star Wars film. The fans were upset about the CG in the film and upset that George Lucas felt that Jar Jar Binks was a great character - the fans thought Jar Jar was annoying. After seeing The Last Jedi\\, however\\, I only have one thing to say\\, \\\"George Lucas\\, you are forgiven.\\\"  \\n\\nIt is only fitting that George Lucas has his revenge and make his hero's journey triumphant to Star Wars and that the fans are more upset with Rian Johnson who was given almost full artistic control of the script mess that is The Last Jedi.\\n\\nAfter viewing The Last Jedi I felt like quoting Ben Kenobi\\, \\\"I sensed as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.\\\" It's also as if a fandom was upset if only slightly because it is the greatest franchise in history\\, and it seemed like the script was written by a man who is not a Star Wars fan.\\n\\nThe script is what I feel to be the biggest problem with the film. The character 'modification' of Luke\\, everyone's favorite Jedi is unnecessary to advance the plot. In this 'exciting' script\\, Luke goes against the Jedi way and apparently tries to kill Leia's defenseless child and later is reduced to a weak old geezer who's daily chore is to milk an alien space cow for greenish milk so that he could drink it in a glamorous way like the Got Milk commercials so that the audience would think its 'funny'. Let me tell you something Rian\\, having the greatest Jedi of all time drink green milk in a glamorous way is not 'funny' lol. Actually\\, I'm laughing that it will probably be the highlight of the film and should have been in the trailer\\, but I do find this lack of character continuity disturbing. Another problem is that Chewy is a morbid porg killer which also seems unnecessary to advance the plot and out of character\\, eating the cute pets that live in the Millenium Falcon. All of these story elements just don't seem very Disney\\, tho they bought the Star Wars Franchise and they do have the right to totally mess up Star Wars if they desire\\, which I am sure is their complete diabolical vision for Star Wars. \\n\\nPerhaps most interesting of my theatre experience of watching The Last Jedi wasn't on screen\\, but it was something I've never seen before. A man was on his cell phone the entire time in the theatre and nobody said anything. He left halfway thru but then came back for some reason just to surf on his cellphone during the movie. Its as if he didn't want to leave but also didn't want to partially miss the movie while looking up from his cellphone every 15 minutes. I am surprised no one said anything to him about his cell phone during the film but now I empathize with him and I'm sure the whole audience understands now what he understood then. This film is an entire snooze-fest.","true":true}
