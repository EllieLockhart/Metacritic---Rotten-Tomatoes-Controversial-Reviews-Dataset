Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never write reviews\\, good or bad. I actually have to this time. I love the star wars franchise. I still love star wars\\, but not this so called movie. Rogue one was amazing even\\, but Disney slaughtered this movie. So disappointing.","true":true}
