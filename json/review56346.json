Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible character writing\\, unimmersive universe (not Star Wars like at all)\\, horrible fight scenes. More plot holes than I can count\\, total disregard for continu\u00efty....would make for a good sci-fi action if it was called \\\"Ninja Space Warriors\\\" or something\\, but not worthy of the title \\\"Star Wars\\\".","true":true}
