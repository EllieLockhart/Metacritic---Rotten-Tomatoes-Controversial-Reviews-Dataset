Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was bored watching this movie. It never drew me into it's story telling despite it's breakneck pacing & amazing visuals as it never developed despite 2 1\/2 hours run time. My biggest frustration was that by the end of the movie i felt as though i do not know what can be accomplished to end this trilogy satisfactorily and make it feel as though i have experienced a true beginning\\, middle and end of a journey during this trilogy. Sad to say i do not really think of what could be in the next movie\\, and currently would not care if i saw it or not. I just do not care what happens to those people left in the Star Wars universe as they are so 2 dimensional. This series seems so completely disjointed from the events of episode 4-6 that it is more like a movie series set in a similar universe with minor cameos to remind us that it is the same.","true":true}
