Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably a fine movie for the new\\, younger fan.  But for a traditionalist who saw Empire back when it was in theaters\\, this movie was a colossal disappointment.  Especially considering the excitement many of us held leading up to the release.  But in all\\, this movie all but affirms there really isn't any REAL Star Wars movie w\/o George Lucas' involvement.  But nonetheless\\, just quite sad to see the legacy take this turn.","true":true}
