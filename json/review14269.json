Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the haters. Johnson tried to give SW a much needed injection of fresh blood\\, whilst also drawing in elements of the sadly sidelined \\\"Legends\\\" aspect of the Extended Universe. Whilst there are flaws with the film (the Canto Bight subplot could've been cut *wayyyy* down without hurting Del Toro's role)\\, the tepid\\, course-correcting\\, \\\"fan\\\"-fearing Rise Of Skywalker shows just how dull it can be to cling so closely to past episodes. TLJ justly takes its place alongside Empire and Rogue One as series highlights.","true":true}
