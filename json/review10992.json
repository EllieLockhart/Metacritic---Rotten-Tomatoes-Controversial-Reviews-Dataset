Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having watched the entire SW saga\\, this one is my favorite! TLJ has a distinct form of storytelling and cinematography compared to the others that I absolutely love. It brought Mark Hamill's acting abilities to a new level. I absolutely adore this movie's complex and powerful Luke. Both Luke Skywalker and Ben Solo delivered impressive character depth and development that made me love their characters when neither was of interest to me before. However\\, the true star of this movie was the Force itself\\, we got to learn a lot of what it was and what it can do. My only issue with this film is the actress who played Rose; she was neither good nor bad\\, her bland and angry incorporation of Rose was subpar at best. Nevertheless\\, RJ created a beautiful and memorable movie filled with many other intriguing new characters\\, without depending on SW fan nostalgia. He did well expanding on the concept of the Gray Side\\, rather than focus on Light vs Dark Side. Not to mention\\, all the fight and action scenes are truly phenomenal! It is a shame that RJ wasn't in charge of last episode. I wanted to see his vision for episode IX that reflects and develops what happened in episode VIII.","true":true}
