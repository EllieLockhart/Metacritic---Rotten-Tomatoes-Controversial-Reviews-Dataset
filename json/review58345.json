Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disturbing tangent in the Star Wars saga.  This movie is an unfortunate mistake in every capacity.  It generated tons of expectations and met none of them.  It tried desperately to take the story into bold new arenas only to give the middle finger to the stories that came before it.  Take away the mind boggling departure from the Star wars universe and it's still a poorly written movie with sub plots that make no sense and underdeveloped characters that could have brought so much more to the telling if allowed.  Bad\\, bad movie.  Terrible Star Wars movie.","true":true}
