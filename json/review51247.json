Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely pandering to the rabid SJW crowds\\, stealing nearly everything it has from the OT and what they did add were \\\"subversions\\\" that ultimately hurt the movie more than it helped\\, assassinated Luke's character\\, made Leia Mary Poppin's her way back to the ship after being blasted into SPACE\\, a completely useless plot that meant nothing involving Poe\\, Finn\\, and worse-than-Jar Jar Rose\\, Ma-Rey Sue Mary Sueing her way to victory without any logic aside from just being that good\\, and many inconsistencies and bullshit not worthy of its legacy. This movie is the Mega Man X7 of Star Wars\\, the Sonic '06\\, the The Last Airbender of the series. What have they done?","true":true}
