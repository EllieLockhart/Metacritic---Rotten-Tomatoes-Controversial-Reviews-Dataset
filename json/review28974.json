Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed it! Had a few pacing issues\\, but other than that it was great.  All the whining over Luke is silly and unfounded. It's almost like they want Luke to be a Mary Sue....","true":true}
