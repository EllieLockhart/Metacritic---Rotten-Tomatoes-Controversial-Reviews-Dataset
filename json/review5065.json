Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created a rotten tomatoes account just to give TLJ the negative review it deserves. Complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker\\, and a flagrant\\, irresponsible disregard for the mythology that Lucas created I was left heartbroken. \\n\\nI wasn't in love with TFA\\, but i liked it enough to root for this trilogy to be good. Now in my book Star Wars goes back to ending after VI.","true":true}
