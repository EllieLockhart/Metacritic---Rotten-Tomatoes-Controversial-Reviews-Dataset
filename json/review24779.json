Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much respect to Mark Hamill for being the one honest voice in Hollywood.\\nHe tried to warn me this was crap... he was telling the truth.","true":true}
