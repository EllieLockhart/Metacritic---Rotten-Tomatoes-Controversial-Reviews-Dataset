Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me wrong\\, This movie is phenomenal when it comes to keeping the audience entertained and as a movie alone it'd get 5\/5 for the fantastic set pieces utilized and beautiful scenes; such as the silence added to create atmosphere to a certain stunning scene for example. However\\, as a Starwars film it should follow the rules of the established law and should of utilized certain characters more than others\\, this is a good film but a bad addition to the Starwars saga.","true":true}
