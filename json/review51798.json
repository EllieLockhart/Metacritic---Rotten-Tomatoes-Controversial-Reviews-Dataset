Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aesthetically beautiful\\, but the plot left much to be desired.\\nIt feels very different in tone to Rogue One and The Force Awakens\\, and it answers almost none of the questions raised in the last mentioned satisfactorily.  \\n\\nOverall\\, the shallow dialogue and the extremely conspicuous family movie tropes make the reasons for Mark Hamill's dissaproval very apparent to any old Star Wars fan with two brain cells to rub together. It's clear Disney has decided to ditch the old timers in favor of grooming a new generation of moviegoers\\, which is understandable from a business perspective\\, but it makes the callbacks to the old movies feel like a mockery. \\n\\nI wish children and pre-teens like and embrace this saga as I did when I was their age\\, because this movie is obviously meant for them. I no longer feel welcome to watch this franchise and will move on.","true":true}
