Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome\\, confuse\\, emotional\\, Star Wars. Best opening in the franchise\\, also too much on the last 35 minutes. JJ builded too much on VII on mystery\\, mythos\\, lore just to RJ step all over it on VIII. Disney need to explain the frigging lore to us\\, Snoke\\, rise of the first order\\, Rey\\, the force awakening in a lot of people. 9\/10 Easy.","true":true}
