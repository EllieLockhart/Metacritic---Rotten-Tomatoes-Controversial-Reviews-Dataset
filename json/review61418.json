I say this with all sincerety and as a player who pre-ordered and could not wait to play TLOU2 - I wish I hadn't. Not only is the game itself emotionally draining to play - it tarnishes my wanting to play the first game again. The game looks beautiful and plays very much like the first\\, but everything that made the previous game exceptional and an utter classic has been stripped from this game (except perhaps the music). It is not enjoyable to play unless you disregard every single cut scene and amputate the gameplay from the story and its completely dislikable characters. Even then\\, what you are left with is a game that is stunning to look at but is nothing really special to play. Without detailing specifics\\, I can see why people from every community have expressed concern about the characters. Representation and accurate diversity is important in these times. And this game will beat you to death with it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
