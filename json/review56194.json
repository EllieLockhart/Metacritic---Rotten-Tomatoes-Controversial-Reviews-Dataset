Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans give Star Wars fans a bad name. Here we have what is hands down the best film in the series since Empire\\, nearly 40 years ago\\, and we have fans that have the audacity to trash it. The Force Awakens was too derivative and the prequels were too all around terrible (I agree)\\, but where's the point of placation for the broader fandom if not here?\\n\\nThere were so many moments that filled me with wonder and scenes I've wanted for years (blowing the command center that she's stood behind for decades\\, literally forced Leia into a role she should've taken years ago). As a director\\, Johnson's storytelling flourishes are genius\\, while Yedlin fills the film with frame-worthy after frame-worthy shot. The Last Jedi was simultaneously nostalgic and fresh\\, a Star Wars film I didn't I wanted\\, but am so happy to finally have seen. \\n\\nBugger the naysayers\\, this is a exceptional filmmaking.","true":true}
