Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is dumpster fire of plot holes\\, copying and pasting from prior installments\\, stupid characters and missed opportunities. \\n\\nCan anyone explain why the First Order is incapable of calling for reinforcements\\, or hyper jumping in front of the rebel feet\\, in order to cut them off?  For 18 hours?  While other alliance ships are jumping in and out of hyper space all around them? Anyone?\\n\\nWalkers on a scenically white landscape... attacked by rebel speeders... Jedi being taken to the evil master... reluctant old jedi training new jedi (if you call it that)... a cantina like scene... We've seen it all before.\\n\\nAdmirals that don't explain their plans to characters that will have to carry out the plan... characters that don't know where to park while on a secret mission... pilots that disobey orders and get half their people killed...\\n\\nLuke Skywalker being handed his light saber by Rey... one of the greatest set-ups in history... wasted by green milk drinking and a weak force projection scene.\\n\\nI only give a 1.5 because the soundtrack was serviceable... even though I can't think of an original theme that came out of the movie.\\n\\nIf I might cannibalize a line from Luke Skywalker\\, \\\"It's time for Star Wars to end.\\\"","true":true}
