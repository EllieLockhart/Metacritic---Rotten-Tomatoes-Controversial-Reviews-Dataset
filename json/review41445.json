{"101487":184463,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a Scandal\\, at the magnitude equivalent to Enron! Everyone... the actors\\, the dedicated crew\\, even the owners Disney\\, were FLEECED by a Director whose negligence in handing a movie without doing his own homework on what Star Was is\\, ultimately pushing away long-time fans of the franchise and failing to build a new fan base with this latest installment.\\n\\nI've never ever written a review or given a rating on Rotten Tomatoes\\, but feel compelled\\, not because I'm a Star Wars fan\\, but because I'm a huge movie-lover. \\n\\nLet's put aside the Star Wars saga for a moment (as critics and reviewers here would want you to when watching TLJ)\\, even as a stand-alone movie\\, it falls short in drawing the audience in to a believable adventure and fails to make meaningful connections for its characters with its audiences. It uses pure CGI\\, meaningless action sequences to draw \\\"oohs\\\" and \\\"ahhhs\\\"\\, and cheap ill positioned slapstick jokes to get sniggers (I wouldn't call it laughs).\\n\\nI) First\\, the plot. \\nEven if you ignore ALL of episodes I to VI\\, this is the MOST uninteresting space chase saga ever written for any movie! The entire (did you notice numerous Death Stars popping into the battle zone like gremlins under a shower?!) and MASSIVE fleet of technologically advanced\\, galaxy-ruling\\, rejuvenated First Order can't catch up with a small handful of rebels right under their nose?? Come on! Anyone subscribing to and believing this main plot must either be a 3-year old (scrap that\\, it's an insult even to 3-year olds) or a moron! And\\, for the rebel fleet to run out of GAS\\, this is the most lazy story-writing in the history of Hollywood! With nuclear power already available today\\, you would think this advanced civilization would master fission energy. And\\, for consistency\\, if the rebels can run out of fuel\\, shouldn't the First Order ships suffer the same too? \\n\\nII) Second\\, characters. \\nNevermind they ignored long-loved characters like Chewy\\, R2\\, C3PO\\, Admiral Akbar\\, and yes\\, you get zero fan-time with them on screen... (let's just accept blindly that this is the new direction they want to take the series) The new characters introduced in TFA like Poe\\, Finn\\, Maz Kenanda\\, General Hux\\, BB8\\, were made to look shallow and stupid in this film. Ask yourself\\, did you connect any further with these characters? The answer will be NO! Whatever bond you had made of these new characters in TFA\\, these characters turn out to be superficial and insubstantial. Makes you even ask yourself what made you fall in love with them in the first place in TFA. \\n\\n(And\\, am I delusional\\, or did I NOT see ANY First Order Stormtroopers?? And just after I bought my 5-foot life-size stormtrooper after TFA!)\\n\\nThen just when you think the new characters of TLJ will get awesome stories and roles (Rose\\, Holdo\\, DJ\\, BB9E) they turn out to be absolute turds. As shallow as the writers and director of TLJ.\\n\\nAnd\\, the Key Characters of TLJ where literally chucked away - Snoke is a nobody and we were told in the film not to care\\, Captain Phasma was a nobody and we were told in the film not to care\\, Luke turns out to be nobody also and we were told not to care... But Rey\\, was somebody! Somebody who turns out to be a nobody\\, but we the audiences are told to care! I would\\, if she actually went through actual challenges\\, real threats\\, made some sort of sacrifice or actually did something heroic! Unfortunately\\, she did none of these. Whatever dawn of a hero I saw in her in TFA\\, turned into a quick winter sunset seeing her wasted with Luke on that island. She gets 'flirty' with Kylo\\, then force tortured by Snoke\\, and fights some unknown Plaetorian knights\\, lifts some rocks... so? What's the big deal? Am I supposed to suddenly care for her character\\, she's our new Heroine now? \\n\\nKylo Ren... OMG\\, more of the same angry tantrum throwing child. And you expect the audience to associate him with the nee GLOOMING threat to the Galaxy?? Sorry\\, that throne goes to that other tantrum throwing angry child\\, Kim Jong-Un! \\n\\nIII) Battles and Action Sequences.\\nFor space battles to be considered epic\\, there needs to be a reason for the battle\\, insurmountable odds\\, actual military tactics that reveals a KO punch at the end. Anyone saw any of these in TLJ? The entire space battle scenes were unconvincing. Tie fighters being called back from pursuit when they had the entire armada of the First Order behind them? Bombs 'dropped' in zero-gravity space? (if you wanted to copy Alien: Covenant's bomb drop scene\\, make sure you are in a planet's atmosphere for f*cks sake!). \\n\\nI'm not even going to elaborate about the absence of any lightsaber battles (bye bye lightsaber toy sales!). \\n\\nAnd no ground battles? No stormtroopers vs rebels laser battles? What did that gorilla-looking AT-AT do that made me want to buy that toy after the movie? NOTHING! \\n\\nSo that's it\\, on 3 points for any space fantasy movie\\, not even a Star Wars movie\\, 1) Plot\\, 2) Characters\\, 3) Battles\\, they all score a big FAIL. There is no reason for the 93% critics review that TLJ received. \\n\\nAs for being a Star Wars movie\\, it is a disaster of epic scale. Even a moron couldn't go wrong with Space Balls\\, how could TLJ be such a bad installment to the franchise? Well\\, after seeing how the First Order rose to epic scales after their Star-Killer Base was destroyed\\, anything's possible\\, include this major franchise screw-up.\\n\\nWho is to blame? \\n\\nWho should the wrath of the fans be directed against? Not Disney (hear me out here). Like any Corporate conglomerate\\, they see the big picture (to make money) and not the nitty gritty details. They don't even have to LIKE the business they are running. They leave it to the hands of career CEOs\\, who are supposed to know what they are doing. Similarly\\, Disney entrusted Rian Johnson to do whatever to make money from the Franchise. This means they left it to Johnson to make die-hard fans happy\\, and get new customers (new generation) to the franchise. And\\, Rian Johnson betrayed this trust of not only the fans\\, but of his employers. He took his millions from Disney\\, but didn't bother understanding the saga or its customers\\, didn't put in due time and hard work \\\"knowing the business of Star Wars\\\"\\, and ended up fleecing the audience\\, fans and Disney themselves\\, and getting away with it. Doesn't this sound like an Enron Scandal? Except for Enron\\, the culprits didn't get away! \\n\\nI'm still hopeful that Disney will NOW wake up and see that they have been fleeced by a lazy swindling Director. Take away the other Star Wars Trilogy promised to Rian Johnson (better still\\, sue him for negligence of duty). And put out a kick-ass Episode IX to get back the fans.\\n\\nI'm boycotting anything Rian Johnson puts out in Hollywood after this Episode VIII \\\"Enron\\\" Scandal of a movie.","true":true}
