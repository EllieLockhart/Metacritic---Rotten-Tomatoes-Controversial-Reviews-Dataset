Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clich\u00e8\\, tedious\\, and does not fill in any gaps from Force Awakens. Who is Snoke\\, who are Rey's parents\\, how is the first order so powerful?  WE HAVE NO IDEA!!! And neither does Disney.","true":true}
