Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mov e was to long and drug out with a lot of unnecessary side stories the ending was good but definitely not what the critics made it seem it was gonna be like.","true":true}
