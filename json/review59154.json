We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a true fan of the original LOU\\, when the leaks came out about the sequel I was devastated. I didn\u2019t completely lose faith in the game though\\, as I was hoping the scenes would be alternate scenes than what actually happens\\, I was wrong. The characters we loved so much in the first game turn into stupid\\, reckless\\, uninteresting counterparts. From Joel and Tommy literally telling the enemy where their camp is located to being so oblivious that they let their guard down\\, leading to Joel\u2019s death. What ever happened to the Joel that would drive full speed into a crying\\, helpless dude who turned out to be an enemy?? The new characters are as bland as they are forced\\, meaning the \u201csjw\u201d trend of having a trans character and Abby who is somehow bigger than every dude in the game. Naughty Dog has successfully checked the box on diversity and pushing of their own agenda rather than create a fun and powerful story that worthy of the original characters. Combat and graphics aren\u2019t enough for me to even give this game any credit because most of the time your just dreading going on. For all the people who say \u201cyou havnt even finished the game yet\u201d or people like Neil Druckman and his team who try to fool you by declaring it\u2019s something you need to experience yourself\\, don\u2019t believe the lies. They just want your money to back up the progressive\\, lazy\\, **** writing this game as all about. This is the worst game I\u2019ve ever seen\\, and it\u2019s a shame how far todays writers and content creators have fallen to where they think being diverse is essential and keep shoving that **** down our throats at the expense of the characters we actually like.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
