Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Epic\\, epic\\, epic moments in this movie. It isn\u0092t what you expect and that is exactly what you should want. When you leave wanting more\\, you know you just something special. Rian Johnson hits a home run!","true":true}
