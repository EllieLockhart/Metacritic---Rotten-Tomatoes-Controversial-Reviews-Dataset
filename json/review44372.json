Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes. Way too many useless scenes that don't add to the storyline. Probably the 3rd worst Star Wars ever. When they had no story they just wrote in a one liners to make up for it. Terrible script\\, bad use of characters\\, Finn is still useless. It's garbage wrapped up with two great characters Kylo and Rey which did an awesome job considering the lack of direction in the movie.","true":true}
