Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First I will give my feedback on the positives. The effects were obviously top notch\\, its no holds barred the opus of science fiction as far as that goes. The acting was well done\\, and the comedy light and fitting for a family film. That's that. This film as a whole was horrendous\\, not just in its plethora of plot holes and completely unexplained characters. In its follow up of previous films. It was much the original trilogy what the 80's \\\"return to Oz\\\" was to the original film. Its like the thinking was \\\"lets find the most emo edgy director possible and implode a franchise\\\". Many seem to think that any negativity towards the film is politically motivated\\, but it was terrible by any merit of storytelling. All I can figure for the disparity between critics and audiences is that Disney has deep pockets and they make offers that one simply cannot refuse.","true":true}
