Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was so bad that the \\\"after movie talk\\\" in the restrooms and lobby  was only about the local hockey score and nothing was said about the film everyone just spent 2.5 hours watching.  It should be thrown over someones shoulder and discarded.","true":true}
