Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flashy visually stunning action packed sequel to The Force Awakens. that refreshingly is mostly it's own thing\\,\\nBut it horribly fails in basic story telling\\, with blatant plot holes\\, gimmicky plot-twists\\, off-kilter pacing\\, lack of character developments and too many characters and plot-lines. It's so bloated\\, it never does any of them justice; lingering too long where pacing should have been picked up and rushing where dramatic pauses would have been warranted.\\nThey all comes together in an explosive climax that sizzles out of existence without a cliffhanger or a set-up that makes you want to see the next installment as TESB or TFA did. It feels like an ending\\, not a second act!\\n\\nIt also disregarding the trilogies it supposed to add to as well as disregarding most of the set-ups of The Force Awakens\\, which painfully lays bear a visionary clash that result in awkwardly clear inconsistencies.\\nIt feels as if there is no overall vision for the entire new trilogy to guide the writer(s). No clue what they want for E-IX\\, but also no sneak peaks at the end of TLJ to make us\\, viewers curious enough to want to see E-IX","true":true}
