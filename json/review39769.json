Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a movie that's riddled with plot holes\\, has Leia playing Mary Poppins and Luke Skywalker given a complete new personality. This is without a doubt the first Star Wars movie i can say was\\, in my opinion\\, simply rubbish. Episode VII was alright but this was just bad... It does in fact make me kind of sad.","true":true}
