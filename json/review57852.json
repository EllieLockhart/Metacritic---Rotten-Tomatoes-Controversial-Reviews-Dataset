Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, normally I don\u2019t write reviews\\, but there are a lot of people on here whining and moaning about how this movie ruined their lives\\, so I felt like I had to bring reason to the table. This is an excellently shot\\, well written movie. Kylo Ren is an increasingly interesting\\, unpredictable villain. Luke is what he\u2019s always been; it\u2019s hard to describe without spoilers\\, but he\u2019s always been the one to think he is right\\, overconfident. Seeing what happened to him to make him the way he is in this movie made perfect sense\\, and it was a really fascinating character arc. I won\u2019t go into every character\\, but this movie had so many good things going on with people internally and what makes them grow\\, what makes them who they are. I really enjoyed this smart\\, funny film that wasn\u2019t afraid to defy expectations and ground things in reality. I\u2019m sorry\\, but not everyone is some predestined hero\\, and seeing Luke question the ways of Jedis was something I really appreciated. Hats off to this movie. Oh\\, and one more thing... how come people hate this movie for being \u201cshallow\u201d but loved Rogue One? That movie had more plot holes than Swiss cheese\\, and the characters were cardboard cut outs. Anyways\\, don\u2019t rely on other me or others to tell you what to think. See the movie yourself and then make your own opinion. ","true":true}
