Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It literally made me want to use a cheese grater on my genitals. At no point did they re read or re look at a scene. This movie has torn down everything that made the movies great. Luke skywalker is now a pathetic shell of his once great character. I also must add that this movies humor was very juvinille and the plot on the casino planet was just out of place. I also must add that this film was basically a chase scene the whole way through.\\nso in conclusion this story does not really expand or explain much and it has no point of existing. Just like the entirety of Disney's new starwars.","true":true}
