Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the deluge of negative of reviews this is a great film. It's not perfect but a really enjoyable delve into the Star Wars universe. There a few genuine twists and many need to let go of what they thought or hoped would happen; things are wide open for the finale in episode 9.","true":true}
