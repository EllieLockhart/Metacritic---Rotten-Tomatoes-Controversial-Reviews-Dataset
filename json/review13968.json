Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you ever wanted to see a high budget Star Wars spoof this film is for you. I can only conceive this film was intentionally made to piss off Star Wars fans or was made in the world of idiocracy. Boycott the next movie\\, bleep off Disney.\\n90% Critic score what movie did they watch or more importantly how dishonest are they. Disney maybe too big a studio and powerful to give a bad review or they have been greased up. Well they can write rave reviews all they want but the fact is the movie is utter garbage & needs deleting from history.\\n(Back to the Future 4) Doc Brown and Marty Mcfly travel back in time to rescue the Star Wars franchise from Disney & Rian Johnson as this has huge & disastrous implications on society and the direction of Hollywood Films which influence all pop culture etc.\\nThey travel back to October 29th\\, 2012\\, to stop George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Walt Disney Corporations & instead sell to Warner Bros and have the Star Wars sequels Written & Directed by Christopher Nolan.
