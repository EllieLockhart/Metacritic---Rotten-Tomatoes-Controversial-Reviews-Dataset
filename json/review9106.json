Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of twists and spins takes a whole new approach to Star Wars. Some people say it\u2019s too different but I am really into it. Last movie people said it was too much like ANH and now they\u2019re complaining it\u2019s not enough like ESB. I love how it\u2019s fresh and new the past was killed to move towards the future and I am fully on board with it. The movie is suspenseful\\, shocking\\, dark\\, and yet so funny I think Rian Johnson did an incredible job and I can\u2019t wait to see what he does with episode IX. (Also the acting is phenomenal I would recommend watching it just for Adam Driver\u2019s performance) ","true":true}
