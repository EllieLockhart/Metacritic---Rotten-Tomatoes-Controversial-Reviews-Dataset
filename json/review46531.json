Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched it using boxxy software app. Visually stunning\\, but a terrible plot and even more pointless side plot. Rian Johnson seemed more interested in upsetting expectations of the audience than in the story of the characters of this film. I think this might be least favorite Star Wars film of them all.","true":true}
