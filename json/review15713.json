Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\,  I thought that Rian did a fantastic job in creating characters who had depth and in exploring the relationships between the characters.  This is definitely a thinking persons version of start wars\\,  This is definitely not a movie for navel gazing yahoos\\, who prefer their characters with big boobs (possibly and apron) and a plot low on talking high on grunting and  guns.  I have enjoyed every Star Wars experience from 1977 and can't honestly say I actually had flutters of excitement and anticipation while watching this film.  There were no character assassinations (think some people's watch too many conspiracy theories) but just a grown up story in my favourite galaxy far far away.  As encouraged by my favourite podcast.... if you hated\\, loathed and are in a world of pain as this movie ruined your childhood....... then you were never a fan.... maybe just a wanna Ben cool kid wanting to hang out with the fan.... think it's  time to build a bridge and get over it... then burn that' bridge  so you won't  be tempted to cross it again.  Well done Rian\\, can't wait for your next Star Wars instalment.","true":true}
