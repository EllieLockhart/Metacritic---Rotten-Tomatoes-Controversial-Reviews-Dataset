Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot lines are similar to those witnessed on daytime television. Just put the characters in a different galaxy\\, and voila\\, you've got yourself a soap opera in space. This movie was 152 minutes too long.","true":true}
