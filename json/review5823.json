Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed overall. A few great scenes\\, way to many plot holes. To much forced wit and really doesn\u2019t have the \u201cfeel\u201d of the rest of the Star Wars franchise. I love Star Wars overall and had to give it at least 2 stars. ","true":true}
