{"101487":196301,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? Leia as Mary Poppins in the cold vacuum of space? No back story to all-powerful Sith Lord Snokes? The legendary Luke Skywalker killing Darth Sidious\\, then bring Vader back to the good side as Anakin\\, now a hermit who is scared of the Force and offs himself? No\\, Rian Johnson has destroyed GL's magic of movies. Han Solo dies in an epic way from his son\\, but Luke doesn't go out in a bigger way even though his character is much larger by far?! If Luke was going to die anyway\\, why make the hologram\/force projection scene at all? Why not just put Luke there in person in an epic final battle showing all he had learned and how he was the most powerful of Jedi? Because Leia cannot be on the next film\\, why kill off Luke?! From Anakin to his children\\, to the grandkids being powerful Jedi\/Sith\\, then why kill the family lineage off. Luke was an afterthought per Disney\/Rian with the 'here's the big story\\, and oh by the way\\, Luke dies'. RIDICULOUS! Episode 8 needs to be REDONE by at least JJ Abrams\\, or Disney should flat out apologize to GL and call it a redo\\, because Rian Johnson and Disney clearly DO NOT GET IT! Rogue One is a world better than TLJ\\, TLJ doesn't belong in the series of epic movies. GL is spinning in his grave! But seriously\\, GL should recall the rights from Di$ney. I firmly believe now Di$ney has paid reviewers and critics off for the artificially high ratings. Even the poster art doesn't evoke questions or mysteries like the GL movies. This is simply a way to generate $ by intro'ing new animal characters and not subtly like Ewok's or droids in scenes. It's like Di$ney marketeers literally wrote the entire script for TLJ\\, I am not considering this 'Justice League' amatuerish film a part of the Star Wars legacy\\, it simply is NOT! I'll see Ep 9 from JJ Abrams for sure\\, and hopefully he can literally resurrect Luke and show he is the most-powerful Jedi to have lived\\, and the Skywalker legend was\/is true. This movie doesn't even feel like a true Star Wars film\\, just a revenue generator for Di$ney. Pathetic. GL focused on story and characters\\, yet this one is far removed from that path\\, sad af really. Where is Lando? Sorry folks\\, it's worth seeing just to confirm how Rian Johnson literally works at destroying GL legacy and storyline of the Skywalker family\\, thanks for nothing Di$ney\\, you ruined Walt's vision for children\\, and now ruined a generation of loyal GL Star Wars fans","true":true}
