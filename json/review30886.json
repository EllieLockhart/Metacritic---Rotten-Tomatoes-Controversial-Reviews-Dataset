Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social justice agenda has become the only concern of Disney\/Kennedy\/Johnson. I fear that in the next installment of the saga we will see a handicapped jedi on a wheelchair\\, obviously woman\\, obviously black\/oriental\/redskin\/aborigen\\, maybe bisexual\/transgender\/gay\/lesbian\/metrosexual\\, hopefully with asperger's or ADHD. If the statistics will discover another group with \\\"differences\\\"\\, I think they will include it too. Maybe they should start considering those with eating disorders\\, premenstrual syndrome or allergies. After having found a way to include all of the available or conceivable \\\"different human types\\\"\\, maybe they will devote a couple of committee meetings for developing a script which will obviously be full of inconsistencies and plot holes but\\, as mentioned before\\, their only concern is to be all-inclusive. Everything is OK for me. I have only one request: please don't call it Star Wars.","true":true}
