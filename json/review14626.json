Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been watching Star Wars since 1977.  If you think this movie was bad go back and watch Episodes I-III.  Those deserve bad reviews. If you don't like the movie\\, go home and write your own fan fiction and make everything happen the way you wanted it.  Last Jedi was unpredictable which is difficult to do considering source material.","true":true}
