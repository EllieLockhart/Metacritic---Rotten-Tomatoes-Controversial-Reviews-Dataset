Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Generic Disney trash with a Star Wars veneer. Follows the same old plot as every animated film you have ever seen. Destruction of historical characters and thinly veiled liberal political undertones. Welcome to 2018.","true":true}
