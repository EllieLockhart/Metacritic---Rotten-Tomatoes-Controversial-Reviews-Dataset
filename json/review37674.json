Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There should be a \\\"wish I could unwatch\\\" option.  There are some many basic plot holes that aren't addressed. Missed opportunities that could have made this a better than average Star Wars movie.\\n\\nIt fails\\, generally across the board\\, the writing\\, direction\\, acting. Effects and Music are the two good things from this movie.\\n\\nThis was the beginning of the end for the franchise.\\n\\nI can only hope that with JJ Abrams back on the helm the 9th movie can have a modicum of redemption.","true":true}
