Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold and intriguing approach to Star Wars\\, which exposed us to brand new frontiers. The new approaches to characters\\, feuds among heroes and villains alike\\, a new approach to character heritage\\, the deconstruction of the benevolent msster and the connection between protagonist and villain are what make this movie stand out. It is also not only fascinating; it is also extremely beautiful and well shot and the acting is incredible. The relationship between Rey and Kylo is perfectly executed\\, and exposing Luke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s weaknesses\\, while also humanising him is one of the best things the franchise has ever done. His fall and subsequent rise to legendary status was beautiful. Overall\\, this movie opened up a brand new route for the franchise.","true":true}
