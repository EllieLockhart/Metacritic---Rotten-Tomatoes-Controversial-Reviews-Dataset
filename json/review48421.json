Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With only a few exceptions relating to some cheesy floating scenes and my ongoing and irrationally intense irritation with the \\\"Kylo Dork\\, Angry IT Guy\\\" character\\, I found this to be an incredibly entertaining movie.  I would totally see it again!!","true":true}
