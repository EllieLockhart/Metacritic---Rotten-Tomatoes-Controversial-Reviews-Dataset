Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" has left me shocked and awestruck. I really don't have a clue about the next episode\\,I don't even have an idea what story they're going to cover there. I feel like episode VIII has covered most of the major issues episode VII introduced and there's not much space where episode IX can go into. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was an action driven movie\\, with many thrills\\, hooked me and amazed me. Many great performances by the whole cast. I had only a small issue with the plot at some point but it was never important enough to ruin the movie. The action was unlike anything Star Wars ever did. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" took chances no other movies in the franchise chose to take and it carried them through. I just hope it will hold up in the long run.","true":true}
