Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's time for Star Wars to end. Completely unimaginable if you had asked me just a week ago\\, these words\\, coming from a life-long fan such as myself\\, reflect the disbelief and sorrow of seeing 40 years of elaborate mythology\\, beloved characters and captivating storytelling be replaced by a poorly executed and cynically conceived film that mocks and betrays the Star Wars universe. \\n\\nFilled with substandard writing\\, nonsensical plots\\, terrible pacing\\, overuse of cheap humor\\, one-liners and shock value\\, Rian Johnson's creation fails to deliver as a stand-alone film\\, much less as a continuation of the most anticipated saga in cinematic history. \\n\\nThe film doesn't just miss the mark\\, we've had a number of Star Wars films do that in the past (here's looking at you prequels)\\, but rather has an immensely negative impact on the franchise as a whole going forward that I'm unconvinced it will ever truly recover from. Indeed\\, when George Lucas made the prequels\\, many fans were critical regarding the quality of the films\\, but that criticism was \\\"in-house\\\"\\, with the existing creator still adored as the person who had already given fans the greatest gift of all\\, The Original Trilogy. Despite the shortcomings of the prequels\\, Episodes I-III mostly provided Star Wars fans context as to how we arrived at our initial story\\, not a direct continuation of it. \\n\\nHowever\\, the same cannot be said of Episodes VII-IX\\, especially considering the critical role played by the three central characters of the Original Trilogy. Of the original big three\\, Han Solo\\, which much of The Force Awakens focused on\\, was handled extraordinarily well by director JJ Abrams. That is in stark contrast as to how Rian Johnson handled the Skywalker twins. \\n\\nMost of the film focused on an exaggeratedly cynical Luke\\, who's iconic character from the last time we saw him in Return of the Jedi replaced by silly winks\\, brushing of the shoulders\\, one-liners and murderous and self-deprecating tendencies in a ridiculous setting\\, filled with milked sea creatures\\, alien nuns\\, and Porgs\\, who although share their cute physical attributes with the Ewoks\\, served absolutely no purpose to the plot. The disparaging depiction of Luke bears very little resemblance to the balanced and developed hero we last saw bring Darth Vader back to the light. But don't take my word for it\\, I'll let Mark Hammill sum up the director's take on Luke: \\\"At one point I had to say to Rian [Johnson]\\, 'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character.'\\\"\\n\\nThe use of Leia's character\\, initially intended to be focused on in the final film before Carrie Fischer's untimely death last year\\, was kept to a minimum and executed in a disappointing fashion. Her flight through space\\, and the circumstances that led up to it\\, were more befitting of a Marvel film\\, feeling foreign and out of place within the Star Wars universe. Apart from her final conversation with Luke\\, Leia's character was devoid of any depth\\, with her regrettably being put in a coma for most of the film. In relation to the storyline\\, this made matters even worse as it led to a leadership void that created not one\\, but two of the most nonsensical plots in Star Wars history which took up nearly half the film\\, making the longest Star Wars to date mostly just a filler for the final installment. \\n\\nDespite Johnson's misuse of old characters and excess cheap shock value\\, those components were nowhere near as deficient as the weak writing and unnecessary subplots that had a detrimental impact on the new characters of the latest trilogy. The power struggle between Poe and Holdo and the misadventures of Finn and Rose\\, both intended to highlight the themes of learning from failure and love triumphing over hate\\, failed to convey the intended meaning\\, failed at building believable new characters or developing existing ones and even failed to contribute anything relating to a cleverly-conceived plot. \\n\\nBut\\, I hear many of you ask\\, aren't fans of Star Wars known for being super critical concerning anything outside the Original Trilogy? Partially true\\, but this time truly is different as I'll further explain later. Instead\\, I'll take this opportunity to address the few positive components of the film before seriously answering what I believe to be the main reason for most of the criticism and backlash against The Last Jedi. \\n\\nFirst off\\, the cinematography and the music of this film were stunning. Some of the best work in those departments to ever be seen or heard in a Star Wars film. Also\\, the impressive acting performances of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) and Daisy Ridley (Rey) were quality through and through\\, both of them should be commended for their work. The storyline of these two\\, sped up through their unique communication method\\, were mostly filler for the next installment\\, however the execution of it was light years better than anything else resembling cohesiveness in this film. The throne room scene was visually spectacular\\, though I am convinced that Disney did not allow Rey to temporarily go to the dark side which would have added a much more compelling element for her character than simply rendezvousing offscreen with Chewy just to lift rocks at the conclusion of the movie.\\n \\nNow to address what I believe is the main source of most of the criticism of The Last Jedi. It's important to note that for the most part\\, the previous two installments in the Star Wars universe\\, The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, were well received by fans\\, with the former successfully introducing new characters\\, plots and mysteries that were discussed and debated at length over the past couple of years. \\n\\nBy emphasizing certain central plot points and mysteries in the previous film\\, and encouraging moviegoers to theorize about them\\, much of the vast disappointment from Star Wars fans stems from these elements being immediately abandoned or deemed completely irrelevant at the onset of the sequel in an intended irony that falls flatter than Luke's lightsaber being thrown on the ground. How are fans supposed to take the ending of The Force Awakens\\, or the entire movie for that matter\\, seriously when the dramatic questions and perplexities raised in it\\, such as Snoke's origins\\, Rey's powers and lineage\\, the Knights of Ren\\, and more are so cynically and abruptly disregarded as unimportant in The Last Jedi? \\n\\nDespite the lackluster revelations (if they can even be called that)\\, the biggest sin of The Last Jedi was the problem of continuity within the framework of the Star Wars story. If this is indeed one Skywalker saga\\, as Episodes I-IX have been dubbed\\, the continuity of every film in the series is the fabric that binds the Star Wars universe and its characters together. The Last Jedi was simply unrecognizable in this regard and ignored the strong foundation that the Star Wars canon has continuously built upon over the last 40 years. \\n\\nUnlike what some defenders of the film would have you believe\\, the criticism of The Last Jedi is unrelated to fans wanting to feel nostalgic or an unacceptance of new storytelling. Instead\\, Johnson's seemingly arrogant disrespect can easily be identified in Kylo Ren's proclamation of \\\"Let the past die\\\"\\, an accurate description of the importance the director attributes to everything that has come before him in past Star Wars films. Many fans are justifiably disgruntled with Rian Johnson as his unique take and permanent mark on the series feels more like a hijacking than a continuation of the story and development of characters\\, both old and new\\, that we have come to know and love. The 180-degree about-face in narrative between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi felt contradictory with the progression away from the former coming more abruptly than Poe Dameron's newly invented X-Wing U-turn.  \\n\\nIf this is indeed where the Star Wars franchise is headed\\, don't expect life-long fans like myself to follow the next jump to light speed past Episode IX.","true":true}
