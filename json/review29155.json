Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Real Star Wars fans who grew up watching the originals wanted a continuation of the story\\, as in what happens to the galaxy after The Empire is defeated.  The plot in Last Jedi is just a reboot.  Leia\\, Luke\\, and Han - these characters seem to just get in the way doing a true reboot.","true":true}
