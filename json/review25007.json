Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My problem with The Last Jedi is not with the cast\\, themes or bold new direction of the film. \\\"Diverse cast in Star Wars playing major roles.\\\" Fantastic! Let's actually get tons more of that! \\\"Letting go of the past.\\\" Hell yeah let's do something new! \\\"Giving the middle finger to your fan theories.\\\" Fuck yeah! That's bold and I love it My issue is that all of this is poorly executed on a Prequels level scale. If the common movie going sheeple knew the first thing about storytelling they would realize that this film is a mess from start to finish. But Mickey Mouse Doesn't care. Because all of you (and me) will still buy a ticket to the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one.......","true":true}
