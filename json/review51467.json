Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A cluttered mess of a movie whose great exposition of the force is marred by fundamentally flawed structure\\, flow\\, and humor that's tonally off. Luke is excellently played by Mark Hamil\\, and his interactions with Rey are the highlight of the movie. But the rest of the cast are such bungling failures--with no redeeming character arc--that this movie drags at a Bantha's pace.","true":true}
