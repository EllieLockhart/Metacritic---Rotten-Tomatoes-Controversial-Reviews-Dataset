We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I won't lie and say I'm the biggest Last of Us fan\\, that I 100% the game\\, got it early\\, etc. However what I will tell you is that it is a good game\\, the visuals and audio design are gorgeous\\, the developers added a much-needed coat of paint to the mechanics\\, it is a very solid base. However\\, the criticisms come with the story and characters.\r\rI think what NaughtyDog did with the game is bold\\, killing one of the beloved characters and forcing the player to play as the character who killed them. I won't say I was happy with it\\, but I could also see that ND wanted to create the narrative that \\\"every story has two sides\\\" and ask that you consider the sympathy towards what Abby has gone through and how it parallel's Ellie's story. There has also been complaints that Ellie would never 'act the way she does' within the game\\, however\\, as someone who has watched a close family member die\\, her anger and spite are understandable and especially in such an uncut setting\\, it makes sense that she'd feel so strongly as to do what she does.\r\rA lot of other reviews I've read seem to take the game too seriously as if Naughty dog promised them something and then snatched it away. It isn't like that\\, this game is a new chapter in an already developed story\\, Ellie is 20 by the end of the story\\, all she knows is pain and loss. This game isn't about wrapping up Ellie's story\\, it's showing the end of Ellie's journey and the result of what she has caused.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
