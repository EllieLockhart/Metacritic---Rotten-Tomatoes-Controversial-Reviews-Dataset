Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"8 movies about the skywalkers and now they are gone???? Too far away from the story line of the movies before it. Did the story group take time off to let this stuff get by them?","true":true}
