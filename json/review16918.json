Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only come to RT to check the critics rating but I decided to sign up just to write this short review.\\n\\nYou have to notice that the whole movie plot and the flow of the storytelling was actually worse than the Attack of the Clones. I had such a high hope with this movie because critics' ratings were pretty consistent with my experience. However\\, the only explanation that I can come up with after watching the movie is that the critics got paid by Disney. Or they watched a complete different movie. Or they are afraid of writing an honest review.\\n\\nI am stunned. I simply don't understand how you can give this movie a positive review. \\n\\nI love Star Wars but this is not it. This is not Star Wars.","true":true}
