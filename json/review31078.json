Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I recently went to see this film and  very excited as I genuinely loved 'The Force Awakens'\\, the film that breathed fresh ideas into one of the most iconic film franchises of all time after the somewhat disappointing SW4\\, 5 and 6! So imagine my suprise when I watched this convulated\\, disjointed narative which confuses the audience from the very first Act! The best part about TFA was the chemistry between Rey and Finn\\, so what do they do\\, split them up\\, only bringing them together in the last scene for what looks to be the most ridiculous love  triangle ever seen in a movie! Add that to what at first looks to be the main narrative of the film\\, the destruction of the Sith and the Jedi and Luke starwalker isolation but then decides that's a  bad idea so as Luke Astrally projects himself at light speed over the universe\\, he then contradicts himself and tells Kylo Ren that Rey is indeed the Last Jedi\\, or is it the young child in the last act who magically draws a broom to his hand! Of course I could be completely wrong and it might be Leila who can now fly in Space!!! \\n  So much of this film is just so confusingly disjointed and yes I get that it's roots are set up as 'The Empire Strikes Back' in the new 3 film franchise but here's the thing\\, people walked out of the cinema 2hrs into the Movie and I fully  understand why? It drags from scene to scene without letting any of the many plots fully develop properly\\, who are the red Sith Warriors that Kylor Ren and Rey cut down\\, we will never know? Oh yes there are moments of Star Wars spectacle\\, and some decent humour if you can be bothered to sit through this bore fest of a movie! \\n   I never believed that Disney bought the critics\\, often believing it was just sour grapes from DC fans but having seen this film\\, it is nowhere near as good as Justice League or Thor Ragnorak or Wonderwoman or any major Blockbuster this year\\, this is a backward step in the Starwars franchise after the brilliant Force Awakens movie\\, and this might actually be the film that finally proves that a Fresh score from the critics where Disney is concerned is now no guarantee of  quality! Do yourselves a favour go watch Justice league while its still in the cinemas\\, you'll have a lot more fun!!!!","true":true}
