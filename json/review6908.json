Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dumbfounded by the bad reviews... This was a fantastic movie. Main story was he character development and archs of Rey\\, Ren\\, and Luke - and it was done beautifully. The movie was gorgeous. The action was the best it's been. Everything about this movie was unbelievably good. \\n\\nSPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\n\\nThe main criticisms by fans:\\nLuke dies \\\"randomly\\\" and for \\\"no reason\\\" = Yoda's death \\nSnoke's backstory was never explained before death = the emperor\\nRay comes from nobody = Anakin (but in reality\\, Ray's story is better. Ray's fear is that she is nobody. This plot point adds to her story)\\nPhasma was worthless = Boba after\\n\\nThe only legitimate general criticism I've read is that the casino side plot wasn't necessary. It wasn't. But it was certainly fun to watch\\, and added a couple new interesting characters. \\n\\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\\nSo maybe people just overhyped this movie in their head? I don't see any huge plot flaws that weren't present in ESB. This movie was different and refreshing. Far better than TFA. Don't listen to the fanboys on this one. This was th best of the series!","true":true}
