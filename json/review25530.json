Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS: One word disappointed\\, it was a ok film but certainly not to the standard of a Star Wars film and most of the people I have spoken to have who have said it was good then went on to list the catalogue of things that where wrong with the film.\\n\\nThe problem for me was not the humour it was how unsubtle the homour was I wanted to see a Star Wars film not a quibby Marvel film which also served to make the film have a inconsistant tone character arcs where jumbled and inconsistent\\, and I have discussed this with a few people the things that happened in the film are not the issue it was the execution used to get to the end result there where moments in the film I should have been touched but instead I found them laughable.","true":true}
