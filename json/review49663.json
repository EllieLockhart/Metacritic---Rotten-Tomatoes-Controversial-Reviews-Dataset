{"101487":199462,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what a disappointment\\, I generally liked the force awakens but acknowledge it's flaws but last Jedi seems like a bag full of missed opportunities. Flying Leia\\,? really? Hologram force projection Luke? Just really really bad compounded by the fact that they unwaveringly built Leia's character up for the next movie when they had a perfect opportunity to cleanly end her storyline which would have been prudent given the circumstances. I think this is the end of Star wars for me","true":true}
