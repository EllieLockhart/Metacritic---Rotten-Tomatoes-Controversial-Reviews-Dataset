Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give this film 0 stars I would. I didn't truly realize how terrible of a movie this is until I saw The Rise of Skywalker having to correct all of its mistakes. 91% is nonsense.","true":true}
