Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has layers upon layers and delves into the weaknesses of the Resistance\\, The First Order\\, and individual characters themselves while tackling political themes\\, overarching societal themes\\, and many human aspects. This movie stays true to the Star Wars saga but develops it into a much deeper film. The graphics\\, acting\\, casting\\, and directing were all great!","true":true}
