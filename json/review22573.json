Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let the past die and throw your expectations out the window. I loved the film and that it subverted my expectations. It may even replace Empire as my favourite film in the franchise. It's a visual treat and sets the bar high for episode 9. Its a shame some \\\"Star Wars fans\\\" are so upset because at the end of the day it is a movie and it's ok to dislike it without starting a revolution.","true":true}
