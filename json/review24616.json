Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie starts with unfunny\\, childish humor and never gets into a groove. Complicated storyline is difficult to follow and many major characters are forgettable. A few good scenes here and there\\, but overall a hot mess and wasted oppprtunity.","true":true}
