Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First one was bad\\, a rerun\\, but hey\\, it was still Star Wars....this movie sucked. Too many deus ex machina moments\\, gutless rebels\\, all the males are useless\\, all the women are wise leaders...*spits* It's one thing to be politically correct--quite another to shove it down everyone's throats. Disney sucks\\, and it's bleeding through. 8.1 critics are shills because this movie was flat out bad. Mark Hamill said\\, \\\"not my Luke Skywalker\\,\\\" well\\, not my Star Wars either--no real light saber duels\\, no jedi skill\\, no Sith power\\, just BLAH","true":true}
