Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has been turned into a comedy without a coherent plot line and a complete dismantling od the original characters. They turned our heroes (Han\\, Lea\\, and Luke) into forgotten senior citizens. Chewy a once beloved sidekick\\, disregarded as though he had no place in history. These movies could certainly paved the way for new characters without turning Han into a bumbling fool after saving the galaxy twice. He could've gone out in a blaze of glory. Our beloved Princess turned into Marry Poppins. Our Last of the Jedi\\, Luke into a grumpy old troll. So  they could've gone. Even if you attempted to be open to what they've done here\\, the characters they created\\, Snoke for example\\, turned out to be a nobody. At least that's how he was treated. Two years worth of theories thrown around by the deepest Star Wars fans of many generations\\, tossed out like trash. \\nRight now I'd be happy to take one of the most outrageous theories over the rediculous circus. It has left this Star Wars fan without any hope. Help us future Kenobi movie\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
