Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could have been so much more. Didn't seem to take it's ques from the Force Awakens and just went staggering along in its own confused way. Much like a drunk after a long day of boozing.","true":true}
