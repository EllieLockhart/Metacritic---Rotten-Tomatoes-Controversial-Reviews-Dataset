Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed all the plot threads I was interested in from TFA\\, and didn't really create any new ones that I'm excited about it. Also it was nowhere near as fun or interesting as TFA. But I liked most of the new characters and the overall messages and theme were good.","true":true}
