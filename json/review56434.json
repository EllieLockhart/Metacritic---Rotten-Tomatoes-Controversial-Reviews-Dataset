Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The character archs for Kylo and Rey were excellent. The handful of sequences that were good were great.  \\n\\nHowever\\, this movie had distracting cheap humor\\, had ridiculous sub plots\\, and did nothing to build on The Force Awakens.  Laura Dern and Benny Del Toro's characters were unlikeable to the core.  The writing is SO bad. I could just go on and on.","true":true}
