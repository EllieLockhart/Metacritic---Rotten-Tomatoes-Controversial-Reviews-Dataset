Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the scale of Hollywood movies\\, it's OK.  It's long\\, the plot is a ridiculous mess\\, but that applies to a lot of things.  On the scale of a Star Wars fan's expectations --- highly disappointing.  Lucas had already basically ruined Star Wars\\, but Disney seems determined to make it worse.","true":true}
