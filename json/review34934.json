Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is technically very strong\\, contains cool new ideas about the lore\\, and has excellent performances by Hamill and Driver\\, but at the end of the day TLJ is a poorly constructed narrative with characters I simply don't like. \\n\\nThe film acts as a clear sign that Disney has no overarching plan for this new trilogy and\\, worse\\, is willing to remove its leadership from responsibility by granting complete freedom to overhyped \\\"auteurs\\\". \\n\\nYes\\, I signed up an account to specifically comment on a Star Wars film and yes\\, I'm doing it on Christmas Day... but my family is driving me crazy and this has been cathartic.","true":true}
