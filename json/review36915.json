Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Movie was full of SJW crap No Male heroes allowed only the women was able to be the heroes of the film the few times the male heroes had a chance to shine and step up to be said hero the Feminist roll took shut it down quickly I almost wanted to ask for my money back Bad writing and bad plot timing","true":true}
