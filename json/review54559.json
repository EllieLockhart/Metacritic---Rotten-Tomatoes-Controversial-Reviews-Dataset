Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm getting to old for this.  This is not \\\"our\\\" Star Wars anymore. Huge letdown after decades of George \\\"maybe\/maybe not\\\" antisipation. Just in case it's not obvious enough\\, we get the books burned to leave no doubt that what has come before is no longer wanted or cared for.  Clean slate is an understatement.  Mass appeal approach is to be expected; but you CAN make a movie that appeals to children\\, the \\\"Twilight\\\" crowd and also viewers like me.  Major missed opportunity. I'll just keep re-watching the end of ROTJ. Luke will always be the hero archetype and nothing that Disney does will change that for me.  Those that felt a \\\"disturbance in the force\\\" when Disney bought Lucasfilm were right.  Shame on you Kath and the Disney puppeteers that pull your strings.","true":true}
