Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been watching Star Wars and been a huge fan since 1980 and I loved The Last Jedi.  Though I grew up with heroes like Luke\\, Leia\\, Han\\, Obi-wan\\, and Yoda....I'm ready to say by to them and become a fan of new characters and the new direction Star Wars is heading to.","true":true}
