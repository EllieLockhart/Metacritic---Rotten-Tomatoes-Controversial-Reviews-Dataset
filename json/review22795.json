Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"l loved it because it's star wars. i understand every argument made by long time star wars fans that hated it. i just some how\\, naively\\, decided i was going to like it before it even started\\, because it's star wars. There are some elements I'm disappointed in\\, but overall\\, i just can't wait to see how it all gets tied up in the next one. ","true":true}
