Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointing movie. Every story arc they got wrong\\, every build up they led to a total let down. Luke's character was utterly wrong. Too many dumb sub plots that led nowhere. A sprinkling of SJW propaganda. And way too many dumb slapstick jokes just to entertain the audience. I'd watch episodes 1-3 all day before seeing this movie again.\\n\\nBut hey\\, there were flashy lights and CGI.\\n\\nThe music was good.","true":true}
