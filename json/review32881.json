Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Was The Last Jedi Was Awesome movie I liked it the others on here who said it was terrible and gave it a bad rating are not true fans of Star Wars there fake fans that have to hate on a good movie like there butts hurt and try to tell others it sucked when they are wrong these people need to Grow Up and stop whinning and acting like 6 year olds crybabys","true":true}
