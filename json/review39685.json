Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a disaster of a film.  It has ruined the franchise and retroactively made previous films worse.  I wish Disney had never bought Star Wars and want George Lucas to take it back.  I wish Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson and the entire story group in charge of this travesty were never born.\\n\\nStar Wars is now dead to me and I will NEVER see another Star Wars film.","true":true}
