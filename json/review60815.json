The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Finished the game in about 30 hours and overall I enjoyed it\\, but I can also understand the criticism the game is receiving from a large group of gamers\\, and even agree with some points. So here it goes:\r\r- Is this game better than the first one? No\\, it is not\\, this game lacks some key elements of the first one\\, like the journey across multiple cities or the \\\"us against the world\\\" feeling so present in TLOU.\r\r- Is this the game a masterpiece? Graphically speaking\\, yes it is\\, it looks amazing. The performance of the voice actor and actresses is top notch and very convincing\\, really a 10 out of 10. But it's not perfect enough to be called a masterpiece. There's too much repetition combat wise\\, for example.\r\r- Is the story good? That's a tough one\\, yes and no\\, but the only way I found to answer that is by saying: its a good story for this game alone\\, but as a story worthy of a sequel to the first game? No. Like I said before\\, it's not the same feeling as it lacks key elements of the first game.\r\r- Is there wokeness in the game? Yes\\, and I most definitely don't like politics and social activism in games\\, because it tends to ruin them\\, but it's not a big issue in TLOU2. It didn't bother me in this case.\r\r- Was Joel's death really necessary to the sequel? Not in my opinion\\, there was other possibilities\\, it did work for the story\\, but still didn't like this creative choice from Naughty Dog. This was very disappointing.\r\rWell\\, I do think people should play this game\\, but I would wait for some PSN sale in the future.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
