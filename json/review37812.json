Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were parts of the movie that I liked and it was well made. The reason I am rating this so low is I also feel like they did a disservice to the franchise. Ben Solo says \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to.\\\" That was him channeling Rian Johnson. If you \\\"kill\\\" the past\\, Star Wars has no future.","true":true}
