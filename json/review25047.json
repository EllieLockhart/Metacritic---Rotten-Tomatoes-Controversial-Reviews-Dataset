Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My thoughts are perfectly expressed by many others with 1 or half stars.  This movie was just so disappointing and completely unnecessarily bad.  Rian Johnson should not have anything to do with star wars.  You did a good job with rogue one and force awakens\\, wtf Disney?","true":true}
