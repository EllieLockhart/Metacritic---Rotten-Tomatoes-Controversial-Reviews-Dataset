Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This a \\\"you either hate it or love it\\\" movie. The same people that hate the prequels keep hating. There are. A few minor details that i would have changed\\, but i was glued. Kylo gained my respect as a villain (in force awakens he was weak and pathetic). I didn't know how i felt about Luke in the beginning and middle of the movie\\, but the end effectively finished his character development.","true":true}
