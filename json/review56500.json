Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a solid entry in the Star Wars cannon\\, as is The Last Jedi. That's the thing however - it's solid.\\n\\nThis is\\, sadly\\, also the movie where the franchise finally jumps the shark for the most committed of fans. Not wishing to give too much of the plot away\\, but it now seems that survival and mobility in the vacuum of space is down to how well one can wield The Force.\\n \\nThat sudden jolt meant however\\, that I was no longer in that little bubble where belief has been suspended; where artificial planets can be built to romp about space blowing planets up\\, where Jedi knights can die as Sebastian Shaw yet controversially return as a ghost of Hayden Christensen\\, where there exists a training school for Storm Troopers whose function is to show them when to recognise those points where the plot needs to be expedited before shooting straight.\\n\\nNo longer was I watching a Star Wars movie\\, I was now watching some very good special effects\\, a great performance by Mark Hamill and what appeared to be some out of place comic sketches taken straight from the pages of Monty Python involving some creatures who are considered caretakers for an island. But I was not watching a Star Wars film anymore.\\n\\nThe film is far from bad - I particularly liked Oscar Isaac's assumption of the Han Solo mantle and Daisy Ridley's neo-Luke Skywalker positioning. I even liked Laura Dern's character\\, which seems to be an unfashionable opinion at the moment. All this said\\, it is certainly around 30 minutes too long and by about he two hour mark I found myself saying \\\"oh no\\, not again\\\" as action fatigue set in with yet another chase \/ space battle \/ hand to hand duel.\\n\\nOverall\\, well it's more than fair to say It's no Empire Strikes Back\\, but it's no Phantom Menace either. Another solid entry. Roll on Episode Nine.","true":true}
