Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far and away the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, perhaps one of the worst sci-if space epics ever put to the screen.  Rian Johnson has\\, single-handed\\, destroyed the essence of Star Wars.  Disney\\, rest assured\\, I will never ever hand over the price of admission for any project involving Rian Johnson. If you want to see a sequel that honors the original source material and provides continuity but pushes toward new and refreshing storytelling then go see Blade Runner. \\n\\nI will not see IX\\, no point.  All the interesting characters were killed off\\, the antagonist is a troubled teenager that throws temper tantrums and the protagonist is a Mary Sue.  There is nothing more interesting to see here move along move along.","true":true}
