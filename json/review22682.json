Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many SciFi greats. The second movie tops the first (ie Aliens\\, Empire Strikes Back\\, Terminator 2\\, Wrath of Khan) Epic movie. Lots of surprises & plot twist to keep you at the edge of your seat. This is Star Wars at its best. I would watch this over again and again and again.","true":true}
