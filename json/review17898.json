Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has never been more obvious that Disney has control over rotten tomatoes. I mean\\, audience score for Justice League is 80% but \\\"critics\/disney\\\" reviews give it below 40%. Star Wars\/Disney movie gets a low scoring from us but Rotten tomatoes gives it high 90%. Are you kidding me? Be unbiased\\, The last jedi is not worth your money or mine. This movie doesn't make any sense\\, a lot of scenes don't make sense\\, and they use Mark Hamill as some disposable\\, meaningless character. Jar Jar binks had a more important role in the prequels than Mark Hamill did here. Blah\\, don't see it. Just wait for redbox or netflix.","true":true}
