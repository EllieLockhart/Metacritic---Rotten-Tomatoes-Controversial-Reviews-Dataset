Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will skip another Star Wars films\\, this is just not my type of films anymore. Can't stand the holes in the story\\, lack of skill and plan and that everything is a matter of luck and nothing more. Ray... Ray is now a last Jedi who knows everything without a training - why bother to see what's next? She wins\\, nothing surprising.","true":true}
