Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was awful\\, nothing but talentless actors and force SJW sub-plots that go nowhere. If your a weak skinny jeans wearing loser that thinks the closest thing to a moral compass is seeing everyone as a \\\"NAZI\\\" and fighting for pedo rights\\, this movie is for you. But if you are a straight white male with self-worth and actully have dignaty for yourself you should ster clear of this cultral Marxist propaagda.","true":true}
