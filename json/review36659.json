Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is incredibly dynamic\\, both is story telling and in cinematography. The story pays homage to the original trilogy of starwars while giving space for new cast members to grow\\, and still delivering a wholistic and new Star Wars movie. Plus Kylo Rens fully developed and rounded character is one of the best developed characters I've seen in a long time for movies.","true":true}
