Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really dissapointed with this movie. The pacing is very unbalanced. Major plot points are left with absolutely no explanation. Too much focus on cute critters that don't add anything to the story. Poor character development with a real sarcastic tone throughout. The whole thing seemed out of control and tied together with a bunch of star wars references\\, never bringing anything unique to the franchise. An inauthentic parody. ?","true":true}
