Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really love it! It was so refreshing to see some of the ways the old rules of Star Wars were pushed forwards. Maybe some people had a problem with that but I found it very interesting and certainly not stale. No series will do well if it just makes the same movies again and again\\, the story had to go forwards and change in some ways and I thought it was done very bravely. This is definitely not a perfect film. There are some moments (some jokes and unexpected romantic confessions) that I thought were kind of out of place. Some parts of the plot felt disjointed and I was disappointed that certain ideas were explored and then abandoned at the end (wish I could be more specific but spoilers!) However my overall impression was that it was an exciting\\, thought provoking\\, entertaining and certainly FEARLESS new chapter for the new generation which I really appreciated.","true":true}
