Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When the force awakens was released I went to see it in theatre a dozen times. I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie but it was watchable. \\n\\nWith this movie once is enough. There are good points in the movie but the experience as a whole is a let down. \\n\\nThe dialogue is written as thou it took place on earth. Every scene was rushed with no time to settle into the story. \\n\\nI won't be wasting another cent on this movie.","true":true}
