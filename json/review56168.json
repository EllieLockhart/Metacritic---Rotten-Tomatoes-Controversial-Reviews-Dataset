Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead to me.... this is such a slap in the face of all the story lines set up by JJ and characters built over 40 years....a Star Wars with no light saber battle? Killing off the bad guy with no story? What they did to Luke is indescribable we wait 40 years and you give us this BS story Luke was never coward but that what you make of him? You could have sent him off dying in an epic duel with Kylo. Screw you Rian and Disney....Lea floating through space? Wow just wow....oh now you can weaponize a space craft and sucide? Why didn't they just do that to all the Death Stars before it? Duh...you can't just add something so crazy 8 films in. What a shame... this should have been epic. I don't plan on giving another dollar to Disney...","true":true}
