Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plotholes\\, Rey is boring and I am not feeling any tension within the movie\\, I watched the awakened movie and this one when it came out and I will watch the rise coming out in December but this is a punch into the face. Why did Holdo did the Kamikaze\\, is there noone in the histroy of FTL travel that thought of that before? Why did they even bother bulding a deathstar if you can destroy it with a simple cruiser...just FTL it into it... it is TOTAL BS. ","true":true}
