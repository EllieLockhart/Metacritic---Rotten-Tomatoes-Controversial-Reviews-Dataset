Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney continues to ruin Star Wars\\, the same thing happened with the previous movie TFA\\, and the same garbage they made with this second TLJ. \\nA lot of money spent on visuals but the story that is the most important aspect\\, is very mediocre in these new Disney's Star Wars movies.\\n\\nThe first movie TFA was completely a copy and paste of the EpIV\\, with the difference of this new story is totally mediocre\\, and the acting of that new african-british actor that played the character Finn\\, was horrible to bear\\, OMG that was the most terrible acting ever.\\nThis second movie TLJ is the same\\, good visuals\\, horrible acting (by the same african-british actor) and terrible story. \\nRey turned out to be a nobody\\, Snoke another nobody and dies too soon without any good history connected with ancient sith\\, and Luke dies without any good combat or anything\\, in a none spectacular way.. \\nThe only interesting thing about these new films is the character Kylo Ren and his story.","true":true}
