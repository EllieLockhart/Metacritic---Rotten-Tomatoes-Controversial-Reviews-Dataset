{"101487":110835,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bottom line: Wait for home release\\, if you must watch it at all. The next decade of Star Wars main storyline is doomed due to Rian Johnson's baffling premature assignment.\\n\\nThis film is horrifically boring\\, disrespectful to it's source material\\, painfully pedantic to hollow philosophy\\, and without any discernable heart for what makes Star Wars special. The flippant way the characters are handled distracts from the experience all the way to the end of the film. The humor is out of place and falls flat (George Lucas' prequel fart jokes we're funnier). I'm pretty sure the director was urinating on the fan base with that Leia scene (yes\\, you know the one) and the 'out of range' in a vacuum farce. Johnson completely disrespects everything Abrams built in Force Awakens\\, destroying great characters and interesting questions. Mark Hamil gives a stellar performance even as Johnson tanks the character into tit-suckling\\, Skype-kamakazi Yogi. Yoda's awkward appearance gives us Johnson's patricidal philosophy that rejects the filial piety that infused earlier Star Wars source material\\, which is the same philosophy he gives Kylo Ren's character: we only have our identity insofar as we progress beyond our predecessors. As Yoda torches the Jedi sacred texts\\, so Rian throws the Star Wars series into this bonfire of a catastrophe. \\n\\nFinally\\, a word about the critics. The universal critical acclaim for this movie is utter malpractice. There is no galaxy in which the pacing of this movie is acceptable\\, even if you agree with Johnson's subversive strategy (I get it critics\\, you go to a lot of movies and you are tired of Joseph Campbell's archetypes). The movie slowly meanders from empty motivation to empty motivation before giving us an empty hologram that disappears. You failed to assess this. Additionally\\, even though you may resent the Star Wars fandom for its enthusiasm and tradition\\, you should have the intellectual imagination to note that fans of the source material would be put off by what Johnson has done. I don't know if it's the big party\\, the media ownership reach\\, or the sub-par education the opulent years if the US gave us\\, but something force-skyped the brains of our critics to turn them off when reviewing this film. Congratulations Disney\\, it worked: I wasted $80 on this film. I won't make that mistake again for anything with Rian Johnson's influence on it.","true":true}
