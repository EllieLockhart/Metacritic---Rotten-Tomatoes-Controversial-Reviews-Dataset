Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi does a lot of things amazingly right\\, and a few things very wrong. We left Star Wars: The Force Awakens feeling excited for more Star Wars\\, but longing for something different. The Last Jedi delivers on that with a groundbreaking new direction for a Star Wars film. Sure\\, it has many speed bumps and hiccups along the way\\, but it will definitely be remembered as a Star Wars movie that changed the franchise. Whether for better or worse\\, only time will tell.","true":true}
