Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What really hit the critics with a bulls eye but went completely over the heads of the audience was the moral of the movie. It's not about destroying what you hate\\, but saving what loved ones you have left. Really\\, this moral is the fundamental base of this movie\\, and really\\, the audience found this movie to be pretty bad\\, because they just couldn't see how the complex yet amazing plot wraps around the moral of the story comfortably. Also\\, the last Jedi swings the old plots from a new hope\\, but changing it around as well. Look at it\\, you have a force sensitive person that meets someone to train them to help fight against an evil force hell bent on destroying them. Just like Kenobi\\, Luke Skywalker went to become one with the force. I wouldn't be surprised if they pull off more force communication between Rey and Luke in the rise of Skywalker. Honestly\\, I stand firmly with the fact that this was a good movie\\, and I hope Star Wars could still find a place in many people's hearts.","true":true}
