Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The other reviewers have already said it all.  This was like a parody of a Star Wars film and after 20 minutes I thought I was part of a hidden camera show where they were showing a spoof movie to watch the audience reaction.  Not only is it a terrible movie and a insult to the fans but it's just a baffling business decision.  Who signed off on a script that deliberately sets out to make the viewer wonder why they ever cared about the franchise in the first place?  They paid billions for the IP because it came with millions of fans willing to buy tickets\/merchandise and then deliberately ruined the goodwill built up in the previous movies.\\nI can understand people who watch these movies the same way I watch a Fast and Furious movie\\, (i.e. with my brain switched off but enjoying watching the shiny cars and explosions) wondering what all the fuss is about but the fans who have been invested in this universe for 40 years will now be questioning why they bothered.\\nA Star Wars movie used to be an unmissable event at the cinema but this is the last one I'll watch there.\\nThe other thing that bugged me was the way the critics just flat out lied about this film.  Reviews for the next film could be glowing but I just won't believe them.  The only person to come out of this with any dignity intact is Mark Hamill who not only did his best in the film but also had the balls to slag off this God awful nonsense","true":true}
