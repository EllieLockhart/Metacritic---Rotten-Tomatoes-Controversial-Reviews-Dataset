Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. The story is truly about Kylo Ren and Rey. So excited to see where this goes. I loved how this movie got in to the force and was the most cerebral of all the Star Wars. Polarizing because some are not going to like that there are traditional Star Wars rules that are broken. But that's what I loved about it. It was bold\\, new\\, and fresh.","true":true}
