Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am also someone who signed up with this site just to write a review. How this movie currently has 93% is beyond my comprehension. Pointless and boring new characters\\, clunky and often cringe worthy dialogue\\, odd pacing in many places and almost NOTHING new to offer. The great majority of the action was recycled from previous movies. If I have to see another scene with our heroes dressing up as the enemy to sneak on board their ship I will be making a scene of my own in the movie theater. There were many moments in this movie like this where I wanted to walk out. It's like Disney and Johnson tried to recreate many set pieces as to ensure there are enough Star Warsy elements present to keep fans satisfied. As a hard core Star Wars fan this has the opposite effect\\, as I feel insulted by this. My biggest draw to Star Wars is being transported to new and exciting worlds\\, to see original characters\\, places and situations. At this point the makers of these movies want to ensure they reproduce and already written and established formula\\, and their approach to taking chances are to create unexpected turns and twists with plot and characters. The biggest casualty of this is Luke Skywalker\\, what they turned his character into spits in the face of what I feel Luke would never\\, ever become. If you see this movie\\, PLEASE see a matinee or wait for it on DVD if you can. Such a wasted opportunity.","true":true}
