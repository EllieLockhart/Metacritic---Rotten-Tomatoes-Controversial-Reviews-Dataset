Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is not only enjoyable\\, but impressively well done with a combination of new and classic Star Wars. I am happy they took the gamble on many decisions\\, even if it was divisive for this movie\\, will hopefully pay off in the future. Also\\, there were phenomenal performances by Adam Driver and Mark Hamill. As a movie fan and a Star Wars fan\\, I was very satisfied with the movie and I am excited for the future of this story.","true":true}
