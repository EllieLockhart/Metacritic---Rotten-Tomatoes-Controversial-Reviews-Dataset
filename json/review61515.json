We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It is hard to rate this game. The Last of Us is a legend\\, but this sequel makes you forget about it. When 7 years ago it was announced\\, we all hoped for something groundbreaking. Unfortunately\\, cult around Neil Druckmann's writing was wrong (including me). This game is beautiful\\, not Red Dead Redemption level of graphics\\, but it's amazing (what's funny\\, Uncharted 4 looks very similar). Gameplay is the same old game with newer animations\\, which is good if you love the first one. But the story\\, oh boy\\, the story. Killing Joel right on the beginning without any respect was the worst decision of the franchise. Models we're swapped\\, Joel from trailerS was replaced by Jesse. Joel in some scenes was replaced by young Joel\\, so he was not part od the story\\, this was just a flashback scene. And the worst... Game forces you to play as Joel's killer for almost 12 hours. Writing is cheap\\, full of plotholes. No one had a problem with Ellie being gay. Left Behind has great reviews. But Naughty Dog tries to tell people if they do not like this game\\, that means they are bigots. They made mistake\\, an enormous one\\, but they will not admit it. Franchise ruined.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
