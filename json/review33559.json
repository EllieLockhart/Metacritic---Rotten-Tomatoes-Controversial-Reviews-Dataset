Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film that is so wracked with partisan political messaging\\, the plot and story are fundamentally undermined and immersive engagement is destroyed. Unsubtle propaganda via unnecassary characters\\, Military incompetence\\, tone innapropriate gags\\, destroying the groundedness of Force ability via things like Leia Poppins. The one positive element that comes to mind is that unlike Prequel Trilogy and Hobbit films for example\\, they are finding the right balance between Practical Effects and CGI and some of the Cinematography is amazing.","true":true}
