Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the corner stone for misuse of CGI and the perfect demonstartion for how children reimagine old Star Wars movies at playtime. For Disney to offer Rian Johnson a contract for a new trilogy is utter suicide. Nostalgia plays a big part for any positive reviews of this movie\\, and sooner or later the oversplash of CGI on a run down canvas will destroy a saga that has no hope in the hands of such incompetent producers and directors.\\n\\nOld blood is needed to revive a failing dynasty being watched theough a pair of nostalgia spectacles. Stale acting\\, lacklustre direction and half arsed sfx denied this movie what it could have been. The Force Awakens was a great movie but ultimately a betrayal of characters in the Last Jedi let down not just the fans\\, but a story that cannot be resurrected. \\n\\nNo one watches a star wars movie with excitement anymore. Ticket sales are hought out of curioisty and curioisty only lasts so long.","true":true}
