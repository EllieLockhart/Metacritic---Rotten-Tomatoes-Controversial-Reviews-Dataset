Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything with Rey\\,Luke\\, and Kylo was great. But everything else is either only ok or drags. Snoke was also a disappointment and going into episode 9 you only care about two characters.","true":true}
