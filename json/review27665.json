Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Parts of the story seemed rushed\\, parts ignored\\,  and parts unrealistic\\, but it is a sci-fi movie and not a study in the scientific journal.  Enjoy the movie for what it is.  Certainly no Rogue 1 or Empire\\, but it is not the disaster that Phantom was either.\\n\\nSolid film that could have used more time on some story lines and less on others.","true":true}
