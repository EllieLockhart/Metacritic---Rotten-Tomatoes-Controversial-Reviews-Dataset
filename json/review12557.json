Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe the screwed this one up. Watching The Last Jedi is like watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best not to ruin the franchise by watch TLJ","true":true}
