Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Starwars geek since I was a little kid.  I feel like the plot of this entire movie was to market new characters and help Disney sell more merchandise.   It's no longer about the story its all about money$$\\, and if you think this is going to be anything better then the prequels or the original trilogy you will be disappointed. Ryan trashed Luke Skywalker's character so it would be easier to kill him off. Leia turns into space Marry Poppins.  Finn and Rose go on a pointless adventure that takes about 25 to 30 minutes that i'm pretty sure is just there to encourage an animal rights movement? You can tell this is a Disney flick by the stupid and unnecessary humor\\, the Trilogy has been dead since the Force Awakens.  I thought there might be hope this movie\\, but like Obiwan once said.  \\\"I was wrong\\\"","true":true}
