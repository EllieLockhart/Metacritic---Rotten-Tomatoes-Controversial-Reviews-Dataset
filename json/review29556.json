Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson Missed out on a huge opportunity to take the Star Wars saga to Great places . Instead he decided to get cute with the whole let the past die bullshit . He disrespected the fans and the history of Star Wars itself . The way he treated Lukes passing \\, The Leia floating thru space scene \\, Rey's Lineage & Snoke was just awful . Thank You for killing my childhood & taking away my dreams for a spectacular film that could have been . Makes me miss George Lucas and his vision","true":true}
