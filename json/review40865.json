Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie consisted of Rian Johnson trying to make the Star Wars franchise his\\, Disney really let this get out of hand. The whole film is a bunch of plot shifts\\, boring moments\\, and just scenes that never should've been included for time sake. Start off with Finn and Rose\\, going to the casino planet and get immediately thrown in prison over a Parking Ticket! like come on let's waste 30 minutes over a Parking ticket. it get the right guy then he ends up turning on you. ( sorry spoilers) next The way they perceived Luke Skywalker as an old grumpy shut out from the force having suicidal man\\, having him fight AS A FORCE PHANTOM\\, THAT SOME HOW MANAGED TO KILL HIM. He's a damn Jedi master of 40+ years. That can pass into the force that one thing wouldn't end him. Rian Johnson better be removed as the directer for the next trilogy. I'll end my rant here.","true":true}
