Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On first watch\\, I enjoyed the movie. A few people clapped at the end\\, and I went home and thinking about what I enjoyed. I went to see it a second time\\, and it felt like a drag. It was very long\\, and since I already knew what was coming\\, I had time to analyze the actual story and plot. This led me to fully understand the controversy happening with the movie. Albeit there were some decent moments in this film\\, the majority is heavily flawed when you take time to digest what you've seen. For most movies you would just give it your first rating and be done\\, however this is Star Wars\\, and it should be held at a higher standard. There is no need to talk about the issues with the movie\\, as there are many\\, but instead ask the question of what they will do for future films\\, as their choices in this has led it to be very concerning rather than something to look forward to.","true":true}
