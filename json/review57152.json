Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not your grandfather's Star Wars. There's a lot of Disney\\, there are more jokes than before\\, but its still Star Wars. Its Star Wars for the next 40 years\\, not the last 40 years. There are reveals and there are more questions. It was fantastic and spectacular. If the opening scroll always gives you goosebumps when the horns start blowing\\, you're going to love it. This is the new Star Wars!","true":true}
