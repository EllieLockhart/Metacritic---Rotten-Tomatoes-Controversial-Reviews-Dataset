Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script is an insult to competent working\\, to everything Star Wars and to decent writing. A humiliating joke\\, Disney should suck the milk of seals for this not Luke. This is beyond worse\\, to fix this they would need top make it just a bad dream and just ignore it and start over. I will never set foot in another Star Wars cinema screening only to have my intellect and childhood humiliated. As shocking it was for Mark as shocking it is for us. Disney is an evil empire who should be destroyed and boycotted.","true":true}
