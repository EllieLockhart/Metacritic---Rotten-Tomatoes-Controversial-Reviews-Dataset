It repeats 1 part like killing crucial character. No doubt Joel deserved be dead considering what he's done to people before but the fact that he and Tommy told unknown people their names so easily makes me sad. The whole story of Abby is garbage as for me. The only thing you want all the game is to kill her but the game tries to change your ming unsuccessfully. She kills her ex-mates for Lev so easily and without a doubt like a butcher. There is a long break between 2 story lines of Ellie and Abby so can loose the story line. They should have mixed chapters or show Abby's story before Joel's death so we can understand her feelings and actions. However we just want to kill Abby as fast as we can. That's why people confused about the epilog when Ellie decides to let Abby go. We just can't take it. Well in my mind it should be 2 dialogue phrases to choose for Ellie talking with Joel in the night. The first means she won't forgive him and all of the well-known thing happen and the second phrase ( unlocks after passing unlucky ending perhaps) whe she forgives him and they go together nex morning in patrol (happy ending). This would be the logical continuation of the last of us part 1. I'm very sad about what I've seen. Like separate game it's OK but considering 1 part it's total garbage in terms of the story and how it failed...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
