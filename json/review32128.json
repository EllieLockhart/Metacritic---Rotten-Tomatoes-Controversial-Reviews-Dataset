Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: This won't go the way you think it will... The you tube theories didn't play out\\, and people had invested a lot in those. Well\\, that's the trouble with speculation. The only niggle I had with the film was Leia in space moment. I've watched it a second time and think this was leia's latent\/dormant forces powers coming out with a mind of their own. Still a niggle though! Gutted at the end too\\, but thats not the films fault!","true":true}
