Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may be the worst Star Wars film ever made (besides maybe Episode II). Riddled with plot holes. Edgy and packed with narrative twists just for the sake of being \\\"unexpected.\\\" Character arcs veer off the rails. The writing in this film is truly\\, objectively awful and a disservice to the Star Wars legacy. Maybe if Johnson would've had original characters to work with and not wedged this mess in the middle of a trilogy\\, it could've worked out better. Positive critic reviews for this film must be written merely to spite the fandom\\, because even the most pretentious contrarian critic shouldn't be able to stomach this turd in good faith.","true":true}
