Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly plotted and paced. All the new and some of the old characters are throwaways. Characterizations are inconsistent. There is an entire subplot that could be removed from TLJ\\, and no one would miss it. The character development in The Force Awakens that made it more than just fan service is mostly absent here. There is nothing memorable about this movie other than a few visuals...not the story\\, characters or even the new music themes. I gave it 2.5 stars\\, and if it wasn't Star Wars I would have scored it even lower.","true":true}
