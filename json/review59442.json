Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"En todos los aspectos impecable salvo en la historia la cual no es tan impactante como como el 1 (no digo que sea mala pero no esta a la altura de la primera parte) los motivos de cada PJ los considero cre\u00edbles\\, simpatice con Lev y Abby sobre todo por perdonar a Ellie y Dina\\, llegando al final se fuerza un poco por alargar el juego mas no puedo mentir que si lo disfrute como un peque\u00f1o DLC y el hecho de que Ellie se de la tremenda molestia para terminar dejando ir a Abby me gusto\\, sobre todo porque al igual que el 1 fue un tremendo viaje que no termino cumpliendo el objetivo inicial\\, para finalizar que Ellie termine sola por culpa de su sed de venganza me parece perfecto.\rSino te gusto estas en todo tu derecho a mi no me gusta fornite o gta no por eso son malos juegos simplemente no te gustaron y ya esta\\, no olvides son juegos su objetivo es que te entretengan y lo pases bien y the last of us part II lo logro conmigo.\r\rIn every aspect impeccable except for the story which is not as shocking as 1 (I am not saying that it is bad but it is not up to the first part) the reasons for each PC consider them credible\\, sympathize with Lev and Abby especially for forgiving Ellie and Dina\\, coming to the end she forces herself a little bit to lengthen the game but I can't lie that if I enjoyed it as a little DLC and the fact that Ellie went to the extreme trouble to end up letting Abby go I like it\\, especially because like 1 it was a tremendous journey that did not end up fulfilling the initial objective\\, to finish that Ellie ends up alone because of her thirst for revenge seems perfect to me.\rIf you do not like you are in your right I do not like fornite or gta not for that reason they are bad games you just did not like and this is it\\, do not forget they are games their objective is to entertain you and have a good time and the last of us part II did it with me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
