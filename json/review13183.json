Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t see what everyone has wrong with this movie\\, it was awesome\\, everything was done very well\\, and the visuals were insane\\, it gives me a good feeling on what to come","true":true}
