Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, while having some of the best Star Wars scenes ever\\, fails as a whole. There are some plot points that are unnecessary and some that also feel like a slap in the face to the potential that this trilogy arc could have been. I am very disappointed in the direction Rian Johnson chose to go\\, and vigorously hope that this movie is just a set up for a greater reveal in episode 9. I hope in a few years we can look back at this movie and say\\, \\\"that was a great set up\\\". But until then\\, this movie is not great.","true":true}
