Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn't all bad I just found the Plot holes and poor writing to be very detracting from the amazing cinematic effects. I believe this movie will go down as a missed opportunity rather than a good film. Good try but poorly executed.","true":true}
