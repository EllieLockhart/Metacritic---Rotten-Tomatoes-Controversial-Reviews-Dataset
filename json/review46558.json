{"101487":194022,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching The Last Jedi was an insulting and\\, at times\\, even a horrifying experience.  No plot to speak of...ok...maybe you could call it a plot but it was so poorly conceived that you could probably get a better script from 80-90% of the humans currently populating the Earth.  Insane editing.  Wooden\\, wonky acting.  Themeless score (with the exception of themes dredged from the class scores).  Character development that went nowhere.  Crappy\\, too busy special effects.  Off kilter pacing.  And a constant stream of wacked-out\\, inappropriate humor that might even make Jar Jar Binks cringe.\\n\\nThis thing was a train wreck that I still can't believe actually happened and I'm even more puzzled by the media and press response around this thing.  Disney must have a lot of cash to push around the table.  This thing is WACKED OUT CRAZY BAD.\\n\\nBut it wasn't just a bad movie...it was as if Disney wanted to \\\"kill the past\\\".  Get it? Get it? Get it? Holy Jesus...where is the logic? What do you get as a result?  Let us explore this: you spend no time developing new characters\\, recycle old plot lines\\, take the Star Wars universe nowhere new\\, and THEN step-by-step you systematically kill off the old characters and\\, while you're at it\\, ensure that they meet tragic ends.  So what am I to make of this?  When I watch the old films now\\, I will just chuckle to myself: \\n\\n\\\"Nice try\\, Solo...you may have attempted to redeem yourself in A New Hope but\\, guess what?\\, you die in the end\\, and it SUCKS bro!\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Luke...my man\\, you are doing the best you can in ROTJ...I get it.  But bro\\, you are going to fuck up big time later leading to the deaths of millions if not billions of people! It's some woke shit because male privilege just makes you think you are a badass\\, bro.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Leia...my lovely\\, tough as nails\\, Leia.  You might think you're ready for what's coming and you held up under extreme pressure in Empire but we're going to break you later.  You end up busted up and sad...with everyone you know dead...and not just on Alderaan if you get what I'm saying!\\\"\\n\\nThank you Disney\\, Rian Johnson\\, and whoever the fuck else basically retroactively destroyed the hopeful happy endings of the original trilogy.  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU ASSHATS?!?!?\\n\\nI am still in shock at what we now have on hand after The Force Awakens and this steaming pile of shit.  \\n\\nIt's just chaos...garbage...completely confused storytelling\\, nary a quiet moment to reflect\\, not a single normal\\, human conversation between two characters (see if you can find one that lasts longer than 10 seconds)  and total destruction of everything that made the original movies so great. It seemed as though there was a desire to completely dismantle the entire Star Wars universe...whose heart lays squarely in the collective hands of Luke Skywalker\\, Princess Leia\\, and Han Solo along w\/ a little help from a lot of good friends.  All to be replaced by a bunch of wooden\\, cardboard characters with no development\\, no past\\, and no future. \\n\\nEven John Williams is not buying this bullshit...give me one single interesting theme developed as a result of these films?  None are allowed to develop\\, no significant structured scoring...it's just all jabs and brassy braying.  John is clearly not interested in this chaotic mess.\\n\\nI hate to admit that I'm such an old nerd but I remember the original films and can still look at them with some degree of objectivity for what they really are: simple\\, grounded tales of adventure\\, heroism\\, and hope. Star Wars asked you to believe in something good\\, and it suggested that perhaps there were mysteries of considerable vastness out there...but\\, in the end\\, it came down to family\\, friends\\, love\\, human connection...not the sci-fi version of the Keystone Cops.\\n\\nSo\\, obviously\\, you can trash me...go ahead...my interpretation of Star Wars is subjective and very likely biased to my own experience\\, but I would argue that the films - the classic films - united people around a series of sincere and powerful symbolic stories that resonated with people.  At least it gave kids in the 70s something useful to hang on to in the face of horrible\\, horrible sh*t we were just getting our heads around.  Star Wars wasn't perfect but it tried to get a few key messages across: Don't give in to hate.  Don't overestimate your own abilities.  Be patient.  Believe...and the Force will be with you...always.\\n\\n Now\\, in the era of Trump...we have this bullshit.\\n\\nKill the past?  No\\, man...it's time: Kill Star Wars.","true":true}
