I have completed about 20% of the game and I'm over 35 hours into it\\, there's so much to do. Here's just a few of the things you need to do to 100% the game's completion log:\r- Eat everything at every restaurant in Sotenbori and Kamurocho\r- Spend\\, get and invest over 1\\,000\\,000\\,000 yen\r- Complete the 100 substories\\, there are 40 for Majima and 60 for Kiryu\r- Collect every telephone card on the map to befriend Mr Libido\r- Go to a telephone club and befriend three girls\r- Travel 100 km by foot (trust me\\, it takes way longer than you think\\, after over 35 hours of almost only walking around doing side stuff\\, I have yet to pass 50 km)\r- Defeat 200 enemies in the 6 different fighting styles (3 for Kiryu\\, 3 for Majima)\rAnd all of that isn't even close to everything. Some examples of especially great subquest from where I am at is:\r- Producing a tv show without knowing anything about producing\r- Helping a dominatrix get better at her job\r- Speaking through a portable phone (again\\, trust me\\, it's harder than you'd think)\r- Defeat a huge guy who\\, if you don't defeat him which is very likely you don't\\, will steal all the money you currently have on you\r- Helping a hardcore band be actually hardcore (this one's probably my favorite of all of them so far)\r- Going full real estate\\, buying buildings\\, collecting money\\, hiring staff\\, all while trying to get a hold of\rKamurocho from The Five Billiionaires\r- Helping a kid get an adult mag while other people are watching\rAnd just to top it off\\, the best features of the game:\r- A fantastic story with fantastic pacing\r- Fantastically written characters\r- Tons of side content to do after you're done with the story\\, though I highly suggest people do them as they play the story\r- Amazing simple to learn\\, hard to master combat\r- Memorable layouts of the open worlds\r- Some of the best villains in any game period\r- Fantastic controls\r- Fantastic soundtrack (especially Judgement) and sound design\\, and finally...\r- THE ABILITY TO PAUSE A CUTSCENE WITHOUT SKIPPING IT!\r10\/10. That's what the game gets\\, and it gets what it deserves. The only games that even come close to rivaling it for me is Persona 5\\, Psychonauts and Dark Souls\\, but even they struggle. It is just a pure gaming masterpiece\\, and a PERFECT introduction to any series. I can't wait to move on to the other games after I finish it\\, but I will take it slow and try to do as much as possible in this game before going over to Kiwami.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
