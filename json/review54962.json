Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a fun ride and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Maybe missed some opportunities with Luke\\, but I loved all the character missions and thought the next movie was set up well. My son said the jump-to-lightspeed crash scene was the best thing he's seen in a sci-fi movie :) I was just sad it didn't come sooner\\, before so many already died -- but they had to go\\, it was a good storyline :)","true":true}
