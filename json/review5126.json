Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cultural and gender issues aside (there were many and they were awful)\\, this movie was horrible. If you approach it as a fan of the franchise\\, you will be disappointed not by the lack of content from characters from the original 3 movies\\, but by their completely disconnected storylines from the original. If you approach it as a fan of theatre and story\\, you will be disappointed by the glaring holes\\, lack of depth or creativity of story or quality directing\\, and disjointed\/over-developed side stories. There is no great drama\\, there are no depth of characters\\, so no one to feel attached to. The only redeeming aspect of the movie\\, and why it deserves 1\/2 star over zero\\, is some strong acting by Mark Hamill and some as-expected great special effects. Everything that was right about Rogue One was wrong in this film. This franchise is off the rails\\, but hey\\, it's making loads of money so who cares (that's what Disney Cinema is all about anyway). Like the dark side\\, I get pulled in by some mysterious Force that causes me to fork over way too much money for a sub-par film. And like the Resistance\\, I guess I always have hope for the future. At this point\\, I don't know why.","true":true}
