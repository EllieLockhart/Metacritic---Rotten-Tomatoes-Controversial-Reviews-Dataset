{"101487":175052,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-10-07","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi goes completely nowhere and leaves plot holes the force awakens left us to be un-answered or just down right abandoned. The part where snoke died\\, having known little to absolutely nothing about him killed all the expectations fans had come to expect. The Luke skywalker that we all grew to understand didn't feel or act like Luke at all. The reveal of Rey's backstory was very cliche\\, just plain disappointing and makes her a very boring character to know. I hope Disney gets there act together and understand what the fans want to see and come to expect in a high budget film.","true":true}
