Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a galaxy far far away\\, Mickey Mouse was proclaimed the new Sith Lord of the evil Disney empire. His mission is to destroy the Star Wars legacy once and for all. The evil emperor appointed his mindless minion\\, Rian Johnson\\, with the task of destroying everything you loved from the saga.
