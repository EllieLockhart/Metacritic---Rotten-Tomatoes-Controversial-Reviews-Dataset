{"101487":142867,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to believe that some of these reviews are labeling 'The Last Jedi' as the \\\"worst Star Wars they've ever seen.\\\" \\nThis is why the Star Wars fanbase has been labeled multiple times the worst or most toxic movie fanbase ever. And I'd have to agree with that. They don't know what they want. \\\"THE PREQUELS SUCK\\, GIVE US THE OT.\\\"\\nWe get Force Awakens; \\\"THIS IS JUST A BLAND COPY OF THE OT GIVE US ORIGINALITY.\\\" \\nThe Last Jedi gives us this originality. Sure\\, some scenes are undeniably inspired by the past movies. Now\\, let me address somethings (SPOILERS)\\n1) Lukes personality has been bashed by fans and even Mark Hamill himself. I see why\\, but you need to look at it like this; Luke has seen some shit and has been through some shit\\, and when he finds out that one of his own students will be worse than Darth Vader\\, you can only guess that he is thinking of all the people who will die unless he does something. Notice he resents what he did the moment he pulled out the lightsaber to Bens' neck.\\nWho wouldn't feel depressed after this\\, add on the fact that all his students were killed?\\n2) Ray is a Mary Sue. That's unfair to say until we get Episode 9. At this point in time\\, yeah\\, sort of. But until we round up this trilogy\\, we can't say that for certain.\\nThis movie is great. Action\\, Plot\\, Characters\\, all excellent. The only things i have issues with are Snoke's death and the whole 'Finn and Rose' side-story.It was shit\\, and used up a whole ton of movie screen time. We didn't learn anything about Snoke in both of these movies\\, and he just dies? Sure it was an epic moment\\, but what was the point of Snoke?\\nAnyway\\, please watch this movie\\, and if any one calls you out on not being intellectual enough to see the movie is bad\\, stuff 'em.","true":true}
