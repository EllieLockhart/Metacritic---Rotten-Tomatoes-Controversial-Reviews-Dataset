Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very cheesy film. terrible acting. plots that didnt make sense. slap stick humor. actually bored during this film and most bad action movies don't cause me to be bored. kylo ren looks so awkward w his light saber","true":true}
