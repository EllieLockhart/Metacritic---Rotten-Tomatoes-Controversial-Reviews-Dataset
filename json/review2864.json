Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful Story telling with no respect for the source material. Rian Johnson didn't know what do with the characters and doesn't know how to tell a story. Finn and Rose could be deleted from the movie and wouldn't be missed. Every time Johnson got stuck\\, he just had the characters use the force. Most of the time\\, this was with no basis in how the Force was used in earlier movies. Luke goes out with a fizzle. If you loved he franchise you will be disappointed.","true":true}
