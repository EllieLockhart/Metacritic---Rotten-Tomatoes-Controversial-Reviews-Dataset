Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this movie isn't the \\\"changes\\\" that Johnson implements\\, it's the lack of response from the characters to the events and the world around them. If the rules in the universe change\\, if Leia can fly through space now that should be exciting instead\\, no character even mentions or reacts to witnessing any of these force miracles making them feel unremarkable or just a frustrating rebuke of the established world that the characters exists in.","true":true}
