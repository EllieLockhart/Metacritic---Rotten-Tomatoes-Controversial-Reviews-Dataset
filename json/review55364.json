Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED it. Can't stop thinking about it. By far the most spiritual Star Wars film in its approach to the Force and what this means in relation to surrendering\\, accepting and non-resistance. I totally understand why people would have a problem with some of the decisions made but I feel like every single choice served the characters faithfully and took Star Wars into new and uncharted territory. I believe it will only get better after subsequent viewings.","true":true}
