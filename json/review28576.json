Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the most original Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back. It's also completely different from The Empire Strikes Back. It is also the funniest Star Wars with the most twists. You will enjoy","true":true}
