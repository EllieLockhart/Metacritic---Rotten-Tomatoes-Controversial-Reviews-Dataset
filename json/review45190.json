Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike other star wars films\\, the last jedi does something different and that leaving the audience not knowing if a character will make it\\, the scope and depth of this film is simply amazing. My only concern with the film is as a star wars fan it does not fill the wants i had for the film but replaces it with something i did not think i wanted but enjoyed receiving\\, the film has some amazing comedy\\, action scenes and answered a lot of questions but at the same time gave me more questions to be answered and at times felt like a filler for this new trilogy but a really well made filler. i look forward for the final film in this trilogy.","true":true}
