Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong SW fan\\, I am disappointed in the direction given to Luke.  This is not what I dreamed about as a 10 year old kid.  The whole plot of the resistance cruiser being chased while running out of gas was nonsensical.   Poe should have been thrown in the brig or shot for treason.  Finn and Rose have time to go gambling and then fight Phasma while the cruiser is getting blasted.  We find out more about Rose than Smoke?  Seriously?   Not all bad though... space battles were great.  Battle of Crait was very cool.  Mostly though\\, I wanted more... knights of ren please!  Somebody called Darth please. Luke fighting please. Smoke backstory.  Rey backstory - Not the one we got. More info on the history of the force.  Instead we got porgs and Luke milking the teats of a sea cow.","true":true}
