It this game was so good why is the score by users getting trashed and causing a huge divide in the player base.

I honestly have little faith in ND in delivering a sequel in the future. They literally murdered a beloved character and made us play as the murderer?  Really?  This was your beat decision?  I guarantee you this isn\u2019t what the customer wanted.  And what really grinds my gears is that the players that like the game say I don\u2019t have the emotional intelligence to empathize the suffering\\, story and characters.  Well\\,  it seems they don\u2019t have the emotional intelligence to empathize with the fan base that doesn\u2019t like this game and our story\\, Pain and suffering.   We all loved the first game and im pissed at playing this.  Guess they really don\u2019t have the best eq.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
