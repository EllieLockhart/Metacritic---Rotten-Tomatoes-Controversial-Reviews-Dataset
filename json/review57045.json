Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is depressing! how the critics have scored it so highly is unbelievable. The visuals are stunning\\, but that's seems to be limit of Rian Johnsons ability. The storey is riddled with plot holes everywhere\\, the characters don't develop anywhere further than the Force Awakens\\, and know one acts in a believable way. Like Leia and Holdo saying they like Poe after he kills most of the fleet and stages a mutiny? \\nFin\\, Rose and\\, Phasma are all noticeably shallow characters that could of been so much more\\, These good actors deserve so much better than this.\\nI know Starwars is based way outside the laws of reality\\, but it seems like Rey did nothing to hone the skills to be the best sword fighter and force user in the Galaxy\\, where Luke spent 3 films learning and improving slowly. Luke is also somehow transformed from the most optimistic Jedi in history that believes everyone can be saved and is willing to take on the empire alone\\, into a man who nearly murdered his nephew and wants to hide while the evil dictators take over the universe?","true":true}
