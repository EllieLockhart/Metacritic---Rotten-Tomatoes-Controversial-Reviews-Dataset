Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it\\, but at the end I as left feeling empty and disappointed. It was like a magic show where every trick is telegraphed. The tricks are flashy\\, fun. The show is exciting\\, but you know what is going to happen\\, and at the end of it all nothing of consequence happened.","true":true}
