Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. What they did with Luke and Snoke is incomprehensible. They basically killed off the two most intriguing characters and instead of adding to the mystic of Rey and Kylo they take that away as well. I'm done with Star Wars.. I should have stay home and watch Frosty the Snowman","true":true}
