Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With some of the coolest scenes in any Star Wars film to date the film is brought low with some of the worst unfunny low brow scenes in any star wars film. \\n\\nThe film also suffered from being over stuffed with confusing character actions that get hundreds killed for no reason\\, planets that are not mentioned until they are useful\\, and locations that are run through quickly without a second thought. \\n\\nThere is a good film in there somewhere but it just has too much going on to have a solid idea of what it wants to be. Is it a film about Rey\\, Luke and Kylo? Or is it a film about how Poe gets hundreds if not thousands killed because of his actions.","true":true}
