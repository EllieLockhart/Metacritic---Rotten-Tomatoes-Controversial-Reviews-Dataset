Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible excuse for a Star Wars film. I hate how they disrespect Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker character and turn Finn into a mindless goof. This franchise had so much potential\\, but fell far\\, far away into the deep void of money-grabbing space.","true":true}
