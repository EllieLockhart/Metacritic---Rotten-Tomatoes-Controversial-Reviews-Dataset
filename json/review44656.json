Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally the wrong send off for Luke. Why leave clues to find a map to find him if he doesn't want to be found?! Makes a farce of force awakwns and the original trilogy.","true":true}
