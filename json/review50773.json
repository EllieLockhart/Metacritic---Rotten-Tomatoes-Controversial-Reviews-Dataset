Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful installment in the Star Wars universe. The new characters are fresh\\, inspiring\\, and relatable. The old favorites have evolved as people with their life experiences in a way that feels realistic and believable. \\n\\nIt also gives us as viewers new insight into the Force and the balance of good and evil\\, light and dark.  We see both the universal struggle between these two sides and the individual struggle within each of the characters. Further\\, the problems that drive the story forward weren't based on the failures of the characters or coincidence\\, but because things don't always go according to plan.\\n\\nMy one complaint is that the pacing felt odd.  The story tried to cover so much ground that it sometimes felt like it hopped from scene to scene without proper transition. \\n\\nOverall\\, this movie was a genuine pleasure to watch.","true":true}
