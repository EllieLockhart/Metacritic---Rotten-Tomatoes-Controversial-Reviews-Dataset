Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly can't understand what there is not to like about this film. I've seen every star wars film\\, been a fan since I was a kid\\, and I honestly loved the last Jedi. There were  interesting unpredictable choices\\, and plot points I genuinely did not see coming. \\nThis is not a movie about the past\\, it's a movie about taking star wars into the future. \\nWhile there are definitely thematic links to episode 5\\, it is it's own story and even plays with your expectations and flips them on their heads. People have been complaining about plot holes\\, but I found the plot holes in the force awakens were far worse and that the last Jedi was a fairly solid film (without rewatching yet).\\n I'm not interested in who makes the film \\, I'm interested in the content of the film. Yes\\,  Disney have made some bad decisions\\, but I honestly forgot I was watching a Disney film\\, just for Mark Hamill's acting alone surely this is a great film. \\nI suppose only time will tell whether this film is as great as I believe it is\\, or if I'm just caught in the moment. Remember though\\, Empire Strikes Back received mixed press on it's initial release. Now it's considered one of the greatest films ever made. We'll have to wait and see what history makes of the last Jedi","true":true}
