Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars is a stretch. It's a fine fantasy \/ sci-fi movie\\, but a terrible Star Wars film. I actually appreciate the prequels much more at this point. I never dreamed that I would actually consider skipping episode ix. At this point I don't care.","true":true}
