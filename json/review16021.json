Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fan and this was by far the most disappointing movie in the Star War series. It was the worst movie but it was such a let down. I felt that Disney did a really nice job with the Force Awakens which is why I had such high expectations. This film was all over the place. The story was very segmented and was hard to follow at times. There were portions of the film that I was excited to see in a Star Wars film (Imperial Guard especially). However\\, I walked away feeling really bummed out by the let down. Thumbs down!!","true":true}
