Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should be praised just for how many risks it took as a Star Wars movie. The acting and writing in this movie is the best it has ever been. There are a couple eye roll scenes and some forced or misplaced jokes\\, but overall this Star Wars movie is more thematically rich than any other in the franchise. The twists are unexpected\\, the tropes it subverts are a pleasant surprise\\, and the ending leaves you with what the rebellion has been searching for: hope.","true":true}
