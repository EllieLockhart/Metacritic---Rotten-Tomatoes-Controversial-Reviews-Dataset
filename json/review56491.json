Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time i Saw this movie i won't lie i left the theater bummed\\, confused and to some extent mildly dissapointed\\, i like every single Star Wars movie but i wasn't sure i liked the direction they took with this one\\, it was just too much to handle at once\\, however i knew i just had to watch it again with cold eyes and a fresh perspective to fully conceive a well biased opinion and to truly know what i thought and felt towards it\\, and i must say i really enjoyed it the second time around.\\nI came to realize that from a nostalgic point of view The Last Jedi is a pretty harsh Star Wars film to digest\\, but that's also the best part of it\\, it will amplify your doubts\\, leave you wondering about what's to come and once out of the theater you'll notice you'll immediatly find yourself thinking about the whole movie itself and how it actually doesn't care what you believe and\/or think of Star Wars.\\nIt manages to go into unexpected territory when placed in familiar situations\\, defying the expectations of the viewer and thus really making it a challenge for them to acknowledge the twist and turn of events that make it a major change in the whole saga itself\\, but above most of all\\, it's fun\\, which is what a Star Wars film should feel like\\, it has the heart\\, the thrills\\, the music\\, the action\\, the visuals\\, the nostalgia and as always the high quality characters\/actors and soul-warming essense that made the saga unique. \\nIt may not be perfect as it has some cheesy moments and plot flaws like any (Star Wars) film\\, nevertheless i'm grateful for this episode\\, it is a very fine and exciting addition to the saga (probably already one of my favorites) and i certainly can say i'd definately much rather have this new Star Wars movies than not having Star Wars movies at all.\\nMy advice for everyone regardless of you being a fan or not would be to just have fun\\, enjoy the ride and let yourself inmerse into the movie and its story. \\nGreat work from director and franchise fan Rian Johnson\\, definately worth the wait and the time.","true":true}
