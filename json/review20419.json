Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I used to like this movie for approximately a year and a half....but after some deep soul searching\\, I must agree with the Star Wars fans who hated this sequel. The Last Jedi really is a franchise-killing movie. Rian Johnson ruined Luke Skywalker. He made him a cranky\\, old\\, hermit who drinks green milk from a cowlike creature on an island and hesitated to kill his own apprentice\/nephew in his sleep which caused him to overreact when he saw his uncle attempting to kill him and became Kylo Ren. So that makes Luke a lost cause. It was out of character. And there's so much more that's wrong with this film.","true":true}
