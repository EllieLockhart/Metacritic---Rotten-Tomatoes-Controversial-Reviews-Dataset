Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While initially exciting\\, after taking time to really think about the film. huge problems emerge. From the ridiculous \\\"sidequest\\\" to the poor choices in story progression and lack of backstory\\, The Last Jedi suffers from many poor choices. Beautiful to look at\\, genuinely funny moments\\, and several fantastic action scenes still make this a must-see film\\, but this is far from the best film in the Star Wars Universe.","true":true}
