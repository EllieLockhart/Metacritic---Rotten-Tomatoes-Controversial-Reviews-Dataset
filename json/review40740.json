Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may not be the worst SW movie ever made but it is the most un-SW SW movie ever made and is completely missing the SW magic. The way some character stories were handled was a huge slap in the face to fans. The core story could have been a plot point in Spaceballs. Someone\u2019s sense of humor sucks. I have been thru double-digit viewings of every SW movie\u2026Hope and Empire might be creeping towards 100 x I hated this movie and am heartbroken about it.","true":true}
