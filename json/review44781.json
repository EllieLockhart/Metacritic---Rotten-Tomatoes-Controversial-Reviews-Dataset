Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tried too hard for laughs.   If I wanted jokes\\, I'd watch Spaceballs. Killing Snoke with no explanation of who he is? Captain Phasma getting less screen time than Porgs? Rey and Kylo \\\"force skyping\\\" Rey's parents are \\\"nobodies\\\"\\, and Luke Skywalker giving up because  things got hard?     I am done with Star Wars.   Done.","true":true}
