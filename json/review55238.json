Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw it and there was a lot to digest\\, but overall a very solid Star Wars movie. I will be watching it again later this weekend for sure. I actually enjoyed the fact that the plot was pretty seamless and it most definitely was not recycled from any previous Star Wars movies of the past. The scenes where there was humor was timed perfectly and was not over-the-top\\, either. The various fight scenes in the movie were satisfying and some of the plot twists were pretty good\\, too. I absolutely recommend this movie! Pro Tip: Watch Episode 7 (The Force Awakens) the day\/night before seeing The Last Jedi for an even better movie experience.\\n\\nAnd remember: May the Force be with you\\, always.","true":true}
