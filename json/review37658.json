Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a lot to like for both longtime fans of the franchise\\, and newcomers. An exciting ride with plenty of tension and drama.\\n\\nIf you come to the movie with preconceived theories and notions of what will happen\\, you may leave disappointed or upset\\, but everything that plays out fits the concept of the Star Wars universe as it has been built.\\n\\nSome of the side stories are somewhat clumsily bolted on\\, but they serve their purpose and do not detract from the experience.","true":true}
