Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am ok with the plot although there are details that do not make sense. Daisy Ridley does another great job acting as Rey. Everyone else\\, just trying WAY too hard to the point that the acting is just bad. Leia's scene using the force was awful\\, too dramatic and not necessary. Some background stories not necessary as well for some characters. Just watching past Star Wars movies and then watching this one\\, this one just seems different and not in a good way. I like the training details for Rey but some actual training scenes with the force like what Luke went through with Yoda would have been a cool comparison. But instead attention was on her connection with Kylo (which was necessary but do a little of both...) Probably the worst of the movies unfortunately after I felt Rogue One was pretty good. Group I went to see it with had worse opinions for the movie than me...","true":true}
