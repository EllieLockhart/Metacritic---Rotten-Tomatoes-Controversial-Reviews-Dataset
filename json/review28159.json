Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor character development\\, Poor story line. even with the shocking twists. Lots of plot holes during the movie. \\nThe only Star Wars movie that has LOST the magic of what Star Wars should be. The movie has Amazing CGI\\, Beautifull music and scenes... But it is does not feel like a saga story in a star Wars universe...","true":true}
