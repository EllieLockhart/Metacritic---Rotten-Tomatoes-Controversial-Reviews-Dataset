Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what the hell Disney was thinking here. This is definitely not your typically star wars film and not for the right reasons. The story meanders for a loooong time and when it finally does get back on track it is just disappointing.","true":true}
