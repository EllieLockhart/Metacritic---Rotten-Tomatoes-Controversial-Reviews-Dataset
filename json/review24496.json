Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most fantastic Star Wars movie to date. The connection that all Force users have to the Force itself was beautifully illustrated\\, finally\\, and the relationship between Rey and Kylo was a wonderful iteration of two lonely people finding the Force within each other.\\n\\nI broke into sobs at Carrie Fisher's performance. Rest in peace\\, Princess. The Force is with you\\, always.","true":true}
