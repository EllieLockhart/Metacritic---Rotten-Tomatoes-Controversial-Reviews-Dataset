Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seeing Luke as a teacher\\, with what was revealed during the film\\, is a much better story than what a lesser screenwriter would have written. \\nIn fact\\, the whole movie was written for grown-ups to take their kids to. It had the jokes and explosions for the kids and it had themes that you need to think about.","true":true}
