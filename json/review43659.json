Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was quite the interesting Star Wars release. Either you are going to love it or you are going to hate it! They have a director who has never done a Star Wars movie before and he just shook things up tremendously. I have to admit that we Star Wars fans are definitely stuck in our ways and want things to be a certain way. But he swooped in and just showed us some stuff we have never seen before. I was mad after watching it the first time. But when I watched it the second time and started reading all the fan comments and checking out all the theories\\, I really grew to like this movie. The throne room fight scene was just breathtaking. I also enjoyed the final fight as well on the snow planet. There were some new Jedi tricks we have never seen before!","true":true}
