Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The Last Jedi was incredible.  It contained some of the most moving\\, powerful and flat-out fun scenes of any movie in the entire series.  I loved the story and how it advanced the characters\\, especially Rey\\, Kylo and Poe.  Mark Hammilll gives one of the best performances of the year in my opinion.\\n\\nI've read some of the negative reviews on here\\, and it sounds like they are coming from fans who had a set story in their heads\\, along with plenty of brilliant Snoke theories\\, and couldn't handle anything but their dream movie.  Sorry\\, but movies don't really work like that.  Writer\/director Rian Johnson actually made his movie and told his story.  The promotional materials had a bearded\\, weathered Luke in a self-appointed exile saying that the Jedi had to end and that this wasn't going to go the way you thought.  That was a message directed straight at fans that wanted nothing more than a nostalgia fest with a predictable plot.  A young do-gooder finds an old wizard and they go save the day!  That would have been a lot of fun but haven't we seen that movie?\\n\\nWith all great Star Wars movies there are also brilliant philosophy and messages interwoven into the plot.  Some of these themes may be hard to swallow from the \\\"you ruined my childhood\\\" crowd\\, but they landed for the rest of us.  Loved the movie and thank you\\, Rian Johnson for it!","true":true}
