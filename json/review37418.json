Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"there are a couple of cool moments in this movie\\, but extraordinarily incompetent and underdeveloped characters on both sides of the galactic struggle make it virtually unwatchable.  i'm not sure if it was the writing or the directing\\, but it did not seem to be an issue with acting--it actually looks like most of the people did the best they could with what they were given.  Unfortunately\\, there is just too much filler and not nearly enough substance.  what little substance there is seems to be at odds with what we have seen from the franchise in the past.  Save yourself the time and watch\/read a quick synopsis to catch up.","true":true}
