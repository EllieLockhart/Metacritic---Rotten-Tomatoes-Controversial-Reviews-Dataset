Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't believe how many moments in this installment that frustrated me.  Only the occasional decent fight scene kept me from walking out.  Hollywood seems unable to get even slightly close to what was delivered in the Empire Strikes Back.  Only when the franchise focused on the more adult themes of good versus evil did they get anywhere near delivering on the promise of this line of films.  Whenever they tried to tap into the childrens versions of this so they could cash in after the movie they ultimately fail.\\n\\nFFS they even had Yoda making light in this one....  and little furry creatures making a wookie question their lunch choices.....really.\\n\\nWhy do I keep the faith when it has so rarely been rewarded.  As I write this the audience vote is at 51%.  Someone must be using the force to keep it that high and the critics % is a joke.","true":true}
