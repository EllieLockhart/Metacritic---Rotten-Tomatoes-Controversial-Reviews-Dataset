Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like this movie is a massive missed opportunity. I can respect that the Director had a unique vision for his Star Wars movie thought I feel like he completely threw away all the story lines JJ Abrams had built up in The Force Awakens. I enjoyed Kylo Ren and Rey much more in this film though in the end the story left much to be desired and I feel like the director\\, Rian Johnson\\, has seen the films that this one is supposed to be based on since the recurring characters do not act like themselves.","true":true}
