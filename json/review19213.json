Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's literally unbelievable that Lucasfilm would release this.  It's as if a child wrote the screenplay. I find it extremely odd that the critics reviews of this film were positive.  It leads one to believe that Disney initiated \\\"Operation Damage Control\\\" prior to its release\\, and they've honestly been doing so ever since.  Sorry Mickey Mouse\\, but your attempts at the old Jedi mind trick to try to convince us that this movie is anything but utter shit is just not working and future of this franchise does not look good at all.  It truly saddens me to say that as a lifelong fan since seeing A New Hope at the drive in theater at 4 years old in 1977\\, I'm now completely indifferent as to where Star Wars is heading.  I simply don't care anymore after seeing The Last Jedi.","true":true}
