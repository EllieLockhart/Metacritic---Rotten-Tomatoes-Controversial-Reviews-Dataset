Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"purport to reflect all Star Wars fans' views here\\, only my own (even if I imply otherwise). TLDR: If you don't care about Star Wars\\, you probably won't be interested in reading further anyway.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor whatever reason\\, critics loved Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (TLJ).[1] It will most likely gross billions across the world; I would be surprised if it didn't nestle itself comfortably in the top ten all-time record for box office receipts. As Mark Hamill\\, the actor who plays Luke Skywalker in the franchise\\, tellingly shared in a recent interview about the film\\,\\n\\n \\n\\n\\\"Remember kids\\, it's not important if it's not high quality; only if it makes money. So\\, [just] because The Force Awakens made a lot of money [that doesn't mean] it was good.\\\"[2]\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the record\\, The Last Jedi was not good - but more on that later.  Hamill may have been talking about a different film\\, but his comments stand: Hollywood (and\\, in this instance\\, Disney) is in the business of making money\\, and will do whatever it can to generate revenue\\, regardless of the end product. With a series like Star Wars\\, that means making it marketable. Although I could quite happily launch into a tirade about the links between the new Star Wars films' creative bankruptcy and cynical studio decisions\\, that has already been done very well elsewhere (http:\/\/collider.com\/star-wars-the-last-jedi-problems-fandom-menace\/).\\n\\n \\n\\nInstead\\, I'd like to call out the film on two other\\, admittedly related\\, fronts\\, but not before providing some personal context.\\n\\n \\n\\nI must have been about six years old when I first watched Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. My parents had enjoyed the original trilogy when it came out in the '70s and '80s\\, and had bought them on VCD (yes\\, it was a long time ago) for us to watch. I can imagine my brother Sam (Joe was too young to watch it at the time) and I gathering around the TV and taking our seats on the sofa\\, unaware of what we were about to experience.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo say I enjoyed it would be an understatement. From the opening shot of the stars in a galaxy far\\, far away to the closing\\, triumphant end credits and John William's majestic score\\, I was hooked.  The rebellion had succeeded against all odds (\\\"Never tell me the odds!\\\")\\, the Empire had been dealt a decisive blow\\, and I had been won over. Star Wars was almost certainly the film that made me fall in love with all other films - the gateway to worlds I could immerse myself in\\, to places that expanded the realms of my imagination so far that even now I don't quite know how to express my gratitude to George Lucas for his creative influence on me.\\n\\n \\n\\nLucas showed the world what film could accomplish on a low budget\\, with unknown actors and a risky\\, inventive script. He succeeded in crafting a story so wonderful\\, a film so beautifully made\\, and so gosh-darned original (to my young mind\\, at least) that it could succeed in filling me with hope. Hope that evil could be defeated\\, that good would always win\\, and that the same could be true in my world\\, with or without the Force. It more than justified its title.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen I watched Star Wars\\, I felt. I experienced. I lived and breathed what was on screen.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs my brother and I raced our way through the rest of the saga (we were only temporarily stopped by the fact that Episode III: Revenge of the Sith had not yet come out) we took in as much as we possibly could. I must have played countless hours of Star Wars videogames and pored my way through over fifty Extended Universe novels\\, as well as watching and re-watching the films. I laughed as the characters laughed\\, sat in tension as they embarked on their latest crazy adventure\\, and mourned as familiar characters met their ends both onscreen and in the pages in front of me. The stories and the people in them were true to me\\, even if the galaxy they were set in didn't exist.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs boys grow up\\, they're taught not to cry. I distinctly remember the last time in a very long time that I sat down and had a proper cry: I don't quite recall why\\, but at some point in Year 6\\, at Bradbury School in Hong Kong\\, I found myself sitting under the stairwell\\, bawling my eyes out\\, for a good hour. Perhaps someone had said something hurtful; perhaps I had fallen over and hurt myself. I don't know. What I do know is that for about nine years after\\, I could not cry\\, except when I watched films.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn Christmas day\\, in 2012\\, I cried when Jean Valjean was shown mercy and grace in Les Miserables\\, and when he in turn showed grace to even his most persistent enemies. I cried when Michael Pena's character in End of Watch gave up his life to save his partner by lying on top of Jake Gyllenhall's bloodied\\, bullet-ridden body and giving him the chance to pretend he was dead\\, and to himself escape death\\, even as Pena bled out on top of him. I cried when Revenge of the Sith finally came out\\, and I saw Anakin murder younglings\\, burn down the Jedi Order I had grown to know and love\\, bring about Mace Windu's end and become Darth Vader.\\n\\n \\n\\nI cried when I saw his Master Obi-Wan's shattered\\, broken face as he lamented\\, \\\"You were the Chosen One! You were supposed to destroy the Sith\\, not join them. You were supposed to bring balance to the force\\, not leave it in darkness [...] You were my brother\\, Anakin! I loved you.\\\" I cried tears of pure\\, genuine grief both because I understood the gravity of what the man who was now Vader had done and what he would later do in The Return of the Jedi to redeem himself and save the galaxy - to show his son\\, Luke\\, that there was still good in him. Say what you will about the prequels\\, but they meant something to me. They were real.\\n\\n \\n\\nI have\\, of course\\, felt other emotions when watching the Star Wars saga (and a host of many other great films)\\, but I note my tears because the fact that I cried at all contrasted so much with the rest of my life - with my repressed\\, teenage angst - that to not mention them would be to miss out on a significant part of my lived experience\\, of the person I was\\, of my identity. Even when I couldn't express myself in the world in a healthy way\\, films offered me a chance to live vicariously: to experience and project my own life onto the stories I watched and read.\\n\\n \\n\\nFilms\\, then\\, and Star Wars in particular\\, have always had a special place in my heart. It is for that reason that I hated Episode VII: The Force Awakens. Far from bringing back memories of my childhood\\, it tarnished them by quite literally rehashing a story I had already seen before. J.J. Abrams was commanded by Disney executives to re-write A New Hope for a modern audience. Like any good errand boy\\, he delivered.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs a film\\, Awakens was\\, admittedly\\, decent. As a Star Wars movie\\, though\\, it was terrible - it took the originality of the original trilogy (and prequels)\\, and told me - and viewers everywhere - that we were too lazy and stupid to invest in something that was nearly forty years old (in 2015 - A New Hope came out in 1977) no matter how legendary that something might be. It said\\, in essence: what we have now isn't good enough\\, so let's remake it. Let's 'Hollywood' all over a dearly loved franchise. Let's remake one of the greatest films of all time - the film responsible for the creation of the term 'blockbuster' (people queued up\\, quite literally\\, for blocks outside the cinema to see the film).\\n\\n \\n\\nAt the time\\, people told me that I ought not to worry. As Awakens was\\, they said\\, good on its own merits\\, it bode well for future films in this new trilogy (and beyond). Sure\\, they said\\, they might have been 'inspired' by a few things from the previous films (\\\"It's another Death Star.\\\" \/ \\\"I wish that were the case\\, Major [...] \/ it's bigger\\\")\\, and sure\\, they might have sacrificed the entire extended canon (novels\\, videogames\\, my childhood - that which I held dear)\\, but it would be worth it\\, they said. They would use this as a launching pad to create something genuinely new\\, genuinely creative - the Star Wars I knew and loved. I had enjoyed the first third of the film (on Jakku\\, where we introduced to Finn and Rey): it\\, at the very least\\, was exciting and fresh in a way the rest of the film was not. Therein lay a sliver\\, a glimmer of hope - hope that Star Wars could be what it was meant to be once again.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Last Jedi proved this hope to be woefully misplaced.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhatever tatters Awakens left me with were utterly destroyed in Episode VIII. Practically every bit of tradition\\, history and that which was worth cherishing from the previous films (including\\, somehow\\, The Force Awakens) was burnt up in a flaming dung-heap of a film.\\n\\n \\n\\nTLJ was\\, in a word\\, mediocre\\, and all the more disappointing for it. Almost every 'safe' plot decision that could be made was made. They decided not to kill Leia or a litany of other characters (Finn in particular was 'saved'\\, ex machina\\, from what would have been a heroic\\, self-sacrificial death towards the end of the film - presumably to sell more toys).\\n\\n \\n\\nThey raised a series of fairly major plot questions and hoped that we wouldn't notice when they were left entirely unanswered (What were the three lessons Luke was meant to teach Rey? Why should the Jedi end? What was the basis for the new 'force powers' we were shown? When and how did Leia suddenly 'get' force powers? Why does she only use them once\\, when the plot seems to require her to?).\\n\\n \\n\\nThey mismanaged almost all of the film's major characters (except perhaps Luke\\, who was given an excellent send-off by Mark Hamill\\, despite his strange dialogue and characterisation\\, and Kylo Ren\\, who thankfully moved on from the whinier\\, Vader-obsessed version of himself in the previous film). Supreme Leader Snoke\\, for example\\, who was so menacingly set up in the previous film\\, turned out to be a non-threatening damp squib of a character whose death was neither surprising nor particularly well done (How could someone that powerful and force-aware not see Kylo's very predictable betrayal coming?).\\n\\n \\n\\nThat is still to say nothing about Snoke's ineffective guards or the less-than-unnecessary side plot to the casino planet which added to an already considerable run time (TLJ is the longest Star Wars film to date) and in fact directly resulted in the deaths of countless Resistance fighters.\\n\\n \\n\\nI could go on (and believe me I am tempted to\\, and have done at length with those willing to listen) but that would be to distract from the film's main crime: its utter disregard for its predecessors and the fans who so dearly loved them. It refused to take itself seriously at any point\\, even while simultaneously portraying situations of the utmost importance to billions of people in the galaxy (and millions here on earth).[3]\\n\\n \\n\\nThis had two effects:\\n\\n \\n\\nThe safety and survival of the major characters was never in doubt (except perhaps Captain Phasma\\, who had already been shown to be a joke in the previous film) which\\, in turn\\, meant that any tension the film tried to create fell flat. In short\\, I didn't buy into the believability of the story. It lost me very\\, very early on. That anyone should be able say this about a space opera should be a contradiction in terms\\, but as I've noted TLJ doesn't really care about laws - either of the film kind or otherwise (How could you drop bombs in space - a zero gravity environment?).\\n \\n\\nFans of the previous films had their precious memories deconstructed in front of them\\, bit by torturous bit. From Luke throwing away the lightsaber that beloved characters had quite literally died to protect\\, to Rian Johnson's baffling decision to have Luke call said lightsaber a 'laser sword' and the Jedi Order a 'religion' (which Vader seemed quite clearly to disagree with in A New Hope\\, when he force choked one of his admirals to death) to Luke's completely contradictory explanation to Rey that Force-sensitivity was in 'everyone' (midichlorian counts would beg to differ) and that bloodlines were therefore no longer important (giving me even less reason to believe Rey's inexplicable powers and abilities in this film and the last)\\, this film gave a massive 'up yours' to any and all previous mythology.\\n \\n\\nThe latter of these two points is my first main problem with The Last Jedi as a Star Wars film; that is\\, its disrespect for the elderly (or at least those fans older than 18 who grew up with either the original or prequel trilogy) and for history. I've said this several times throughout this blog post already\\, but not because I like hearing the sound of my own (writing) voice. I've repeated myself both to emphasise the point and to help you\\, the reader\\, understand what I'm trying to say\\, as clearly as possible. This is the value of repetition\\, of learning from the past: eventually\\, the message gets through and we stop repeating old mistakes. This in turn allows us to come up with something new and beautiful\\, as we build on a firm foundation.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen we fail to respect and learn from the past - especially where it contains valuable insights\\, stories and wisdom - terrible things happen. Nazism happens (if only The Treaty of Versailles had been kinder to the Germans). Genocide happens\\, generation after generation (if only one massacre were enough to show that religious and ethnic segregation and labelling are almost always terrible ideas). Racism happens (if only Martin Luther King's dream would bear fruit in America today).\\n\\n \\n\\nI am by no means equating The Last Jedi with Nazism\\,[4] genocide or structural racism. Nor am I using them as buzzwords to beat the film over the head with. What I am trying to say is that there is value in being aware of the failures of the past\\, just as there is in paying homage to its successes. Wilberforce\\, having failed to abolish slavery in the UK\\, came up with a new plan: to lobby to abolish the slave trade - in this he was successful. NASA and their Russian counterparts tried countless times to get mankind onto the moon before JFK's dream was fulfilled in 1969\\, nearly a decade after his original announcement. Only after I realised that I could not control my addiction to pornography did I turn to God\\, who had provided healing and deliverance countless times before in other ways and areas.[5]\\n\\n \\n\\nTLJ's dismantling of its predecessors unsurprisingly 'succeeds' in alienating millions of older fans\\, many of whom have vowed to boycott the next film as a result. It 'succeeds' precisely because it fails to pay its respects to the past (where Awakens merely ripped it off\\, The Last Jedi spat on George Lucas' legacy). It 'succeeds' in catering to a younger generation of Disney fans as it almost deliberately fails to repay the faith of those who have always loved the franchise - as it fails to understand that there is value in maintaining old relationships even as there is value in building new ones. It trades a fifty-year-old legacy for temporary 'relevance' in a fickle world. What Anakin was to the Jedi Order\\, The Last Jedi is to loyal fans everywhere: a painful betrayal.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis brings me to my next point. The film's script unashamedly\\, if subtly\\, reflects one of the most depressing aspects of Western culture today: it celebrates the selfish individualism (\\\"I am the centre of my own universe and can do whatever I want.\\\") that fuels the consumerism and materialism that drive our societies today. The very forces that have progressively fractured families\\, encouraged people to retreat further and further into their smartphone or some other new-fangled gadget\\, and which have left people desperately in search of genuine meaning when they realise that living a life turned in on itself is lonely and pointless\\, were on display in this film if you cared to look hard enough.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat on earth\\, you ask\\, is the basis for my claim? Well\\, I answer: all the stuff I've just been talking about. When you tear down tradition to make money off a new generation of children (or\\, more accurately\\, their parents)\\, all in the name of 'moving the franchise forwards'\\,[6] you make the clear statement that you know what is best for the (Star Wars) world and it doesn't matter how many people (reasonably) disagree with you - you're your own boss so others' reservations are irrelevant.[7]\\n\\n \\n\\nIt's not so much the actual content of TLJ that promotes this empty philosophy; it is the assumption that it's 'my way or the highway' when in fact there is a very clear route already mapped out (that of the structure\\, narrative and\\, yes\\, rules of the first six films). That is not to say that TLJ had to be creatively shackled; it is instead to assert that where something good already exists\\, it should have worked with it. It should have built on its foundation\\, learning from both its strengths and weaknesses\\, to make something new and beautiful.\\n\\n \\n\\nDoing this does\\, of course\\, require hard work\\, but I would argue that this work is more than worth it if you manage to keep onside those people who have always supported and loved that which you are creating - people who will take their children to see the new films\\, and indeed their children's children\\, nephews\\, nieces\\, first cousins twice removed and so on\\, and so on\\, and so on.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo not do so is to be monumentally selfish. To do so is to put your own interests (here: Disney's financial motivations) above those of others (the loyal fanbase). It's all very well to say that you had to create a film for a 'new generation of fans' but this only holds water when there are no viable alternatives. The success (financially\\, critically\\, and otherwise) of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - which did exactly what I have been suggesting The Last Jedi should have - should be ample proof that you can please both old fans and new. While the two films are different\\, the principle stands.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat makes the situation even more tragic is that The Last Jedi could have been better than Rogue One\\, as it had even more creative space within which to operate (while remaining within the guidelines set out by the previous films). The latter film was explicitly concerned with solving a minor plot hole from A New Hope\\, and yet it still succeeded in maintaining artistic integrity: It had the courage to kill off all of its major protagonists (in heroic\\, cathartic deaths)\\, it included a convincing\\, racially diverse cast (something which critics who liked The Last Jedi seem to be obsessing about\\, notwithstanding the fact that Rogue's actors from minority ethnic backgrounds were at least key contributors to the plot\\, which can hardly be said for TLJ)\\, and it showed that you didn't need to have the Force to be a hero.\\n\\n \\n\\nAll that mattered in Rogue was that you were willing to fight and die for a cause bigger than yourself - that you had hope and spirit. By contrast\\, The Last Jedi's 'solution' the problem of overpowered force users is very different: \\\"Let's just say anyone can have force powers! Let's let everyone be the centre of their own galaxy\\, with their own special powers!\\\" I know which approach I find more narratively satisfying.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt best\\, TLJ was a misguided attempt to target a new audience (Frozen-fed Disney tweens\\, toddlers\\, and everything in between) in the hope that everyone else would get on board without reservation. At worst\\, it was the pinnacle of self-indulgent\\, lazy scriptwriting. At worst\\, it was a film that was destined to offend the original fandom precisely because that was its intention. At worst\\, it was Disney's very own Star (Wars) Destroyer: a film that has forever ruined the legacy of its progenitors.\\n\\n \\n\\nEpilogue:\\n\\n \\n\\nThankfully\\, The Last Jedi is neither the Star Wars franchise's \\\"only hope\\\" nor my own. There will be other films with other writers\\, each of whom will have their own chance to recapture the cinematic magic of the previous films. Even if Luke's lightsaber (the inheritance passed on by Episodes I to VI) is never picked up by future filmmakers under Disney's repressive thumb\\, we\\, the fans\\, will always be able to cling on to that which was beautiful\\, that which was original\\, that which inspired millions.\\n\\n \\n\\nMore than that\\, those of us who hope to write stories of our own can respectfully borrow what has shaped us from those films\\, and show our love for Lucas and indeed good storytelling in what we create. We can remember and learn from the past. We can say to Disney: you can keep your capitalist agenda but you can't have our souls\\, our passions\\, our hope. You can feed others what you think they want to see\\, hear and feel\\, but you can't fool us. You can rebrand Star Wars but you can't steal our childhoods - our conception of what it should be.\\n\\n \\n\\nYou\\, Disney\\, cannot win.\\n\\n \\nLong live the Rebellion.","true":true}
