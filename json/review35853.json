Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is something truelly unique and fantastic. The development it accomplishes in a single movie is unrivaled by any other in the franchise. While stunning action sequences continue to be a hallmark of the all Star Wars films\\, the Last Jedi utilizes character in amanner that hasn't been seen since the original trilogy.","true":true}
