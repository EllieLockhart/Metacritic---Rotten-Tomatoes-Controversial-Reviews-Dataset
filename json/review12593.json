Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't give any work of art five stars\\, because nothing is perfect.  However\\, this is a great movie and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe.  It moved quickly\\, developed characters well\\, had great action sequences\\, and subverted expectations.  This movie changed the way I saw some of my favorite heroes\\, but that isn't a bad thing.  People grow and change and\\, yes\\, make mistakes.  They also fail\\, sometimes.  The thing I loved about this movie is that the heroes keep getting kicked in the teeth\\, but they keep getting back up and fighting for what they believe in.  I've seen it twice and I might go see it again in the theater.","true":true}
