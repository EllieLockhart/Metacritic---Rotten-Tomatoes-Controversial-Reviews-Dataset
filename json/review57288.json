{"101487":184372,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mixed bag for me. It\u2019s a enjoyable movie\\, with a unique story in the SW universe and some good character arcs and moments\\, but sometimes had problems with the pacing. It doesn\u2019t really move much forward from where it started to where it ended and it\u2019s definitely Not as good as Empire Strikes Back like a lot of people are saying. The message of failure overall was good\\, the settings and shots were beautiful. My biggest problem with it was Luke\u2019s characterization\\, even though this is Mark Hamill\u2019s best performance as him. Right form the moment when he picked Anakin\u2019s lightsaber and then threw it away I knew\\, without a doubt\\, that this was not going to go the way I thought (but hey we were warned by Luke right in the trailers). Also\\, the Finn and Rose story arc\\, I didn\u2019t hate it but I feel like John Boyega\u2019s potencial was so wasted in this movie. What was the point of having Phasma so you could kill her right away? It was as bad as Boba Fett\u2019s death. Some of the humor was not bad\\, unexpected in a Star Wars movie\\, but didn\u2019t bother me that much. It seemed like everything JJ Abrams built to in TFA was thrown away so that Rian Johnson could put his own vision. It\u2019s not a bad movie but the some of the choices the characters make\\, specially Luke\\, just seem out of place. Snoke\u2019s death would\u2019ve been so much better if instead of showing us what Kylo was really planning to do\\, keep Snoke saying what Kylo was thinking but don\u2019t show him moving the lightsaber. The movie still has some good moments like the Throne Room fight scene\\, when Luke is teaching Rey about the force\\, Yoda\u2019s appearance\\, Luke and Leia together\\, when R2 shows Luke Leia\u2019s message from the OT. Luke\u2019s last scene where it mirrored the twin suns in Tattoine from Ep IV was my favorite. The best thing was that Poe got more screen time which is always a good thing. I admire Rian Johnson for trying to go in a different and fresh direction but sometimes the movie doesn\u2019t feel like a Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
