Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore all these reviews from people scared of change. This movie tries new things and mainly does an incredible job of it. Yes there are one or two missteps. But it's an exhilarating ride from beginning to end that surprises you and makes you care about the characters. Change is good.","true":true}
