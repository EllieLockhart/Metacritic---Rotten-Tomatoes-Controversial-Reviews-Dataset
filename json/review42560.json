Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a slap in the face to fans of the original trilogy\\, as well as fans of The Force Awakens. With a few rare exceptions\\, this movie seemed to purposefully desecrate what fans have loved about these movies for the sake of being \\\"innovative.\\\" I didn't love The Force Awakens\\, but I walked out of that movie excited about the possibilities for the rest of the trilogy. After the last Jedi\\, I walked out of the  theatre with no burning questions\\, no anticipation for the next installment\\, and sad to know that my love for the franchise has been tainted by the travesty that this movie is.","true":true}
