Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They killed luke off too quickly and without any scenes of him kicking ass. That's what we all came to see. Such a waste. They should have uphled the integrity of his character and waited until the last film to give him an honorable send off\\, if that's how it had to go. So disappointed. Wasted opportunity and a comlplete fumble of the star wars saga. Fumbled right into a shitty toilet.","true":true}
