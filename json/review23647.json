Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love the plot twists and strong female leads. While there could have been different ways to address questions from The Force Awakens\\, I respect the producers and director's vision. Looking forward to Star Wars IX.","true":true}
