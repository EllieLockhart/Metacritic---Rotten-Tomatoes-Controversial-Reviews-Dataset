Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"garbage movie. This is not star wars. I don't know what this is\\, but i know what it is not. Plot holes galore\\, character assassinations of beloved characters\\, boring new characters and mary sue's. heavy fisted moral posturing at the expense of plot.","true":true}
