Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I held out hope until they Peter-Panned Leia\\, and then it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming\\, \\\"Damn you\\, Disney!\\\" Everything that made the franchise so endearing was gone. You'll find no Campbellesque heroes or mythology here. The actors struggled to find character development which didn't involve inanimate objects. The \\\"humor\\\" (if you could call it that) as on par with what you'd overhear at a grade school playground. Our beloved Luke's character arc was about as exciting as an AARP commercial. Was Benicia Del Torro in it? I was nodding off at that point\\, but I'll bet The Collector was stoked to find the blue-milk walrus\\, and hopefully offered her a fair price. Chewbacca ate a  Dancing Hamster\\, which somehow endeared him to the surviving space rodents. The editors inexplicably spliced in a scene from  Casino Royale when it got REALLY slow. Kylo's shirtless bathroom   Skype was pretty hot\\, but his OKCupid profile is probably disturbing. Other boring things happened to characters I didn't care about\\, and in the end\\, everyone got on their spacephones to protest the appeal of net neutrality. \\n\\nOn the upside - I can die peacefully now\\, knowing that I will never look forward to a Star Wars movie release again. Thanks\\, Disney.","true":true}
