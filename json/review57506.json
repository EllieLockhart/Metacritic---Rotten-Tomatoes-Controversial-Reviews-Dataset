Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a brilliant film\\, exploring themes ranging from dealing with failure and old age to completely throwing away the idea that to save the galaxy you need to have essentially royal lineage and that anyone can step up and save the galaxy with the right attitude and guidance. Seriously this it the thinking mans star wars and it's amazing that there's such negative reaction because people didn't get their perfect Luke Skywalker fight scene they have been imagining since Return of the Jedi. I find it hilariously ironic that I am defending this movie in the same way BvS fans defend that film\\, because I think that film is garbage\\, but they claim that it is only for smart DC fans.... which is ridiculous. This on the other had explores themes that delve into a deeper more thought provoking meaning than just Jedi vs Sith. Cannot say enough about this film.","true":true}
