Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an abomination to the art of film. Characters ran in circles\\, scenes drug viewers along to reveal nothing\\, the writers don't understand what it means to overcome struggle\\, preconceived intensions for the movie blind sighted writers and producers from knowing what a story needs to connect to an audience and have meaning\\, dialogue was cyclical\\, scenes did not meld together to a great climax but were random and poorly thought through...and the criticism can dive deeper and deeper.","true":true}
