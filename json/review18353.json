Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a wonderful follow up to TFA. It was interesting\\, fun and a hell of an adventure. Plus now we have the best dual lightsaber fight I've ever seen. Don't let the bots get you down. See this movie!!","true":true}
