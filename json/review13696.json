Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally got to see this movie and I'm absolutely shocked at how disappointed I was. Totally misunderstood and misused Luke completely disrespecting the character and crapped all over what a heroes journey is supposed to be\\, hamfisted nonsensical romance between people with no chemistry or who's pairing is unnecessary. I was so excited too. They basically Game of throned this. What a slap in the face.  It took the Force Awakens and said naw\\, scratch that. Listen.. subverting expectations is one thing\\, totally crapping on a legacy and wiping your butt with it is quite another. Sure\\, visuals are awesome but it just felt empty.","true":true}
