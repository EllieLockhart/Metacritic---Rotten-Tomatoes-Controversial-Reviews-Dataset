Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" I immediately re-watched all 7 other episodes. Since that\\, I went back to the cinema and watched The Last Jedi again. \\nAfter all this\\, I decided this one was my second favourite in the Saga. First being \\\"The Return Of the Jedi\\\".\\nThis movie is fresh\\, cinematically brilliant\\, and overall an entertaining and informal movie about the Force and its abilities.","true":true}
