Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a lot I liked about the movie but a few things I cannot let go. First it was not Luke's time to perish. 2nd when Luke first held his lightsaber again\\, it should have brought back some epic memories in some sort of flashback scene. Luke would have always understood what turns a jedi to the dark side. He would never just give up on the jedi like he was portrayed. When yoda showed up\\, Luke should have showed more humility and reverence for his former master. It was almost like oh hey yoda... I also think the seriousness of the situation Anakin and Obi one should have been there with Yoda mentoring Luke. The movie was good\\, but not good enough for a true star wars fan.","true":true}
