Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst Star Wars movie EVER made (if you dare call this Star Wars)... Absolute SJW\\, sexist\\, anti-male Bullshit that ruins the entire (movie).. Cannot believe how they RUINED Luke Skywalker\\, how they made an interesting character (Snoke) into a useless filler character with no background and with no importance whatsoever ! HUGE plot holes and Terrible writing makes this (movie..) a huge pile of rubbish. Keep your filthy political agendas and sexist hate out of movies please\\, if you cannot do that\\, don't make any movies at all ! This (movie..) is a total insult to any (real) Star Wars fans\\, except the ones who know nothing about Star Wars and grew to like Jar Jar...  ONE star for me\\, and it's forced because apparently half star ratings do not count so...  This (movie..) does offer good music and CGI effects\\, the only redeemable quality !","true":true}
