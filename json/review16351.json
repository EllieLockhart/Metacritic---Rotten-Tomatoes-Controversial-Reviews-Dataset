Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm only a casual Star Wars fan so I usually chuckle at people who say things like a particular character\\, story line\\, or film 'ruined Star Wars for me'.\\n\\nWell\\, this film ruined Star Wars for me.\\n\\nMan\\, what a fiasco. There were a lot of cringe-worthy scenes. The whole Casino planet\/code breaker story line? WTF was that!? Luke is a bitter prick? The ladies who command the rebels wear evening gowns? I could go on forever about how insanely ridiculous and flawed this movie is.\\n\\nBottom line is this. I don't know how many times I've seen the first trilogy\\, and I've even re-watched the prequels a couple times. I will NEVER watch TLJ ever again. Not out of protest or because I feel betrayed by Disney. It was just a bad movie.","true":true}
