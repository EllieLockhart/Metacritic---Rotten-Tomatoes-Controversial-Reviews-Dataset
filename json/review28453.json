Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty disappointed after TFA was so good and set this up to have such awesome potential... Kinda bummed actually. No idea why they didn\u2019t have JJ Abrams direct all 3 but this new director and writer was terrible! They ruin every attempt at making a dramatic scenes with awful attempts to be funny. But they just come off as extremely cheezy and go against what you think the character is and\/or would say. ","true":true}
