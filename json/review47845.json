Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"where to even start with this?\\nthe last jedi is an utter abomination of flimflamming that makes the prequels look on par with the original trilogy.\\nfrom start to finish this movie is ether nonsensical (eg the tumblr hair general refusing to let anyone\\, including other senior officers like poe\\, know that she actually has a plan witch ends up causing the death of at minimum 75% of the ships crew.)\\, pointless (the entire sub-plot with finn and that Asian chick nobody cares about)\\, or actively slapping its audience in the face (giveing zero information about snoke\\, rey's parents being nobody's\\, emasculating then killing off luke for no reason). \\nthis movie completely killed off any hope i had of the franchise ever improving\\, and even worse totally ruined the end of Return of the Jedi because know we know luke dies not just total failure but even worse\\, a quitter.","true":true}
