Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's very confusing in tone\\, so much is left unexplained that it's not clear how  to believably follow the characters. Little to no explanation on how the First Order took over the galaxy in which the Resistance is muddled with. Snoke\\, who started the First order\\, Seduced Kylo away from the Jedi and who triggered the events of Ep.7 and this trilogy\\, he's a nobody. Plot device to move plot along. This was not just the end for me and Star wars but maybe the end for me and new Cinema for 10 years time.","true":true}
