Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an excellent film. The cinematography\\, plot and acting were excellent\\, and it even had some thrown in comedy and incredible plot twists. The only problem is the length\\, as this film is over 2 hours long\\, and I saw it during a late night screening\\, meaning that it ended after midnight.\\nThe point is\\, it's a phenomenal film\\, but it is very long\\, and there were many points in it where I thought it was the end\\, but it kept going.","true":true}
