Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS: The Last Jedi was a change from the typical STAR WARS formula. We don't get the tried and true story structure of previous films\\, a deliberate decision by director Rian Johnson. Instead\\, we get an incoherent mess of a plotline that drags for 2.5 hours and ends on a strangely happy note\\, despite almost the entire Resistance force being eradicated. The comedy was forced\\, the characters were underdeveloped\\, and the conflicting severity and hilarity of the scenes lead to a misguided film that defies all convention in the STAR WARS franchise\\, despite the success of said conventions.","true":true}
