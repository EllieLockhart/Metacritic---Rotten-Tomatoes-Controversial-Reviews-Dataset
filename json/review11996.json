Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. I am a huge Star Wars fan and am so happy with where Rian has taken this story. He is moving beyond just the Skywalker story and making it feel so much bigger.","true":true}
