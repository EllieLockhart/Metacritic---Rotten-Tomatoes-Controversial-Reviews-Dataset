Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ completely feels like a movie that takes place in space but nothing related to the SW franchise. The movie has amazing CGI\\, its a truly beautiful movie.....BUT.....thats about it. Everything else sucks from beginning to end. Luke was supposed to be the strongest Jedi in existence\\, and yet all we get is a bitter old man that is afraid of himself. Finn is useless in this movie\\, no purpose whatsoever. Rey and her high school crush with Kylo (put a shirt on) made me want to pull my eyes out. Rename the movie to something other than Star Wars\\, because it had nothing to do with the franchise.","true":true}
