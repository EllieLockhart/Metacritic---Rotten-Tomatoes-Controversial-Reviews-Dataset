Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really wanted to love this movie. I have been waiting to see Luke Skywalker again since I was a kid. But after seeing it\\, and the more I think about it\\, I just can't get past alot of the decisions that have been made in TLJ.\\n\\nI thought TFA did open up alot of possibilities\\, and did like that movie. However\\, invalidating everything the rebellion did in order to set up the new trilogy as scrappy rebels vs the Empire all over again is repetitive and does not move the story forward. But I can get past that if the story is good. JJ Abrams love of introducing mysteries\\, without having the answer already determined\\, creates both an open book for the series to move forward however the next directory sees fit\\, but also shows a lack of overall story that this trilogy is trying to tell. Each chapter so far is just made up as we go along.\\n\\nSPOILERS will be below here\\, so if you don't want to be spoiled\\, please stop reading.\\n\\nMy largest problem with this movie is that it feels cobbled together. Ryan Johnson seems to have had his own ideas of a Star Wars movie\\, and just threw out some of the set up from the previous\\, without any fanfare or reasoning. Snoke\\, killed quickly just to set up Kylo as the ultimate bad guy\\, when Kylo really hasn't deserved it yet. Rey's parents being nobodies I can get behind\\, but in TFA when Kylo hears about a \\\"girl on Jakku\\\" helping in the escape\\, you can see his interest is immediately on that tidbit of news. As if he was aware of something regarding a \\\"girl\\\". As well as the discussion between Han and Maz about now who is this girl. There was set  up for there to be a more interesting backstory\\, that was just thrown out (she did not have to be a Skywalker\\, Solo\\, or Kenobi for something more interesting to come from why she was on Jakku).\\n\\nAnd the movie itself was one slow moving chase through empty space. Then you need something for Finn to do\\, so they leave the \\\"chase\\\" to go get \\\"important side character #17\\\" for some contrived plan to sneak onto the First Order ship\\, bring him back\\, then sneak onto the ship to disable the tracking system. Of course it was all for nothing and just a side plot for Finn character to have something to do\\, and a way to inform Hux about the real plan.\\n\\nSpeaking of the real plan\\, there was absolutely no reason for Holdo to not at least give a clue to other officers regarding her plan. She knew Poe was hot headed\\, and probably would go off on his own. Giving him some kind of heads up would have been a great way to avoid that.\\n\\nAnd now Holdo...totally unnecessary. Why create a new character we have no connection to that we would be expected to both believe\\, and feel for when they made the ultimate sacrifice. Ackbar was killed off unceremoniously early in the film. Having him argue with Poe\\, and pull off the maneuver would have had so much more weight to it.\\n\\nFinally Luke. I don't agree or personally like where they put the character\\, but I could live with it if there was a solid backstory for it. The one they decided on does not fit that criteria. Luke\\, the one person who still saw good in Vader and would not kill him\\, and would rather die than destroy his father\\, would have never even thought about killing Kylo. He has actually turned someone from the dark to the light. If anything they should have made it about his hubris about being able to keep Kylo from the dark\\, since he turned Vader\\, into the reason for his self-banishment. It was his father\/son relationship with Vader that saved Vader\\, and Han and Leia sending Kylo away would have been one of the reasons he is on his path. Luke believing he could keep him in the light\\, but not realizing the supreme importance of the personal connection of Han and Leia with Ben\\, and that they would be instrumental in keeping him in the light\\, would have led to the downfall of the temple. Luke realizing that he failed\\, not because he tried to kill him\\, but because of his overconfidence in his own abilities\\, drove him to exile himself. That would have made a ton more sense\\, and left him in the same spot we see in in TLJ.\\n\\nI am unsure where this series goes forward\\, and hope that somehow Episode IX can make some of this more appealing to me\\, but as of right now\\, I am doubting the future of the main Star Wars series. It has survived worse\\, but it can't survive forever like this.","true":true}
