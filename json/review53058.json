Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As long as you have Kathleen Kennedy involved in the Star Wars project at Disney\\, this will continue to be a disaster for the franchise. These Star Wars have less to do with Star Wars. For three movies now\\, following The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, these characters feel like children dropped into a Disney Star Wars theme park. (Gee\\, why might that be?) Every two minutes they stop to remind each other they're in Star Wars. \\nWhen they're not reminding each other of things that happened in previous movies or even previous scenes in the same movie\\, they're talking at great length about what they're going to do in the next scene - usually with tears in their eyes\\, inspirational music and the word HOPE mentioned at least twice.\\nThere are so many things wrong with Rian Johnson's abomination it's honestly hard to know where to begin - the criminal waste of Luke's final film appearance\\, the nonsensical plot (since when has space fuel been an issue in these movies?)\\, completely pointless casino mission\\, flying space Leia\\, Rose's entire character\\, the Phantom Menace-level awful \\\"Resistance Kids\\\".","true":true}
