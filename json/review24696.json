Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was long and has the same story from start to end. They run into a problem they make a plan\\, it goes wrong but they are saved in the end in one or other way.\\n\\nSome scenes are really good but some are like even if you remove them nobody will notice them.","true":true}
