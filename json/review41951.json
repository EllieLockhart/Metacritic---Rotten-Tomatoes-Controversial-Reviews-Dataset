Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed me to se it in theaters back December. I am now writing it to take a stand on how crappy Disney has just done to this beloved franchise. I liked The Force Awakens. But I will not accept this as part of Star Wars cannon. Ok only giving it 1.5 stars for the visual effects. Storyline was horrible with plot holes. Disney only made minor off this because of the name and JJ doing a decent revival of this franchise. Will not ever see a Rian Johnson movie again. Sorry but you may have fooled me once but not again. It ills me to rate a Star Wars movie so low. ","true":true}
