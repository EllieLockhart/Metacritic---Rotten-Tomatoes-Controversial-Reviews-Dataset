Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Character development\\, poor plot. The vast majority of the movie is about a band of Rebel Starships being chased by a First Order fleet of ships at sub-light speed. The First Order could have simply hyperspace other ships into the Rebels path -end of story. Leftist agenda pushed into a sub plot that added nothing to the film. When Rey meets emasculated Luke\\, its a major let down. Worst film of the whole franchise. Left the theater very disappointed!","true":true}
