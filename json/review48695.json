Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie ever made. Plot made no sense. Longest Star Wars movie ever made that could have been literally broken down to play out in a 30 minute movie. No good characters or character development. Useless dialogue. Ruins childhood. Do not watch. ","true":true}
