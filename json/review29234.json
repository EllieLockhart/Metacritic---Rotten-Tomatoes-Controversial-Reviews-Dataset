Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rest in peace Star Wars.\\nThe Force Awakens was really bad and although it had a few funny moments\\, characters\\, especially the villains (First Order?!) and the entirely copied plot of A New Hope\\, were just awkwardly comical.\\nBut yesterday night I saw the sequel to this already an absolute shit show.\\nLadies and gentlemen\\, I would like to personally ask the creators one simple question.\\nAre you fucking kidding me?\\n1 hour and a half of no progress in the story line whatsoever. At approximately 1:45 there was a sole moment I thought was pretty cool\\, only to be completely ruined about 5 minutes later.\\nAll and all this film is a terrible joke\\, piece of garbage and an abomination.\\nUnbelievable!","true":true}
