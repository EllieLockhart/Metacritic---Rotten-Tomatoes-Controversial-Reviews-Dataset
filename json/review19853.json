Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was awful\\, felt longer then Blade Runner 2049\\, and outside of the throne room scene and some of the last battle\\, devoid of thrills or excitement.   Of the three main plots\\, 1 is awful\\, one is meh\\, and one is okay.   If you cut out all but two of the jokes you would have the same amount of actual humor value.   This comes from someone who loved Rogue One and thought TFA was a okay.","true":true}
