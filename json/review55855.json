Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: The CGI was great. Visually the movie was stunning to look at. A few good action set pieces. The acting from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver was top notch. Cons: Everything from the story to plot to character motivations and everything in between. Aside from the many many plot holes and inconsistencies within the story\\, this movie really damaged the character of Luke Skywalker. In an attempt to add depth to his arc\\, the film replaces the heroism that made fans love his character in the original trilogy into this depressing nihilistic cowardice. I left the theater very disappointed. The last time I felt this disappointed after watching a Star Wars movie was Attack of the Clones. It's safe to say my interest for the sequels moving forward has diminished. What excited me about Disney taking over the Star Wars franchise was that they wouldn't repeat the mistakes George Lucas made with the prequels and they haven't... instead they've managed to make all new mistakes. 2\/5","true":true}
