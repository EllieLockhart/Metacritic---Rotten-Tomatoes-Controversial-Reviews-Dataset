Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would ever find myself here. Star Wars has been there for when I had a bad day\\, had a huge test\\, been down\\, etc. The Ladt Jedi tried to be successful in changing Star Wars; however\\, it abstracted the franchise so far it was unrecognizable. The story did not flow and had obvious points in it that did not make sense. In a world so stricken with being politically correct\\, we turn to entertainment to escape politics. I rather enjoy explosions\\, pew pews\\, and daring chances than being told that is rash\\, stupid\\, and a male ego problem. For a movie and new franchise so set on killing the past\\, the ending results with everything going back to being the same\\, which begs the question why the story was portrayed in that fashion\\, and prequels being created about past characters that we did not ask.","true":true}
