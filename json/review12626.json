Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't understand how this movie got so many high ratings among critics when this movie basically doesn't care about every single thing you expected to know after you watch the previous episode. And even if you forget that and ignore what a fan would like to see\\, the plot itself have some convenient points without sense that me question how much thought was put into it and why is so long.","true":true}
