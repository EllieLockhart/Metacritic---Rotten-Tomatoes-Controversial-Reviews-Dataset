Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan.  But not this one. Too long\\, no charm\\, poor plot lines\\, director Rain ruined what Force Awakens created.  Rogue One as a stand alone was MUCH better than this.  Reminded me more of episodes 1-3.... not excited to see final episode when it comes out...","true":true}
