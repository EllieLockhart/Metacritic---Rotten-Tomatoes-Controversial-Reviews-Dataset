Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not even going to describe the idiotic story and massively gaping plot holes. My main problem is this: why did Disney have to turn Star Wars into a hyper-liberal political statement? I'm a diehard Star Wars fan. I played the video games and read tons of Star Wars extended universe books growing up. None of these stories were excessively political. They told the story of men\\, women\\, aliens and robots without worrying that Twi'Lek females were underrepresented\\, for example. The Last Jedi\\, though\\, basically says\\, \\\"Screw you Star wars fans\\, we want to tell the story of Social Justice\\\".\\n\\nDoes anyone notice how polarizing The Last Jedi is? The people who hated it (like me) feel compelled to write bad reviews and make ourselves known in very loud ways because we despise this agenda. We've seen this social justice element in other movies\\, but now it's hit Star Wars and we just want it to stop. On the flip side\\, you got the social justice warriors and sympathetic progressives who feel compelled to defend this train wreck because it espouses their agenda. What a massive disappointment. I wish we could go back to the days of disagreeing on politics\\, but enjoying movies that steer clear of them.","true":true}
