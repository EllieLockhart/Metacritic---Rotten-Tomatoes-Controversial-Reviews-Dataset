Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst it isn't the worst film i have ever seen\\, it wasn't a great Star Wars movie by any stretch. I think that 2 of the prequels were actually a lot better. Perhaps Disney should have set the films far into the future or just created a new franchise. \\n\\nFirst i will start with the good things\\, Finn is pretty likeable\\, he has stuff to do this time and is pretty brave with good intentions. There are some really great effects both digital and practical\\, although the world's don't seem as rich as Lucas's . Some of the battles are quite good with one special effects sequence in particular being really fantastic. Also the Porgs were  decent. \\n\\nNegative things\\, characters seemed flat\\, Rey didn't seem to do much in The  Force Awakens\\, i don't think Daisy Ridley is a bad actor\\, she just never really has much to do. She learns everything very quickly and has no struggles or tribulations. Anakin and Luke screwed up left right and center. Luke was some jaded old man who isn't the hero we all know and love who had the heart of a lion and tried doing all he could to turn his evil father. He came across as weak and it sort of feels like Disney is wrecking old characters to force us to like the new ones\\, the issue is that the characters aren't very charismatic. Poe seems to be the stereotypical hot head\\, Rey doesn't do a lot\\, Kylo can be ok but is hot and cold\\, and Snoke is a total waste of time\\, he was built up then dispatched quickly. \\n\\nIf i'm honest it does feel  like a bit of a cash grab\\, the story ad plot points were uneven and some times pointless and the new characters lack gravitas. I had that feeling after the force awakens but i thought that it was because it was the first film and they didn't have a chance to get going. \\n\\nI'm not really hopeful for the future of Star Wars at Disney\\, i think they will over-saturate the market\\, run the brand in to the ground whilst alienating the core fan base. TFA and TLJ are the only Star Wars films i haven't and probably won't watch twice. \\n\\n and no i am not Alt Right lol","true":true}
