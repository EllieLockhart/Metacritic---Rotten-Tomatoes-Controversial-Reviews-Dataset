Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't even know what to say...I feel so disappointed. I liked The Force Awakens...But the Last Jedi lost the opportunity to make something epic...\\n- new characters are not interesting at all\\n- lots of cheesy jokes (i fear the future now that Disney controls everything: Marvel\\, Star Wars\\, etc...)\\n- lots of mystery are just dropped\\n- and a lot more that i can't say so i will not make spoilers...\\n\\nI thought i would never say this\\, but i am really considering not seeing anymore Star Wars movies in theatres...","true":true}
