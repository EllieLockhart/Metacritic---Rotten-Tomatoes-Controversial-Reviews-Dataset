The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Over the 20 hours of gameplay and exploration\\, including the tense moments of encounters with new infected creatures and new cults\/groups was amazing. The music in tense\\, sad or happy which made certain situations brilliant\\, music sometimes can break a game\\, but the style of music was just right. The story\\, it\u2019s clear that it is very difficult to creat a new character\/characters and try to create empathy for them like the community care for Joel and Ellie. However\\, once seeing Abby\u2019s POV and seeing who she was and what she has been through and lost in the past\\, also showing why she killed Joel does create empathy for her. Now in the 5-8 hours of seeing abby\u2019s life and showing the journey of the days 1-4 also including the past sometimes\\, it\u2019s worked what the game developers wanted to happen\\, at the end I didn\u2019t really want to kill Abby\\, due to seeing her perspective and seeing who she was. Now with Ellie the flashbacks where Joel is there really is very effective and sad and the way his face pops up every now then shows the fact that Ellie now misses him and wishes she could have spent more time with him. The end flash back including the bar flash back really made me get emotional\\, tears\\, because to find out that they only just wanted to work everything out\\, but it\u2019s sadly the day before Joel dies\\, it just hurt. This game has done really well to show emotion for characters and also I think it has a moral of the story\\, sort of like how this one thing made Ellie lose more then what she went in with\\, she lose Dina and JJ (we think)\\, Tommy and his wife broke up\\, Jessie dies\\, Ellie loses two fingers so can no longer play certain keys on the guitar\\, and sadly most of all she chose to lose time with Joel by not forgiving him and realising cons of what he did but not the pros. Not all endings are happy\\, but this ending was furthing  the point of what I said more or less (which is good and emotional). Overall a hugely emotional game\\, I am defo gonna play this game again just not now as I have to take it all in. I hope that a part 3 does come out in the years to come as I would love to see where Ellie goes and what people think of her at the city. I hope you all enjoy the game\\, also when playing it you real should read the notes found and listen to the dialogue and take it all in! Thank you for another great game Naughty Dog hope u bring a part 3.    her eyes\u2026 Expand","true":true}
