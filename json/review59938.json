The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Honestly\\, to actually use this plot to the sequel of an all-time-classic game is very\\, very bold. Players have high expectation for this sequel\\, they will only be happy with whatever experience TLoU1 brought to them. But still ND let Joel died early on\\, let you play the murderer of Joel as second protagonist. Obviously ND would like to make a point even fully aware of its cost\\, and I do admire their courage. I've read the reviews\\, haters\\, supporters and critics\\, I would still recommend this game whatever you say.\r\rExpectedly\\, ND presented best graphics in gaming so far\\, with stunning artwork and design\\, plus runs smoothly in PS4 pro. The details of the world\\, stories in those little notes\\, graffitis\\, destroyed modern city sets\\, are truly masterpiece. Sound effect is amazing with incredible details in this game\\, if you notice you'll be amazed.\r\rGameplay is largely the same with 1\\, which isn't really good or bad. The battles gradually become repetitive and uninviting in my opinion\\, looks to me they are mostly for the purpose of supporting a 25 hour benchmark.\r\rOK then the story\\, it shared the same issue with 1\\, and all other ND games - a lot of the smaller drama seems exaggerated or pushed\\, like watching a 7-scored US tv drama. There are choices that people in real world people normally wouldn't make\\, and hence emotions that couldn't resonate with players. However\\, I think what's admirable here is that\\, like all good stories\\, the storyteller attempted to convey something bigger than the story itself\\, in this aspect TLoU2 did a good job. The story dived deeply into the discussion of how different opinions among humans easily turns into fights and massacres\\, even among those with a kind heart\\, or with good intentions. The 2 protagonists share the same regarding where they came from (revenge)\\, had fierce fights\\, killed each others' loved ones\\, fought to near death for both\\, and eventually letting each other go. This revelation\\, despite the plot holes in order to achieve it\\, is heroic.\r\rSadly it's hard to balance everything with one story\\, we did lose consistent character arcs for almost all characters (some moments between Ellie and Joel is still touching)\\, empty new characters\\, and insufficient explanation for players who are expecting what will happen for the world in the game. I agree with many other reviews that Abby\\, being both the bad person and the secondary protagonist\\, needs way more backstory - however also not an easy thing though. So\\, I think it's already a decent balance of what the director wanted to say and deliver a consistent and convincing story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
