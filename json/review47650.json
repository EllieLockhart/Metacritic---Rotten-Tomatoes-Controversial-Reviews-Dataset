Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What you get if you take a Non-Star War's fan and make Star Wars movie? This is trash and feels like a big \\\"F-U\\\" to all fans. This needs to be deleted. This movie goes out of its way to be a stand-a-lone film when it's supposed to be part of a trilogy. For the life of me I don't get the reasoning here. This movies destroys the character development of nearly all cast members from what TFA established. WHY?!? This honestly feels like Rain Johnson never watched a SW film before or know anything about the world of Starwars.","true":true}
