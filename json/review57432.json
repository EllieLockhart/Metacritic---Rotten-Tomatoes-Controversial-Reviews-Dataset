Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awful. There is one cool scene\\, the chamber fight. The rest of this movie is filled with plot holes and poor character development. Everything JJ teased in Force Awakens was dismissed as meaningless in this movie\\, this felt more like a stand alone crap film than the second in a trilogy. There is literally zero reason to watch the next Star Wars film. I'm done with Star Wars\\, was a huge fan of the original\\, didn't think Ep 1\\, 2\\, and 3 were as bad as people think\\, but this movie was the worst of the bunch. I loved Rogue One\\, I may see Solo\\, but we will see\\, if it looks anything like this garbage\\, I'm done with Star Wars\\, I'd rather watch Lego Batman... The worst part of this film\\, is the desecration of the greatest Jedi of all time\\, Luke. He's reduced to an old\\, grovelling man who I imagine was the directors symbolism to old white rich men of America\\, we'll show them. The Liberal undertones are evident throughout this movie\\, and I'm a moderate (voted BO twice). I go to fiction movies for enjoyment\\, not to be pandered to by the left\\, OR the right! What happened to Sports Center will happen to these Disney movies if they're not careful. People will stop going to see these movies if they continue to have political undertones. Just like Luke\\, I'm OUT ----Fades away...","true":true}
