Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie like no other. It was about time they stirred up the pot and did something different\\, instead of rehashing old plot points. The world is further built up\\, and a grand story is told. great acting\\, great narrative\\, and great setup for the next installment.","true":true}
