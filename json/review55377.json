Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved seeing this new installment of Star Wars. The story is taking a different turn from the clear distinction between Good and Evil to everyone being a bit of both. The older characters are being replaced by the new. BB8 is in front to R2D2 in the back. Some scenes did strike as a little too childish. The makers should remember that most real Star Wars fans are very adult\\, and the makers should remember not too strike such an appeal to children. That being said\\, it is an interesting relationship between Ben Solo (Kylo REN) and Rey. I know big fans will be disappointed by the portrayal of Luke Skywalker because he was placed on a pedestal. But Luke was always a flawed character. Why should that change just because he is a Jedi Master? Yoda explains it during his appearance. Loved watching this film. ","true":true}
