Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I would miss George Lucas so much.\\n\\nThe humor\\, even when funny\\, works mostly to take you out of the moment starting in the first minutes.\\n\\nThe characters being forced upon us to embrace as the heroes only make matters worse for main story.  Most of the new characters give a forced likability and in some cases succeeds in only the opposite.\\n\\nLuke is handled very poorly his end aside.\\n\\nSnore was pointless.\\n\\nRey is boring and despite learning nothing knows everything.  The knowbody parents is probably the best part of the character.\\n\\nIt is not without a scene or two that are fun and exciting but far outweighed by the laughable and at time cringe enduring moments.","true":true}
