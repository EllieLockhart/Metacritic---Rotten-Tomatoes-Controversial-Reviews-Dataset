The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"From intentionally using a falsified trailer years ago\\, to making us play as the dreadful\\, hateful character Abby for however many hours\\, this game was a mess from the jump. it is nothing evenly remotely similar to its predecessor\\, which in many of our eyes was an absolute masterpiece\\, and probably the biggest letdown of 2020\\, and that's saying a lot. The fact that they killed the dude who\\, along with Ellie\\, made us so emotionally attached to the Last of Us Part One was such a despicable act of disrespect to any fans of the original game. Not only was Joel killed\\, he was literally tortured to death by a character many of us couldn't bear playing later on in the game for 10 hours or more. There is not a single redemptive factor about Abby except for maybe her 'saving' of Yara and Lev\\, despite NaughtyDog's vehement attempts to try and actually make her seem like a person instead of the absolute monster that she is. Also\\, NaughtyDog\\, the whole white savior thing\\, even if she is a woman who 'takes no **** has a heart\\, is built like an ox' blah blah blah\\, really wasn't the message to put out in today's day and age. Like come on I know you guys are a little smarter than that. Like don't get me wrong\\, there were some parts of the game I really enjoyed\\, such as the paleontologist's museum. A beautifully written and animated scene which was honestly tugged at the heart strings\\, especially the scene in the space shuttle. But it's only allowed to be beautiful because it's so strongly connected to the first game\\, and is a highlight of Joel and Ellie's relationship\\, which is both beautiful and cruel at the same time. I understand the message that you were trying to employ when you wrote the script\\, but the whole idea of 'revenge is bad and it'll only get you or your loved ones is so overdone'. This game could've been so much and more\\, but honestly\\, the plot was so flawed\\, and its execution of this plot was butchered. Did you guys see the end of Game of Thrones? Surely you could see what effect trying to 'subvert expectations' can have on any form of media\\, from film to games\\, on it's fanbase. Don't even get me started on those stupid god damn shock deaths. So ridiculous.\r\rIn review\\, remake the game\\, visit the roots of the last of us part one. Animators and coders\\, you did a stellar job\\, the game is smooth\\, fun to the run around even though there a lot of running around\\, and the combat is a class act.\r\rScriptwriters and a certain director who I hope never touch this series again? Do better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
