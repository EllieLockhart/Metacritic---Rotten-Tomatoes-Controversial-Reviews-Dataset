Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this movie feeling entertained. There were lots of flashy explosions\\, cool sound effects\\, great music...but the longer that I thought about the movie\\, the more I realized how much I absolutely hated the movie. It was obviously a movie made to sell a specific message: If you're a girl and you want to be powerful\\, Yoda will show up and retcon everything that the previous 7 movies (8 if you include Rogue One) has built: You have to work\\, learn\\, train\\, and change in order to become the best version of yourself. Rey is a Mary Sue. I really wanted to like her character\\, and I did enjoy her in VII because the amount of power she was exhibiting\\, coupled with the mystery of her parents\\, made it seem like she could be the spawn of two powerful Jedi. This movie took a complete dump on that and the answer is simply that Rey is super-powerful for no reason. There's a trumped up \\\"half-fact\\\" that retcons the whole concept of how the Force works\\, and they did everything possible to destroy any semblance of what the original character of Luke Skywalker was like. This culminated in the demise of a character that had given inspiration to many young people over the last four decades\\, and most definitely was NOT a good sendoff. Disney has stepped in it too far\\, and it's pretty debatable whether fans and moviegoers will give Solo or IX a second thought. Time to go back to what works\\, Disney\\, not try to destroy everything that took 40 years to build simply because it's inconvenient for your marketing plans.","true":true}
