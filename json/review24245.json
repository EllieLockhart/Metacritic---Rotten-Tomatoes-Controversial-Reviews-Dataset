Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. Super gigantic holes in the plot. Had some of the best moments of any Star Wars film along with a bunch of bad moments. The first hour of the film takes forever. Needs to be edited more.","true":true}
