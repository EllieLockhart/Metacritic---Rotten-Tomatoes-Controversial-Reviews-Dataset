Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing\\, almost seemed like a parody the first half of the movie. There are a few cool scenes but it enough to redeem it. The movie doesn't take itself seriously- more like a spaceballs entry. Many places like the casino didn't even feel like Star Wars\\, looked like it was right out of Vegas. The climax builds up and fizzles outnwith a lackluster duel and ride itself if characters without any kind of proper send off. Luke's activities since RotJ doesn't make a lot of sense and is disappointing that he's done literally nothing but be a hermit...If you want a real episode vi\\, vii\\, viii\\, then read the Thrawn trilogy...","true":true}
