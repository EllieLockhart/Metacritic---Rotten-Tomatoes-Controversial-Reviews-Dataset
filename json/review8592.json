{"101487":121352,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I just want everyone who is seeing this review to please do your homework. If you're listening to media and \\\"Professional critics\\\" on this movie for their review\\, please understand that they are hyping it up for being monetized\\, or benefiting in some way off of their positive review.\\n\\nI consider myself a very big Starwars fan and have watched every single movie that's come out so far. The original trilogy was and always will be fantasitc\\, and even the prequels I do enjoy despite not being the best. I do want to say this with complete wholeheartedness that I'm not writing this review as being on a \\\"hate train\\\" to just write badly about it because others have\\, this is my honest and unbiased opinion from the moment when I first saw the movie to walking out of the theater.\\n\\nI honestly feel after the first scene when the lightsaber that Luke took from Rey was tossed over his shoulder like some sort of slap-stick humor and no care in the world\\, that was basically saying \\\"F-you\\\" to the earlier movies and \\\"This is my movie\\, I'll do what I want with this now\\\". I didn't even laugh when he threw it and I started having this horrible feeling in my gut. I had heard about Mark Hamill doing some interviews and even saying that he fundamentally disagreed with the decisions made in this movie about Luke Skywalker\\, now I understand why. The total disrespect to his character and what he stood for was apparent and obvious and turned his character from a courageous and brave Jedi into an old\\, washed-up and cowardly man because... He saw a thought of Kylo when training him at the temple and saw some evil in him? That caused him to be this way? The same Luke that turned Darth Vader\\, the most ruthless and evil sith who killed countless people and still saw the good in him\\, but he see's Kylo having a bad dream with the dark side and decides to try and murder him? What the actual fuck? It made no sense how they portrayed him and very much disrespected him. \\n\\nThe whole movie seemed like it was trying to force humor into your face every 2-3 minutes and couldn't take any moment to be sincere. It felt like watching a marvel movie rather than Starwars\\, or just some sci-fi movie with Starwars characters in it. I don't understand the need to slap all this humor into each scene and completely undercut the tone of the film. The first order with Hux\\, they look like a total joke and you can't take them seriously. They all act like total morons and aren't intimidating at all. At least with the older stormtroopers\\, they were at least somewhat intimidating\\, especially with the emperor and vader. It was very obvious that the 'Porgs' in this movie were thrown in just so Disney can sell those as toys and merchandise\\, no actual plot development at all to the story. The whole story itself made NO SENSE at all. Since when is fuel an issue in the Starwars issue? The whole slow-chase going the same speed just to stay out of range was the most boring\\, pointless plot that was basically 80% of the movie. The side-plot of Finn and this new girl\\, Rose went on an even more pointless side-mission to find this guy to try and infiltrate the first order ship to disable the tracker and so on\\, which didn't even pay off. Again\\, I'm not here to complain about characters\\, but they honestly just threw this Asian girl in for racial diversity\\, which I'm not sure why that's even an issue in the first place. It seems like Holllywood feels an absolute NEED to keep throwing in racial diversity into movies. She had no character development\\, knew nothing about her\\, and was bland\\, boring\\, and had way too much screen time for someone who wasn't important. When on the casino planet\\, it turned into a political statement of \\\"animal abuse\\\" and rich people are evil and undertones of actual real-world agendas. If I want to see politics\\, I'll turn on the news\\, don't put that into a fucking fantasy movie\\, especially Starwars. \\n\\nSpeaking of political agendas\\, it's obvious they were making the men in the movie to be stupid\\, hot-headed\\, and arrogant and the women to be smart\\, strong\\, and justified with every moment. Even Poe's character was much different in this movie and he wasn't acting the same\\, making him look like a hot-head. I actually rolled my eyes in the theater and was pissed off when Leia used the force and FLEW back into the ship like Marry Poppins. Uhh.. She's never used the force before\\, was shot out of the ship with an explosion\\, in space for minutes and would have died\\, which I thought they were going to send her character off that way since she died in real life\\, but what the fuck? They kept her alive and she's still alive by the end of the movie. That was honestly a terrible decision because now how do you write her off in the next movie? She's dead in real life.. It made it more awkward and I feel very much disrespected Carrie Fisher.\\n\\nOh\\, Snoke was a big joke. They built him up from the previous movie of being this mysterious and very powerful leader that we had no idea his background\\, where he came from\\, or anything except that he was very powerful with the force. Oops\\, he died by Kylo so carelessly and easily. Guess you wont' ever know about him now. Even if somehow he's not 'dead' and is in the next movie\\, it totally writes off the build-up about him and just says \\\"fuck you\\\" to the fans. \\n\\nIt's official\\, Rey is a Marry Sue. Her parents are nobody\\, but she's just somehow amazing with the force\\, great at piloting despite not being a pilot\\, and basically does everything without a flaw. I was excited to see her have some sort of history of why she is powerful\\, but it was a lazy write-off just saying \\\"Oh the force is strong because anyone can use the force\\, so that's why she can do anything\\\" Which makes no sense. She never has any real challenges and you know she's going to be fine\\, which is no character development and is bland. I feel like the new characters in this movie have very weak character portrayal and storyline and they are just there because \\\"Oh\\, the force just makes you great!\\\" That's not how the force works.\\n\\nThe only moment of hope I had at the end when I saw Luke was hoping he would go out fighting like a badass. NOPE! Got fooled once again and then he isn't even there and is using this force ability to project himself.. And then he fucking dies anyway? What the actual fuck? This was the most pointless and idiotic way to kill off a character that so many people looked up to. I didn't care of the fact he died\\, it was the way they killed him off and made him useless in the end. \\n\\nThe whole movie was just an utter disgrace and I didn't even enjoy myself sitting there for 2 and a half hours. This is what I got from the movie they made as an honest opinion. The movie was filled with way too much humor and distracted the movie in a whole\\, there was an apparent SJW theme with a political agenda behind everything\\, TERRIBLE story-telling and writing\\, throwing away your favorite characters and just bringing in new ones and they aren't even interesting at all. It was try with what Kylo said\\, \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" which is exactly what Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have done\\, just trying to kill the past stories instead of adding to it and just saying \\\"Fuck you\\, we're going to make our own story and put our political agendas in it instead\\\". I honestly wish they would remake this movie and give us the REAL last jedi movie.\\n\\nFor those reading this and thinking \\\"Oh you're just a salty fan-boy who didn't like the direction they took of the movie\\\" You can go fuck off because I am a fan of the series and just because it's Starwars\\, I don't have to like it. The movie was terrible and had many issues with it that created more plot-holes\\, lack of plot altogether\\, lazy story-telling\\, and just literally say \\\"Fuck you\\\" to the fans. You should look up Kathleen Kennedy and her interviews and media pictures of her trying to push the SJW and feminism agenda on people. She even wore a shirt with 3 other girls in the picture that says on the shirt \\\"The force is female\\\". If that doesn't say \\\"fuck you\\\" to men\\, then I don't know what does. It's funny\\, because guys wore shirts that said \\\"The force is male\\\" then women would be outraged and we would be sexist\\, misogynistic\\, etc. Funny how there are double-standards. Anyway\\, after walking out of the movie\\, I felt so bad after watching that pile of garbage. I would honestly give this movie a solid 2\/10 at best. I was so disappointed and really do you take into consideration of my honest opinion.","true":true}
