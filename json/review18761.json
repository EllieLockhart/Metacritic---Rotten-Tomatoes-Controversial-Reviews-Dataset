Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a good movie\\, I know there's some plotholes and no answers yet\\, but that will wait on upcoming Episode IX. I think the audience is being too childish and they don't have a clue about Luke is not out of character since he made a mistake in the past.","true":true}
