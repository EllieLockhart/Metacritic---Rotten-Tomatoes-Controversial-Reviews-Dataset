Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My (spoiler free) thoughts on Star Wars: The Last Jedi -----\\n\\nThere are things that do and do not occur in this film that seem very illogical in connection to the story (with no logical explanation either). In terms of pacing\\, there are some REALLY cheesy\\, unnecessary parts...  But also some really cool scenes that seem out of place for when they occur. \\n\\nAll in all\\, it's a cool action \/ sci-fi movie\\, but a disappointing \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie in terms of the story and feeling connected to the plot and characters. The point of a sequel is to connect the dots\\, not add more and space them further apart. Now episode 9 will have to cram in A LOT of added things that Rian chose to neglect. \\n\\n6.5\/10","true":true}
