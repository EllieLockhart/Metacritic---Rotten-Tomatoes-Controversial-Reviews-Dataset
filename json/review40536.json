Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst of the series. Even worse than Attack of the Clones. One of those rare movies you wonder how it got made. Everything about it is wrong and feels forced. No fun to be had here. Johnson would be a better Star Trek director maybe cause he doesn't understand Star Wars.","true":true}
