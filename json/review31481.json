Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some star wars fans may not be happy that it wasn't the film they wanted\\, but both my fiance and I are massive fans of star wars\\, and we loved this film. Remember that many of these negative reviews are from people who are still annoyed that this wasn't the Thrawn Trillogy they'd always wanted\\, and most movie-goers won't even know who that is. Watch the film and let yourself form your own opinions. Don't let hard-liners from the old guard tell you what to think.","true":true}
