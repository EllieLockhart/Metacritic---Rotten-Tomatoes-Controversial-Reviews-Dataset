Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a giant middle finger to  Star Wars fans. This trilogy is effectively ruined by an egotistical writer\/director who thinks he know the universe better than anyone.\\n\\nPlot holes galore. Boring sub-plots. And if you had questions about who Snoke is\\, or who's Rey's parents might be - the answers are not there or are utterly disappointing. \\n\\nIt feels like Johnson took all the good work of Abrams from Force Awakens and took a lightsaber to it\\, leaving the Saga in tatters.\\n\\nThere is no coming back from this for the series.","true":true}
