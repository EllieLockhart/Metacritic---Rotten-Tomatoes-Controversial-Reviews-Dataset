Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, The Last Jedi was a visually amazing film. But the lack of direction\\, or questions answered leaves a hole in my stomach. The clear political agenda Disney has taken on these movies is appalling. Are male leads not allowed to come off as brave and strong without a female lead bringing them down or \\\"Saving\\\" them\\, or belittling them at every turn. The lack of sense canonically this movie makes with a true fans understanding of star wars is ridiculous. As Han Solo said it in The New Hope Remake TFA\\, \\\"That's not how the force works\\\".","true":true}
