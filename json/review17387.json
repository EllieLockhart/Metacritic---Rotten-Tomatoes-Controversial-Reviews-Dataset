Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it opening night\\, and am adding this after sleeping on it. Without spoling anything\\, I can say there are parts of the film I like\\, that moved me.  Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley play their parts very well\\, and are supported by the script. Oddly enough\\, BB8 is written well too.  Mark Hamill does an excellent job too\\, but the script was not with him. Not as badly let down as what Carrie Fisher had to deal with\\, however. As for the rest of it\\, I think I am more disappointed than angry. There are parsec wide plot holes\\, a lot of dialogue that made me physically cringe\\, obvious toy inclusions (Porgs) that took up too much screen time that could have been used elsewhere for characters...the list goes on. Perhaps if they had focused on the essential parts of the film\\, cut the filler\\, improved some of the worst dialogue and sacrificed an action sequence for real character development\\, it would have been a great film outright\\, rather than a merely adequate Star Wars episode. It's better than the prequels\\, worse than the Force Awakens (which I quite like)\\, and nothing next to the original trilogy.","true":true}
