Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You take one of the biggest characters in movie history\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and you minimalize his impact. The fact that Rey and Kylo had more power\\, and more impact\\, and more inspiration for the future of the universe than the Last Jedi himself\\, who defeated Darth Vader\\, is a freaking joke. I don't even want to get into the discussion of who all of the main characters were\\, and what that agenda was. Another joke. Last Star Wars I will pay for ever to see in the theater.","true":true}
