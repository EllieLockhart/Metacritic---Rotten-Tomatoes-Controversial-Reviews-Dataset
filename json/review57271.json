Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie helped me realize that the Force Awakens was a poor start for the trilogy\\, albeit an entertaining one. This trilogy desperately needed a second movie that would further explain what was going on\\, but instead the plot was nonsensical and didn't move the story further\\, the character development was poor\\, and it didn't feel like it belonged in this series. On a positive note\\, there were some nice visuals. I distinctly remember the silence when the movie ended and everyone in the theater got up and left without saying much.","true":true}
