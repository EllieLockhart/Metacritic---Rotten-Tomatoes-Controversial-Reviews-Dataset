Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't waste your time\\, especially if you are a fan of Star Wars.  This story is poorly thought out and the execution was even worse.  This movie isn't consistent with The Force Awakens\\,let alone the Original Trilogy. I had originally rated this movie as 1\/2 star but it was brought to my attention that anything less than a star isn't factored into the average on this site. When those reviews are taken into account\\, this move has an audience score of  like 24% ( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CWPAbKEmd5M )\\nI will not go see Solo A Star Wars Story\\,  Episode 9 or any of the Rian Johnson Trilogy in theaters or buy the Blu-Ray because of this movie. I am disappointed at all the sell out critics that pretend that is is a great movie.","true":true}
