Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i can stomach most of it but hate what  they did with the character of luke as it  shows that they no nothing about star wars i can say that they ruined the it for me i am now with a heavy heart off star wars \\, by the way only joined today here to give it a disappointment rating","true":true}
