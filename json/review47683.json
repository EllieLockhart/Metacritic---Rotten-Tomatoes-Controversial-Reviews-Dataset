Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When i first saw it i gave it  4.5 of 5. After seeing it the first time I ended up watching a ton of online reviews and angry fan reactions and my opinion started to sour.  I was starting to feel like I might have been to easy on it's faults. \\n\\nI decided to rewatch the original trilogy and I've just seen the last jedi for a 2nd time.  I went in thinking that i'd hate it and was ready to nitpick it apart.  But low and behold\\, watching it again just reaffirmed that my first impression was correct. In fact\\, I feel even better about it since some of the \\\"faults\\\" were me just missing certain dialog.
