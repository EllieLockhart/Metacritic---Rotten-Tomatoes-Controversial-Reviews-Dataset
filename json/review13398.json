Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" quite a bit. I did have some qualms about the use of humor and a couple of plot issues\\, but overall found it to be an intriguing entry in the saga.","true":true}
