Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To break it down as simple as possible. The Last Jedi is a great film. By no means does it deserve the hate that it's receiving and I think the reason why it's recieving the hate is because people didn't get what they expected. But when it comes to movies like this\\, we are not the writers of the film. The people who make these movies should not cater to our opinions. We're just along for the ride. Not driving the car. Now the film is great but it isn't flawless. For me\\, it only had one legitimate flaw and that was the Finn and Rose subplot. It was the weakest point of the film by far but other then that\\, there are a few things that can be nit picked but what's the point of doing that. If you nitpick a film your bound to be dissapointed. The Last Jedi is what a starwars film should be. A fun and enjoyable ride. I can see why some people are mad but I feel like as time goes on\\, the hate will turn into a appreciation for the direction it took the saga despite people hating it or not. We'll be thankful for the new things it explored. When the last Jedi is great it's GREAT but when it's bad\\, it's not so great. Like I said the canto Bight sequence was the biggest flaw but other then that\\, it's a fun and enjoyable film\\, and it did what it had to do.","true":true}
