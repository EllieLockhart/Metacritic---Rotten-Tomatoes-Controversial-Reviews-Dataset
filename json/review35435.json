Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi covered a wide range of emotions for me. I believe it takes us in the direction we need to go in order to have more rich and diverse experiences in this galaxy. Mark Hamill gives an amazing performance. The a movie is a lot to digest on the first viewing but repeated viewings add to the enjoyment. Go see it before someone tells you what happened.","true":true}
