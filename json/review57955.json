Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What total piece of crap. Can't you people write original stories with interesting characters. Kylo Ren is the only character whose name I remember the rest are totally forgettable.  That Vegas planet was fucking stupid whoever had that idea should be fired immediatly.","true":true}
