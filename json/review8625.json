Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Star Wars movie since the 97 re-release\\, that I haven't seen 10+ times in the opening 2 weeks. I've seen it twice. I cannot force myself to see it again. It's too.......depressing. Not an experience I want to have again. And that sucks. It's baffling the choices they made. Baffling.","true":true}
