Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an utter let down not only to me\\, but to the franchise as a whole and an insult to the rich legends material that disney has thrown to the way side in order to shove this bowl sewage down our throats. The pacing was terrible\\, the forced conflict was even worse and the weird Fin and Rose romance made me cringe. Although the humor did make me chuckle or laugh in the cinema\\, i almost immediately felt a sense of confusion as to why they made the decision to do it. Although i have even more gripes with the costume and weapon designs\\, it would take to long to voice them\\, I will however touch on the wasted characters and opportunities (without spoilers). The waste of major characters in this movie for no reason is absolutely abhorrent and was only a move to create shock value and nothing else\\, the change Rian Johnson has made an effort to try to change the formula of star wars and set the new trilogy apart\\, that i can respect\\, but the way he has disregarded the fan base\\, lore and the classic star wars \\\"feel\\\" makes me sick to my stomach and is making me reconsider whether to see the next film in the trilogy at all. In conclusion\\, this movie was not a bad one\\, it was however an atrocity towards the star wars franchise. Do yourself a favor\\, read the Ahsoka novel or Aftermath or the comics or literally any other piece of star wars literature or any movie\/TV show related to star wars instead\\, you'll have more fun. The special effects were extremely well done however.","true":true}
