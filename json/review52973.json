Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Rollatorcoaster ride the whole way through. The highs in the movie made it into my favorite moments in the saga. The lows left me sitting in my seat wishing this was the Empire clone some had feared.","true":true}
