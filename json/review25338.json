Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No\\, just no. This is all wrong. What have they done?!?! Why have they done this?!? Half a star for Mark Hamill who should have been shown more respect but did his best with what he was given. JJ will really have to perform a miracle with episode IX to save Star Wars.","true":true}
