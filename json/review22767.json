Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally the worst opus of the saga star wars. Zero scenario\\, flat actors\\, meaningless action. A bad parody of a star wars. How could Disney push this universe so low? In comparison the I\\, II\\, III are not so bad. At least they were grandiose. There it was just ridiculous.","true":true}
