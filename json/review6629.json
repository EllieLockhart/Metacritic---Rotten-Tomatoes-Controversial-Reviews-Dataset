Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not understand the love for this pretty but incredibly stupid wooden acted movie. I'm not a fan boy I don't really like the originals but with this one it's a SJW wet dream of a movie\\,  a feminist agenda so obviously politically correct in its intentions and box ticking exercise its embarrassing. The average joe will lap it up though and Disney is going to be rubbing its hands and making more of this dross by the bucket load\\, so in that sense it's a success and will keep the masses delighted.","true":true}
