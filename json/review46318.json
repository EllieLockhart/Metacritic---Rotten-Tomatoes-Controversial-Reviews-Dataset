Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was extremly excited for this film and saw it on opening night\\, not only did I leave the theater confused but the film killed my excitement for any future star wars films\\, aesthetically the film looks great but the rest of the film is full of logic holes and characters that make absolutely no sense and the overly politisized plot and subversion plot didnt do it for me.","true":true}
