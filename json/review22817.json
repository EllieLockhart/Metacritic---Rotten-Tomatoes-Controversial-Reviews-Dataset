Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOL at all these \\\"critics\\\" and \\\"reviewers\\\" saying that people who give this movie a low rating are bots and trolls. This is a bad star wars movie that is full of plot holes\\, unnecessary sideplots\\, and ridiculous scenes. Also\\, they ruined LUKE EFFIN SKYWALKER as a character -- seriously\\, the original trilogy and even the prequels have set up what people know about and expect about Luke Skywalker\\, the son of the \\\"chosen one\\\" and the person who redeems Darth Vader and saves the Skywalker saga and the galaxy. To reduce him to an alien drinking\\, pessimistic\\, and angry grumpy old man was sad. No wiseness? No serenity like Ben Kenobi and Yoda? Then truly if the last jedi Luke has been this bipolar hermit all along\\, the galaxy is in deep trouble. Fix this Disney!","true":true}
