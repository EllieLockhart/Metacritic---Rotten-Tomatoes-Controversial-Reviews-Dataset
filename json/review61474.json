We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"this is definitively a GOTY nominee for sure\\, the last of us part 2 is a true masterpiece with a very good story focusing on revenge instead of continuing to focus on love like part 1 did for the most part.\rinstead of the love and the growing friendship between Joel and Ellie like they did in part 1\\, Part 2 focuses more on the revenge path Ellie sets herself on after Abby Kills Joel. and we follow her on her journey as she goes down that path and slowly loses her humanity due to the rage.\rwith what feels like the only thing keeping her in check being Dina\\, her girlfriend.\rand as Ellie progresses trough the game and gets toward the end\\, when Abby gets to the cinema and confronts Ellie\\, Jesse\\, Tommy and Dina. shes starting to realize that this is not what Joel would have wanted. while Abby is about to kill Dina while Ellie is knocked down we see lev come in and save Dina by Abby seeing lev which calms her down. at the farm when jj is born Ellie is having nightmares and cant sleep\\, so she decides to go out and find Abby\\, and she eventually does find her hanged on a pole at a beach alongside Lev\\, and instead of just killing her there while she was defenseless she cut her down. after Abby was cut down she didn't have any strength\\, but instead of just attacking Ellie and taking her knife and killed her like she could have done\\, you could see Abby was ready to just leave and be done with everything\\, as we see again when they find the boats and Abby says shes not fighting Ellie anymore\\, that she and lev just want to be in a safe place. when Ellie threatened to kill lev by holding a  knife to his throat while unconscious Abby decides to fight Ellie just to save Lev\\, much like Joel would have done for Ellie and vice versa. after they battle\\, Ellie wins and is drowning Abby when she realizes that by killing Abby she wouldn't feel any better\\, it wouldn't make the pain and the memories go away\\, and that Ellie would be just like Abby if she did. so she takes her up and lets Abby go while she sits in the water Abby goes behind her to the boat\\, and she had the possibility to just go up behind her again and snap her neck\\, she didn't. and just left on the boat with lev.\ralso Abby and lev(also Yara) are like Joel and Ellie (and Tess and Sarah).\rJoel doesn't like Ellie at first\\, Lev doesn't like Abby at first\rEllie saves Joel (winter scene)\\, Abby saves Yara (amputation)\rJoel loses Sarah and tess\\, Lev loses Yara and Abby loses her dad\rat the end of the game Joel and Ellie are like family\\, Abby and lev are like family.\rboth the relationship between Abby and lev\\, and Joel and Ellie grows throughout the game.\r\rOverall this game is a 10\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
