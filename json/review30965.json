Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing and so disrespectful. I'm trying to embrace the latest trilogy\\, but TLJ has made it so hard. So many missed opportunities\\, involving both old and new characters. It's a film of nothing. Rey's parents\\, nothing. Snoke\\, nothing. That sub-plot\\, nothing. Character development\\, nope sorry. Even the big final duel is...nothing.\\nMark Hamill got it right when he said he fundamentally disagrees with their decisions involving Luke. It is just wrong.\\nThe plot holes are ridiculous. Why does the purple haired lady have to stay on the ship again? To look out the window and then punch a few commands into a console?! Get a droid to do It\\, or if you have to kill some one get Admiral Akbar to do it. At least we are emotionally invested in him. Another wasteful and disrespectful death for him.\\nThe humour is misplaced. Luke milking an alien is further humiliation. There is just so much wrong with this film. Rian and Kathleen Kennedy might as well have looked direct into the camera and said \\\"It's over for you guys. Star Wars is dead. Long live Disney Wars\\\"","true":true}
