Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a fake review\\, but I did create an account just to put this festering turd in its place.  I knew this movie was going to suck as soon as Luke threw the light saber over his shoulder.  Way to much attempt at comedy (and missed).  The dialogue was horrible.  Carrie Fischer was terrible.  The opening scene of galactic Jerky Boys was embarrassing.  This was so\\, so bad.  I wanted to leave\\, but too many people had their chairs reclined and I didn't want to upset their viewing.  At one point I looked around as though I went to the wrong movie.  This is easily the worst of any and all Star Wars movies...tied with Phantom Menace.  My mind is blown by the positive reviews.  I would be embarrassed to admit that I enjoyed this movie.  Rian Johnson should be embarrassed to admit that he wrote this movie.  While I loved the original trilogy (aside from the ewoks...who are actually tolerable now compared to Porgs)\\, I am not some obsessed\\, parent's basement-dwelling\\, costume-wearing fan boy.  What I am is a judge of all things quality\\, and this was not a quality movie...aside from destroying Star Wars canon.  Rian Johnson managed to destroy all the promise that Rogue One put into the Star Wars legacy.","true":true}
