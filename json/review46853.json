Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, this is not an average Star Wars movie.  It is a politically motivated\\, sexist propaganda movie which displays men are impulsive and evil while women are righteous and balanced.  Had this film come out a year earlier\\, it may even help Hilary wins the election.  No wonder JJ and Lucas opposed the direction of the movie\\, it is an ultra left wing\\, feminist movie for women.  As for the movie itself\\, it is like watching the entire series of Battlestar Galactica in just two and a half hours only more boring.  I did like the special effects and the new jedi powers being used which is why I am giving it 2\/5.","true":true}
