Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider this film quite different from The Force Awakens...There's a lot of questions that I asked throughout the film\\, but i believe they'll be answered in the next Star Wars! :) Overall\\, I enjoyed it a lot! Started off a little boring but became very exciting.","true":true}
