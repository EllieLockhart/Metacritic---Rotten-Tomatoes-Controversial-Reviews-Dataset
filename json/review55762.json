Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot points made little sense\\, \\\"twists\\\" were forced and all character actions felt compulsory to advance some plot agenda rather than logical in the context of the character's perspective. It's clear that many of the decisions in this were made in an effort only to push merchandising decisions and it seems like late script changes might have been made to immortalize Carrie Fischer despite not fitting the story.","true":true}
