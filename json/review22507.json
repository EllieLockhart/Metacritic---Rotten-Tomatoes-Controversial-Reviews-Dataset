Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me just start by saying ok\\, yes\\, this was most definitely overhyped. The movie is far from perfect and I had issues with how the story leaves us to bridge the conclusion to the trilogy. The murky middle section (although still intriguing with the conflict between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, which had me on edge) does kind of drag on and the end was corny and felt a bit flat to me. But a lot of these fans are just a little much. Nothing is 'terribly' disappointing. There was some amazing moments here (SPOILER ALERT: FKN YODA YO!! EEE) terrific action scenes\\, great humor\\, beautiful visual work and strong acting\\, especially by Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Mark Hamill in the actual performance of his career.  A very solid entry in the Star Wars franchise and proper farewell to Carrie Fisher. The absolute brutal negativity I'm seeing is unjustified to me. 56%? Really? \\nGood grief.\\n\\n***1\/2","true":true}
