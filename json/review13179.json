Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't review movies often\\, but this Star Wars is one of them. The movie is a complete disappointment if you expect any type of revelation as portrayed in the trailer. \\n\\nThe action sequences are OK\\, the opener if given a little thought is just stupid. Why would you bomb something in space? \\n\\nAny type of answer to questions fans may have are teased at then pulled away. \\n\\nIt appears that the writers and director were more in love with the Millennium Falcon than any other character in the movie.\\n\\nThe few positives are that they address how Kylo Ren was beaten by Rye\\, and how Luke being isolated does not solve any problems in the Force Awakens. \\n\\nOtherwise\\, if you ever wondered what the Empire Strikes Back would look like with out all of the good stuff in it\\, your question will be answered.\\n\\nThe critic consensus is definitely wrong here.","true":true}
