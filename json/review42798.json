Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was \\\"Meh\\\" at best. Slightly better than Phantom Menace (also 2 stars). The entire Casino scene was terribly slow and unnecessary. The only redeeming portion of the film was the bombing run space battle and the fight in Smokes throne room. The rest could have been scrapped. Should have borrowed more from the now non-canon \\\"Legends\\\" books.","true":true}
