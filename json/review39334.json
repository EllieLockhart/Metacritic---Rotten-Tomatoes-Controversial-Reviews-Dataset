Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is beyond terrible as story and character development goes. I left the cinema gobsmacked at just how bad it is. Took my 9 year old son with me to see it as after watching episodes 1-7 he was really into Star Wars and now hes turned to the marvel movies. That must say something!!!!","true":true}
