Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So bad.\\n\\nI'm not a Star Wars basement-dweller zealot\\, but I am a nerd person. I like films like Star Wars because of nerding. The problem is that this film was so stupid\\, and made zero attempt to be a science fiction film. I wanted a fun space movie\\, instead I got beach alien lactation. I couldn't care less about what they did or didn't do with Luke's character. I just wish the movie hadn't been so awful. There's no way a competent villain or a competent rebellion would have done ANYTHING that they did in this movie.","true":true}
