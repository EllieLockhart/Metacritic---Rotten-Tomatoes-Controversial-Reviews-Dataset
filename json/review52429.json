Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Great Movie\\, no I mean how they did it was perfect. But they broke the \\\"Chekhov's gun law\\\" with the storyline. A great movie with a lot of content and twist\\, but ok storyline.","true":true}
