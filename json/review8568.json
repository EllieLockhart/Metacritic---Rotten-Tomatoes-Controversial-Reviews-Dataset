Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, did not feel like a Star Wars movie. As a stand alone movie I\u2019d maybe give it 2.5 stars but the plot was dry as can be. I feel as if they forced some comedy in spots where it didn\u2019t belong. Cheesy one liners ruined action scenes for me. Overall just one big mess of a movie. Disney you have officially ended my interest in Star Wars.","true":true}
