Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll need to see it again so the novelty wears off before I can say whether this is my favorite Star Wars movie or just top 3\\, but I loved it.\\n\\nAdam Driver is totally compelling\\, and as likable as an evil fanatic can be. Strong performances by Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill remind me how wonderful the original films were\\, but also add strength and depth to the new stories. Aesthetically lovely and intimidating\\, and philosophically challenging\\, TLJ captures much of the essence of The Empire Strikes Back without falling into the derivative mold of The Force Awakens.","true":true}
