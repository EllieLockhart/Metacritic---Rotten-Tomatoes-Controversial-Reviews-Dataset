Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Updated just to add this comment.  Does anyone else find it fishy that the reviews can easily be tallied to be well into the 30's by users yet the displayed Audience Score is still sitting EXACTLY at 49?  I mean lets just assume that some are fake.... but still isn't it odd it is pinned at that number for so long now?\\n\\nWell..... the writing on this one is bizarre at best.  The only thing saving it from 1\/2 star from me is the acting and the fact that it is Star Wars.  I have no idea what JJ is going to do in the 3rd film of this series.  It feels like they should make a 4th movie and just spend the 3rd cleaning up the story mess they made in this one.  I am very confused how the critics rated this so high with such poor writing?\\n\\nSecondary Thought....  Much like the prequels I have no intention of picking this up on Bluray etc.  which is odd considering I own the TFA in multiple formats.  So what happens if the next one is good?  I just have a hole in my set lol?  I can't believe how irritating the writing was on this one.  OH\\, and for all the people trying to spread false information\\, I am not a bot or someone that is trying to subvert something.  This is just my honest opinion of this movie.  Pretty sad to say there is bad writing in a Star Wars movie.  That's saying a lot lol.","true":true}
