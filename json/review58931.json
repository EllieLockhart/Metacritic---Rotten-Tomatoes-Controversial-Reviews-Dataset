This game is dead on arrival and tarnish anything the original was.  7 years and waiting.... And I'm not even fully complete with the game yet.  I feel ripped off as if this game should even exist. Having a difficult time finishing it. Really hope the future of gaming doesn't turn out to be  Like this game.  What also made me upset was the Mega critics big time critics given this game a 10 outta 10  Which is completely false on every level.   It's disrespectful and misleading to every gamer that wants an honest review so for a lot of these companies to score this game a 10 outta 10 is disgraceful.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
