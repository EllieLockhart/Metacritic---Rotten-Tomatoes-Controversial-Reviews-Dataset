Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it and can't wait to take my niece to watch it with me this weekend. The plot was fun\\, well paced and explores situations we haven't dealt before in a Star Wars movie. At its core\\, this movie is about PEOPLE\\, what they believe is the right and maturing from their mistakes. Visuals were stunning\\, and actually made my jaw drop a couple of times. The music is always superb. Sure\\, it has its flaws but they are not deal-breaking. A fair warning tho... If you haven't watched The Clone Wars series\\, Star Wars Rebels or read the novels\\, you will find some stuff with the Force a little far-fetched. Believe me\\, it is not. This just goes along the same lines of \\\"nothing is impossible to the Force\\\".  In any case\\, the movie leaves us wondering how they are going to handle Episode IX... For the first time\\, I really don't know what to expect.","true":true}
