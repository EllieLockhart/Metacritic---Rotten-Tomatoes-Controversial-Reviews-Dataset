Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see the movie with my father who grew up with the original trilogy and me the prequels. We were both significantly alienated by the incoherent story line. Wish RJ had done a better job. Oh well\\, at least we can appreciate the simple yet focused story telling of the mandalorian. P.s- please stay away from Star Wars RJ ","true":true}
