Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fun\\, beautifully shot\\, Star Wars movie. It's been awhile since I had a experience that legitimately thrilled and astonished me in theaters.  Moreover\\, there are some fun seeds of thought interwoven in the stories structure that are exciting to discuss over a coffee afterwards with friends.","true":true}
