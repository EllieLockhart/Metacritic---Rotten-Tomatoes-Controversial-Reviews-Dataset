Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi! This movie was an overall amazing movie\\, with incredible special effects! A solid 9.0\/10.0 movie! Sure some parts of the movie slacked like the plot with Finn was very boring at times. Luke Skywalker and his plot was incredible\\, Mark Hamill had a very solid performance. The ending of the movie was very good! The only problem is I wish it would of ended sooner. When Luke was with Kylo I thought they should of ended it there\\, instead of having the kid. They really \\\"trolled\\\" us with Rey's parents. They shouldn't of spent so much time on it in the movie\\, Kylo sure did crush our dreams! I saw The Last Jedi at 7pm on 12-14-17 and it was truely an awesome experiance and was glad to be apart of the Hype thats why I give Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 4.5\/5.0 Stars!","true":true}
