Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Conceptually\\, it'S AN INTERESTING APPROACH TO MOVE ON THEMATICALLY FROM THE MOVIES UNTIL NOW\\, BUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE NEW TRILOGY\\, BRIDGING THE PREVIOUS MOVIES\\, SEEMS AN AWFULLY STRANGE TIME TO DO THAT. The real problems with this movie ULTIMATELY boil down is simply poorly DEVELOPED characters & a poorly told story.","true":true}
