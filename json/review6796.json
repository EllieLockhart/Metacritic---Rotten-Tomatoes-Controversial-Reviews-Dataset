{"101487":117261,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-12","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dont sip the kool aid on this one. All the praise is from paid critics\\, brand loyalty hacks who would pay for shit in a bucket if it had a star wars logo on it\\, or people who just dont understand star wars. The only good thing about this film is the cinematography\\, everything looks beautiful and incredibly realistic and yet all the immersion is ruined by just how terrible everything else is. Once you refuse to shut off your brain and see past the effects it becomes painfully obvious. The humor here is of thousandfold cringe compared to any attempts made in The Phantom Menace. The film is just that bad that it brings down not only itself but the sequel trilogy as a whole\\, and furthermore doesn't seem consistent with the larger star wars lore or any of the previous films. Jedi training is no longer required and a rookie can now best a master in a scuffle. Luke Skywalker has become so utterly unrecognizable as a character that even Mark Hamill had to express his distaste for this film and referred to his character instead as Jake Skywalker. Yes he retracted his comments\\, but this was only done at the bidding of his superiors. Some of the only things that stopped the previous film from being a tired rehash of the original 77 film were the interest of Snoke and Rey's origins. These points are discarded in the new film as if they were as expendable as a random stormtrooper. Subversion in this film exists only for the sake of subversion\\, just as everything in this trilogy only seems to exist for its own sake and serve no greater purpose\\, much unlike the cohesive epic told by the original 6 films. Say what you will about the prequels but they still told an important background to the events of the OT and the lore as a whole. TLJ seems to have been made by contrarian hacks that think they're so clever as they laugh and pat themselves on the back all the way to the bank with your hard earned cash. The makers of the film seem to have not watched any of the Star Wars films before the sequel trilogy and don't even seemed to have watched the Force Awakens\\, as this film seems disjointed to it. The new trilogy doesn't have that cohesive\\,planned feel of Lucas' vision and instead seems like they're just winging it as they go\\, resulting in what feels like a poor improv and the weakest yet of the 3 trilogies. Episode 9 is still yet to come out but I really dont see them making a comeback from this one.\\n\\n\\\"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians\\, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior\\, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\\"when life begins\\\" or \\\"when it should be appropriately terminated\\,\\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.\\\"-George Lucas\\n\\nWhat has been done here feels like precisely that\\, the work of barbarians who seek nothing more than to exercise their power in destroying a cultural heritage loved the world over for many decades\\, all for the sake of profit. As a lifelong fan of Star Wars since that fateful life changing day 17 years ago when I was only 3 years old and first saw ANH\\, I never imagined I would live to see the day when the franchise has become such a poor mockery of itself. Perhaps it is just me\\, but the quote in the film about letting the past die even seems like a subtle jab done in extremely poor taste at those who would reject the new direction. The future is always ripe for the planting of a fresh direction\\, but for a tree to grow strong it must have strong roots as well. Without the roots\\, the tree will wither and die. Disney's discarding of the EU was one thing\\, but to turn Luke into a character unrecognizable compared to the OT\\, along with the futile attempt to rehash it\\, truly proved once and for all they dont respect the roots. People claim that with time this film will be seen in the same light as The Empire Strikes Back\\, you will all feel stupid years from now when the hype has died and the film is universally hated\\, and then you will hypocritically claim to have despised it all along. This move is not only an insult to fans\\, but also to Mark Hamill and especially Carrie Fisher who deserved a swansong more fitting for a Princess. An utter desecration and vandalization of star wars that feels like a hate letter to all who ever cared for it. I could go on about why this film is terrible but if what I've already said wont convince you then I dont know what will.","true":true}
