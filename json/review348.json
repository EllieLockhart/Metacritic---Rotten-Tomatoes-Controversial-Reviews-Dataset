It has been up to this point that I have wondered how would it turn out if such stunning effect were applied to a game in the horror genre (Life is Strange is largely fantasy\\, and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is largely science fiction)?  Until Dawn answers this question.\r\rIn the game you follow a story that is pure classic horror\\, recalling such masters as Wes Craven\\, John Carpenter\\, Sean Cunningham\\, George A Romero and many more.  The story sprawls between a number of main plot threads with you controlling a series of characters and partaking in decisions to situations that may not only have immediate ramifications\\, but may and will alter the outcome of the game as a total.  Control of the characters is kept to a strict limit\\, with them effectively being a 'cursor' or 'guide' in the gameplay segments\\, solving simple puzzles and being involved in action sequences that use quicktime events.\r\rThe presentation is outright stunning\\, the graphics detailing amazing facial reactions to the characters - a lot of the game is spent in conversation and if the graphics were not up to the task\\, it honestly would have suffered.  Also of note are the lighting effects and the improvised 'camerawork' to action sequence and tense moments - someone's clearly done their homework and it shows\\, for this not only reveals an understanding of the horror genre\\, but in how movies work.  If anything does suffer\\, its the occasional framerate stutter or slip\\, and its a (very) minor slip.\r\rSound also excels with a stellar arrangement that whilst not providing any signature melodies\\, piles on the tension and pressure when it needs to.  The voice acting is of a really high standard\\, and there's only an occasional bad dialogue (this is extremely rare).\r\rThe gameplay has to rely on a combination of good plot and enough involvement to keep the player going\\, and thankfully it more than gives in this area.  The plot sprawls and never fails to enthrall\\, whilst the execution of tense and action moments is beautifully executed.  Then there's the added fact that the choices you make in the gameplay affect the game greatly - I'm on my second playthrough currently\\, and honestly there are a HUGE amount of differences in the plot.\r\rThis of course will come down to your enjoyment of the genre\\, and how the game plays-out (it is effectively an interactive movie).  For me\\, I loved the sheer offset nature of the whole game.  On one hand\\, I am being led on a path in which I make choices to affect future actions\\, but on the other hand I am presented with a wide range of choices I have to make in order to try and keep everyone alive - and that also includes how I react and perform when I am asked to\\, with no exceptions if I get it wrong.\r\rA superb game that may not appeal to action junkies\\, but for veteran horror fans and anyone who enjoys the 'interactive movie' style of game\\, this is definately for you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
