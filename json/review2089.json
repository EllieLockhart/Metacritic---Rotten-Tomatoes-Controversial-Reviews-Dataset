Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A steaming pile of shit.\\nFrom beginning to end\\, it seems nobody really understood anything at all about Star Wars. From the misuse of purpose-built ships like the B and A wings\\, to the seeming lack of a need for training to use the force so long as you have a uterus\\, to the poor pacing\\, unlikeable characters\\, and the missed opportunity to make one dimensional characters like Rey and Finn have some actual characterization\\, this film was an absolute insult to everything that came before it from beginning to end. I've been a Star Wars fan for 20 years\\, and I left the theatre feeling a deep despair\\, a rage I didn't know I had in me\\, and intensely insulted.","true":true}
