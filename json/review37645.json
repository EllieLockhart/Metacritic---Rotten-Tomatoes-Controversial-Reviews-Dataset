Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's absolutely no way this could have a 49% user rating with all the 1\/2 and 1 star reviews. This is proof that the rating system at RT is completely rigged. I saw this film opening night and many weeks later\\, I'm still angry about it. Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and the whole gang at Disney completely destroyed the Star Wars saga with TLJ. The plot was full of holes. Apparently\\, there is gravity in space and Leia is now Superman. Luke is an angry as*hole who would rather hide in solitude\\, sucking space cow milk and spear fishing than helping his sister and the rebellion. btw - why wouldn't Luke just lift the fish out of the water using the force than jumping across a canyon with a huge spear? Also\\, now the force can be used to survive space\\, control lightning\\, and project yourself across a galaxy. If this was true\\, why wouldn't Luke\\, Obi-Wan\\, or Yoda project themselves behind the Emperor \/ Snoke and strike them down with lightning? What a ridiculous farce. The entire movie sucked as* and the creative team (**points finger at Rian Johnson**) should be ashamed of this film. Absolutely the worst PC piece of crap I've ever seen in my life. Horrible as a Star Wars movie\\, even worse if it was a stand alone film. Also\\, don't get me started about Rose Rose Binks. All characters and story lines destroyed from the entertaining TFA. I can't imagine how JJ Abrams and George Lucas could praise this garbage. JJ Abrams is now tasked with finding a way to ignore this mess and build something decent from the rubble. As for me\\, this is the last SW movie I will pay to see in theatres. I loved Rogue One and liked TFA\\, but hated TLJ. Goodbye Star Wars\\, I've loved you for 40 years and now it is time for a divorce.","true":true}
