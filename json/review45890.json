Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very well done. I think they told a new story while keeping very much in line with the spirit of Star Wars. I thought the move had the right mix humor\\, angst and darkness. I was riveted by how the writers and directors would wind down the Han Solo\\, Leia and Luke stories\\, passing it along to the next generation. Daisy Ridley was terrific. It was also poignant the way they helped Poe\\, Finn and Rey\\, to learn that they still have much to learn\\, and to remember it's not just about who fights and dies\\, but it is how you live. \\nI'm glad that these stories will continue\\, because I clearly remember right after watching A New Hope in 1977\\, how badly I wanted to know what happened next. I remember that I did not want it to end.","true":true}
