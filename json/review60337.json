We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"i walked into this game with an open mind & the benefit of the doubt. i knew about the leaks\\, but i chose not to believe them. joke's on me. EVERYONE felt so out of character. joel's death was awful and insulting\\, but maybe i could've looked past that if the story got better. spoiler alert\\, it didn't.the heart of the last of us was ellie & joel's relationship. and then you tell me that ellie's been mad at joel for YEARS? and then joel gets killed by a bunch of characters we couldn't care less about? not to mention\\, it was extremely convenient how they found him. and by extrememly convenient\\, i mean lazy storytelling. another thing that bugged me was how ellie & tom's grief was depicted. sure\\, this whole game is that they both make it their sole mission to get revenge\\, but they didn't feel like they were grieving (until the very end\\, but the end is a whole OTHER story). and abby. goddamn abby. listen\\, i know what they were trying to do. but they failed. abby's character is not likeable at all (none of her friends are\\, either). her story might've been the game's attempt at making us see her side\\, but it felt like an aggravation. her father was willing to KILL A KID. A KID WHO WOULD'VE PROBABLY DIED FOR NOTHING. because there WERE others like ellie\\, but for some reason this game forgot about that.  and the ending was just. hollow. it leaves you feeling empty\\, and not the good empty. heck\\, if it ended at the point where ellie & dina were living in their little farm i could've digested it. but it dragged on and on and ellie lost EVERYTHING and for WHAT? to drive in that 'revenge is bad'? that's a too cliche lesson that is NOT worth all that was lost. ellie deserved better than just walking into the woods alone to god knows where. it's like the developers missed the WHOLE point of why people liked the last of us. personally\\, i loved TLOU because of its story\\, a story about two people who couldn't be more different finding each other in a world with no mercy. how no matter how awful things got\\, they had each other. i loved TLOU because of its message of love and hope and found family. TLOU2 was bleak and about hate and never felt like it was a sequal to the last of us. they tried to flip the script\\, do something new\\, and it failed miserably. i could never accept this mess as canon. on the other hand\\, i have to give the actors & animators & world builders credit. they did a wonderful job. the gameplay was good\\, albeit a bit repititive. but it wasn't worth it. they should've just taken the success of the first one and left. it's a shame.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
