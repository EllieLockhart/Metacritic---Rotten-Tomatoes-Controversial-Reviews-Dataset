Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi will be the last star wars film i will go to the theaters for.  The film was terrible.  You leave the film with all the questions from the force awakens still unanswered.  The scene with princess lea flying thru space why?  We lost admiral ackbar in this same scene after im blown away a single x wing can take out all the gunners on the first order ship.  The cheesy comedy between hux and poe over the speaker was not needed.  The last resistance ship being just far away from a star destroyer that apparently flies at the same speed was dumb.  Its like disney got the technology of pirates of the Caribbean confused with star wars these are space ships not sail ships.  Luke skywalker..... I can see why mark hamil openly bashed the new films.  Its not his fault the director decided to go rogue and trash the cannon lucas laid out for disney.  Luke and this whole new trilogy has been cheated out of the potential greatness star wars can and should be.  Its now been turned into something that feels nothing like star wars besides the characters and ships.  Failure is the theme of the film and it failed to for fill my expectations.  I can wait for 9 to come out on video theres nothing left that interest me.","true":true}
