Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has it's flaws\\, but nonetheless I think it's a great Star Wars movie. In fact\\, maybe better that some of the Original Trilogy. People complaining about the humor propably don't remember Ewoks or Jar-Jar. After all Star Wars was always for children\\, yet The Last Jedi delivers perfectly some pretty dark scenes. Of course there are some quite silly situations\\, but it didn't disturb me from being amazed by all the sick twists and characters\\, who are so much better developed than in The Force Awakens. I hope that people will stop hating on this movie and start actually enjoying it\\, because it's definitely one of the best ones in the saga","true":true}
