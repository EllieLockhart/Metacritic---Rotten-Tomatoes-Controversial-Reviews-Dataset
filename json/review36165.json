Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" was essentially a slow\\, boring toy advertisement.  In episode 8\\, we discover somehow the Rebellion has been gone from a fighting force that has destroyed three Imperial planet-killing bases\\, to a tiny band in three inconsequential ships.  It quickly becomes clear that it was due to Poe's piss poor leadership.  Meanwhile\\, Finn's storyline literally did nothing to advance the plot\\, while Rey made shadowpuppets with Bed from across the galaxy.  Turns out everyone wanted Luke...because he could act like a hologram.  POS","true":true}
