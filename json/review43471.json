Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a triumph. It takes major balls to deliver a story such as what The Last Jedi gave us\\, and i would like to commend all responsible for their bravery. Though many may hate the change\\, this film brings a much needed fresh take on Star Wars\\, which enhances the entire franchise.","true":true}
