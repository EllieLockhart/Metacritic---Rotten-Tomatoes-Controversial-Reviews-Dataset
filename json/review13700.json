Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally saw this film\\, via illegal bit-torrent download. Many friends (diehard Star Wars fans themselves) told me to skip it. I should have listened. I held out for a year\\, but my curiosity got the best of me -- like driving by the scene of a horrific automobile accident\\, I just had to look. Anyway... this film was clearly an act of deliberate sabotage\\, and the fact that it was green-lit\\, is a dismal reflection on where we're at culturally in the US of A. Rian Johnson should be shipped in a box (with a few small breathing holes) to Abu Dhabi. Kathleen Kennedy too\\, for that matter. Fit 'em both in one box\\, and good riddance. I will be avoiding episode 9 like the plague\\, and everything else STAR WARS from here on out. RJ killed the franchise; he's a terrorist as far as I'm concerned. At least we'll always have six excellent George Lucas driven films. Rewatch\\, rewatch\\, rewatch... and repeat (for a guaranteed FEEL GOOD). I gave this atrocity here one star\\, for John Williams score. And I'm not a bot\\, you idiots. And I'm not a Republican hate-monger either\\, you soulless scum...","true":true}
