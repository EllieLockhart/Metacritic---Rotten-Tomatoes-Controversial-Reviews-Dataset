Gameplay\\, character development\\, graphs were incredible. However the biggest flaw was the story\\, level design and passing.The Last of Us is a very liner game so I didn't expect much of a sandbox open world game. But the second level of the game takes you in the begining of Settle riding on horse back. Seeing and visiting almost every building you see with a clear objective was incredible. However as the levels continue the map of the new area become smaller and smaller to the point of going back to the original game roots. This makes the game experience lacking compered to what they could of done vs what they actually did. The level designs ranges about 3 hours per new area you visit but is it fun and exciting. Yes you do have some areas you can visit but getting through each area are the same as the last one you entered. Either kill all the enemies or sneak by them. Rise and repeat for 5 more times. This process made the game longer to fit a big game title but for enjoyment that answer is no.The story process by you playing as Ellie and after each brief you are awarded a flashback. These flashback are tells the time Ellie spend with Joal but provide very little in both gameplay and plo. After half of the came you play as Abby and again like Ellie after each  you'll get a flashback or a new feature are dreams which just like the flashback provides almost nothing. Each flashback can be explained in the story by simpling having character talk to each other. In fact the whole story of revange can be resolved by having character talk it out with each other.If you think the game is slow\\, taxing\\, and boring just wait for the ending. This game likes how it looks so much that it will linger on which several minutes has pass so you can enjoy it rather than playing the game. This creates an  illusion that you are finished with this game\\, throw away some trash\\, use the restroom\\, get a snack and there's another scene apparently.In short The Last of Us part 2 is a good game but not a Last of Us good game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
