Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of the CGI. As a Huge Star Wars Fan\\, I have to say. This movie is pointless and a waste of time. The writer of this movie is an idiot and has destroyed everything that Star Wars was built on. If you haven't seen this movie and you are a Big Star Wars fan. Don't waste your time or money. This movie is horrible.","true":true}
