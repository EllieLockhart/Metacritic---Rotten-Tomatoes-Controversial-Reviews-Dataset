Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers below:\\n\\n****** \\n\\nThe main villain(most interesting character in my opinion) gets clumsily killed off. \\nLuke's role is idiotic at best (even Mark Hamill himself has said so).\\n\\nThere's many cringe worthy moments in the movie. \\nSo of the actors\/actresses in the movie are very average at best.\\n\\nWorst Star Wars movie I've seen (Haven't seen Solo yet...)\\n\\nI got no idea how their supposed to get a good plot for the next movie from this pile of garbage lol","true":true}
