Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie......horrendously boring. It wasn't even good as a standalone film. I really wanted to like this movie and I even enjoy the prequels in all their mess and glory but the utter disregard and disrespect to the original material was so baffling and disgusting I really hope they leave Star Wars alone. I rather have them stop at the prequels if it me they wouldn't destroy this story with such trash. \\n\\nI'm completely baffled at the great divide between the critics and audiences reviews. How is it that with the ratio of \\ngood to bad reviews of this film that the aud\\nience rating is still hanging on to 50%?! Rotten Tomatoes not allowed to let the true rating show due to contractual obligations to Disney?! Please save your money folks. It's a shame that I was so pumped for this movie and now I have no interest to see the next episode because they have given us nothing to look forward to.","true":true}
