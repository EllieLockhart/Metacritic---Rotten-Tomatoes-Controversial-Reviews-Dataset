Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the movie actually angry.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy clearl.  I don't understand the hero's journey that made Star Wars great.  They replaced substance with virtue signaling. \\n\\n I don't see how Disney can correct this mess.   Star Wars wasn't just a bunch of action movies like Marvel comics.  You might have just killed the brand forever.  Clearly you can't give Rian Johnson another trilogy.","true":true}
