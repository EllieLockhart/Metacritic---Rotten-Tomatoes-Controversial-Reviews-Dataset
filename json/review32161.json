Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoolers ahead. Boy\\, it's hard to make you people happy. For TFA\\, the complaints were that it was too much of the same. They give us a very different film\\, and now it's too different. \\n  I thoroughly enjoyed TLJ.   There was a feeling of some things that came full circle\\, while leaving other circles to be completed in the next film. \\n  The comedic elements left me laughing enough to break up the tension of the chase and the emotions of the film. \\n  I will admit\\, I was a bit surprised that Snoke met such a sudden end\\, but I am willing to bet that his story and death will have a purpose in IX. Like with all Star Wars films\\, there are answers we have to wait for. Be patient.","true":true}
