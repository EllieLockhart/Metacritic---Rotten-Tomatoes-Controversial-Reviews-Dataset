Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The pacing was off\\, there was no internal logic regarding physics they have established themselves\\, inappropriate Slapstick\\, cheap use of clichees\\, characters not making any sense and all around not a good time\\, i have i would not have seen it\\, becauser as a star wars fan myself i feel ridiculed and embarassed\\, i dearly hope this movie gets a redcon. I am going to be honest\\, every critic recommending this movie in my mind has to be bought since even though the movie has a great Looks incredible Music\\, and more or less good effects\\, the plot itself is severly lacking\\, that being an Understatement.\\nI hope this Review was somewhat helpful to anyone reading it\\, i do not think im going to go and see the next one in cinemas\\, if i see it at all. Have a nice day","true":true}
