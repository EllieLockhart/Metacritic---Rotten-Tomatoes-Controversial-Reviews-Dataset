{"101487":98168,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible. As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I was extraordinarily disappointed with this utter disaster. I went in to it with low expectations but high hopes\\, having loved the latest film\\, Rogue One. Alas\\, my hopes were squashed and my low expectations were blown away by the absurdity that is The Last Jedi. I don't understand how the directors\\, producers\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and anyone with control over this film could possibly be a Star Wars fan\\, nor how they could have produced this without anyone understanding the basics of space.\\n\\nWhile this film has more problems than I can list\\, the worst of them are:\\n\\n1. The lack of a quality story. The entire plot is based on space having atmosphere and somehow needing fuel to maintain the same speed because physics don't apply\\, on all of these vastly different ships having the EXACT same top speed\\, starships running on fuel and not their own energy generators like practically all the other starships have been in Star Wars\\, not to mention taking all of the setups from the Force Awakens and throwing them in the trash. \\n\\n2. Rian Johnson ruined the main character of the original Star Wars saga. Luke\\, the hero that risked his own fate and that of the universe to save the second most evil person in the universe\\, Darth Vader\\, somehow decides to murder his goddamned nephew who is also his best friend's son and his student for years and years\\, in his sleep\\, all because he was having some dark side tendencies. How in the hell are these the same people? How in the hell could he have attempted and succeeded at saving Darth Vader\\, that evil cyborg who had slaughtered children and many\\, many innocents\\, yet when he discovers that his nephew and student has some bad thoughts\\, he decides to murder him?!? Oh yeah\\, and then\\, instead of dying in some epic battle\\, or going out with some sort of bang\\, he dies from over-exertion from some stupid never seen before force power.\\n\\n3. Politicizing Star Wars. I am all for diversity in media\\, as long as it isn't forced\\, and as long as it isn't prioritized over story or other important aspects. I love female or non-white protagonists\\, but when you see Kathleen Kennedy\\, the President of Disney's LucasFilm wear a shirt that says: \\\"The Force is Female\\\"\\, you start to ask questions. (For non-star wars fans\\, the force is not male or female\\, its not even an entity) Why do all of the male characters in this film have serious flaws? Why do all of the very few good ones have serious flaws that need a female to not only point them out\\, but demean them in doing so? Po is a hothead idiot who gets put in his place by Purple Haired Lady and Leia. Finn is not only a deserter\\, but a pretender and a clown\\, and he needs Rose to point it out. Why are the ONLY new or surviving white male characters evil and in power? Why are the original white male heroes shitty people all of a sudden? Han is a shitty dad who abandoned his family\\, Luke is a shitty master that tried to murder his student and nephew and then ran off to whine and bitch and die. I could go on and on. Diversity is great\\, but why not at least one good white male character?\\n\\n4. Snoke.\\n\\n5. Rey IS a mary sue. This has absolutely nothing to do with her gender. If she were a man\\, yet had the exact same attributes and story\\, HE would also be a mary sue. She not only has absolutely ZERO flaws\\, she somehow beats Kylo Ren\\, who is not only descended from Anakin Skywalker\\, one of the strongest force users ever known\\, but who also has trained under Luke\\, another very strong Jedi since a very young age\\, and then was trained in the dark side under the extremely powerful Snoke. She beats him with no training whatsoever. And then she also beats Luke\\, and then turns on a lightsaber and threatens him with it. And she uses the Mind Trick force power with no training\\, and raises a huge pile of many stones with no training\\, when Luke had to struggle to raise but one. She is also just good at fighting with anything from hand to hand\\, staff\\, and lightsaber\\, not to mention a super good mechanic\\, pilot\\, etc. Where is her progression? Where is her story ark? Where are her flaws?\\n\\n6. Kylo Ren. You replace Lord Vader\\, one of the most epic villains\\, with this whiny\\, skinny little bitch? You're kidding\\, right?\\n\\n7. General Hux... somehow\\, yet another young\\, whiny little bitch replaces another epic character that scared the socks off of anyone\\, Grand MotherMoffin Tarkin. Please. \\n\\n8. Last but far from least: Ruining every epic\\, serious moment with a type of stupid comedy that doesn't belong in Star Wars. Stupid cute animals that are somehow in almost every scene in the movie yet have absolutely no part in the story. \\n\\nAlright\\, this is getting way longer than I meant to type\\, I need to stop. I saw it twice\\, because I fell asleep 15 minutes into the first time. I really\\, really wanted to like it. I really\\, really tried to like it. Unfortunately\\, the only redeeming qualities were some awesome sound and visual effects. I am really good at finding the positive in everything\\, so much so\\, that I don't dislike a lot of things. That being said\\, this is not only the worst Star Wars film\\, it is the worst movie I have ever seen. Stay away from this horrible plague\\, stay far\\, far away.","true":true}
