Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't even mediocre.\\n\\nOkay\\, the effects was adequate but overall the movie was badly written as if the story itself doesn't seem to know where it is going.\\n\\nAnd the \\\"critics\\\" are obviously bought and sold to DIsney as most of them think this \\\"movie\\\" is a masterpiece?\\n\\nthis is without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie ever made.\\n\\nMy advice: Go back and never do movies again as without George Lucas holding Kathleen Kennedy's political agenda back Lucasfilm cannot make movies anymore.","true":true}
