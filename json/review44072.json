Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is eveyething wrong with Micheal Bay esq modern Hollywood blockbusters. No tact. No wit. No heart. Just flashy visuals and one dimensional writing \/ characters. It's the radio music of movies. And while that passes as \\\"entertainment\\,\\\" Star Wars was supposed to be smarter than that.","true":true}
