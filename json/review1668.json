Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it was very good. Beautifully shot\\, great acting\\, top notch visual affects\\, and a terrific soundtrack. The movie is \\\"enjoyable.\\\" \\n\\nThe reason for my low score is because I did not \\\"like\\\" the movie. As a fan of the original trilogy I actually feel slighted. No spoilers in this review\\, and do not take my review too close to heart. I have been dedicated fan since I saw the first movie\\, Episode IV\\, as a child. I've played nearly every game\\, read every book\\, all the comics\\, every show\\, and STILL have my full\\, original\\, Hasbro collection (minus the Princess in her wedding gown...never found that one).\\n\\nMy fanatic dedication is over now\\, and I will watch the next movie\\, once it releases to DVD. I have some Black series figures for sale\\, now\\, since I will no longer collect them.","true":true}
