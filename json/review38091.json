Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The storyline was OK\\, but a lot of the dialogue was cheesy and predictable. It was not a worthy successor to the first six Star Wars movies. Too bad.
