Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Congrats Disney\\, Rey's now officially the biggest \\\"Mary Sue\\\" in any galaxy\\, near\\,far\\,past\\, or present! \\n\\nThree plot holes\/examples of Rain Johnson's middle finger to fans:\\n-Leia Poppins\/Star Lord GOTG\\, I can survive in space ridiculousness\\n-Single-person operated (Mary Sue Jr.)\\, light-speed\\, Kamikaze but no First Order light speed to cut off the cash for clunkers rebel ship\\n-If Luke was going to give himself to the Force anyway\\, why project yourself instead of just going in person. Super dumb.\\n\\nI would list all the other plot holes but it would be a waste of time and this movie made me not care what happens next. Everything was so bad.","true":true}
