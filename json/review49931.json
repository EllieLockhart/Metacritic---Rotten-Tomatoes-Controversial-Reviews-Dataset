Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You have to see this movie twice before you can fully appreciate how amazing it is. Much better than Ep. 7\\, which was really just a rehash of Ep. 1 and Ep. 4. It defies expectations (which is probably why some people don\u2019t like it). I am a lifelong Star Wars fan (since 1977) and I love this addition to the franchise! ","true":true}
