Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die.  Kill it!\\\"  Well Disney\\, you've managed to do that.  You killed my entire past.  You killed everything I took from the Star Wars stories as a kid growing up in the 1980s; good vs evil\\, learning\\, hard work.  I won't launch into a tirade or give a bunch of spoilers but here are just a few of the questions I waited two years to have answered that weren't even mentioned in the new movie:\\n\\n1.  What happened to the Rebellion after Return\\, up to the time of Awakens?\\n2.  How did the First Order come to be?  How powerful are the?  How did they come to rule the galaxy\\, again\\, since Awakens?\\n3.  Who are Rey's parents?  (assuming the story in Last Jedi is a lie)\\n4.  How did Maz get Anakin\/Luke's saber?  How was it obtained after Empire?\\n5.  Why isn't the biggest Star Destroyer EVER faster?\\n\\nMost importantly\\, why do I care about any of the new characters after this movie?  What makes me want to go see the next one?","true":true}
