Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie adds a lot of inconsistencies to the story. Weird things happening as well like gravity in space and super woman Leia\\, the jokes were lazzy (but endurable) and there was a huge disregard for some characters specially mark hamil that was really not Luke personality. Theres some useless things that doesn't add anything to the story\\, and makes the movie much worse like casino ark\\, cow milking\\, the weird green habitats of the island\\, rey going for the dark hole and nothing happening... Also have to mention the excess of commercialization like bb8\\, black bb8\\, porgs...\\n\\nBut there was amazing scenes as well. The whole fighting was realy interesting in general. Very graphic\\, the sound was amazing. Poe scenes in overall amazing. Rey + Kylo light saber scene (one of the bests of the entire saga) and some interesting plot twists.\\n\\nIt had potential to be really good\\, one of the bests and become just one more random one. Not that is was bad: It just wasn't great\\, instead\\, was very disappointing.","true":true}
