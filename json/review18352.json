Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a very up and down movie. There were memorable scenes that I enjoyed and I felt the movie was entertaining\\, but fundamentally\\, Star Wars is about its characters\\, and Rian has killed off the most interesting ones. As much as I thought this was an ok movie\\, I'm left feeling not even the least bit excited about the next one.","true":true}
