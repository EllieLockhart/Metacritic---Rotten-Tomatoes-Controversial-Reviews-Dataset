Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest Star Wars installment is full of misguided slapstick that panders to family Christmas audiences who can't handle the depth of more complicated sci-fi dramas. There are several scenes that come off so cheesy they could be in the 1980s Bowie movie\\, Labyrinth. Within the Star Wars saga this felt both abrasive and cheap.  This is a Star Wars for a dumber audience.","true":true}
