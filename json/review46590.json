Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WATCH THIS MOVIE MORE THAN ONCE!! Guys\\, I hated this movie as much\\, if not more than\\, as you the first time I saw it in theaters opening\\, 1 am in the morning. HUGE SW fan\\, and I loved TFA and especially Rogue One. Watch. This. Movie. Again. It\u2019s far from my favorite in the series\\, but it holds up just fine and I really think it will get better with age. Don\u2019t let the recoil from the shocking spit on every theory we theorized on for over a year ruin this movie for you. It\u2019s different\\, it\u2019s fresh\\, there are genuine SW moments. My rating may get better over time\\, may get worse. But see this movie a second time!","true":true}
