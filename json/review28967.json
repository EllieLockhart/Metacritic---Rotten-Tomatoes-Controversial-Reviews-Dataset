Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed as a long time fan\\, don't understand a lot of the hate to be honest. I forget who said it\\, but I agree with the statement that most people were disappointed because of the movie not explaining or confirming some of their wild fan theories that they themselves came up with and thought were important.","true":true}
