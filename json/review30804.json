Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Smoke was a deception. I didn\u2019t like his outfit. Kylo Rem doesn\u2019t have the power to take the lead of the dark side. He is an spoiled child. From episode 7 and 8 There isn\u2019t a sustancial difference with Ray. I didn\u2019t like Leia flying in the space. Luke\\, Luke\\, Luke I wanted from episode 7 to 8 to see a Master Jedi. He isn\u2019t Yoda but the best Jedi fights are from episode 3. I hope J J Abraham can rescue the franchise. ","true":true}
