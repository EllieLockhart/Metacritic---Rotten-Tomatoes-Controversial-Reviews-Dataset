Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After sort of enjoying the force awakens I had high hopes for the last jedi but unfortunatley left very dissapointed \\, without giving anything away the film just seemed to drag and at one point felt like leaving the cinema \\, Finn's scenes with Rose didnt work for me there was no chemistry between them and there story in the movie just felt pointless \\, Kylo Ren also doesn't convince me as a Baddy when you think of Vader \\, The Emperor ... even Darth Maul was a really good baddy . The whole movie just felt rushed and left you with too many unanswered questions \\, There's not one scene in the whole movie that stands at me !!! Disney clearly just looking to churn out these movies !!!!","true":true}
