Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The opening scene with the bombers that need to be on top of the enemy ships in order to throw their bombs was when I realized the movie was going to suck. I don't expect a Star Wars movie to be accurate with physics but come on. These bombers seemed more like WW II planes than spaceships. There are so man plotholes and subplots that go nowhere. If the movie was to be cut to the \\\"relevant\\\" scenes it would probably be around 30min long. There was also nothing original about The Last Jedi. The picture of Frankenstein's monster comes to mind. Something that has been constructed out of parts\\, salvaged from things which should have stayed undisturbed and dead. For example the scene where Rey is in the boring version of the Dagobah cave\\, or the planet that is definitely not Hoth because it's salt (thank god that soldier told us). I cannot understand how anyone enjoyed this movie. At least we got to know who Supreme Leader Snook was. A nobody and it doesn't matter anyway. There is no background story. He was just the new 2 dimensional Emperor\\, because obviously a Star Wars movie needs this... All in all it was a huge disappointment and I don't plan on watching Episode 9.","true":true}
