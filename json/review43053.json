Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was visually stunning\\, and had many good actors\\, and is a decent sci-fi flick. However\\, as a star war movie\\, the plot was an abomination full of contradictions\\, plot convenience\\, plot armor\\, and lack of common sense. It felt as if the creators had never watch any star wars movies before it\\, and almost every single plot decision the writers made\\, left me scratching my head.","true":true}
