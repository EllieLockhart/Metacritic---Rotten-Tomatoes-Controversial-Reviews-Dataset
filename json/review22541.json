Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's get one thing perfectly clear here: this was going to be an uphill battle from the moment the Sequel Trilogy was announced. Following the disappointing \\\"Force Awakens\\\"\\, and the maverick surprise which was \\\"Rogue One\\\"\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is forced to be both a homage to the styles of Empire due to the stubborn refusal of its directors and crew to fully abandon the franchise's past triumphs and fully devote themselves to advancing into new territory. The acting\\, cinematography\\, and effects were fine and up to a par beyond the outcome of the film\\, but everything here feels unworldly to the true emphasis of what Star Wars was and is still about. It's time that the franchise stops trying to base their future on the successes of it's past\\, and break the new ground in a scope and manner which the Original Trilogy did.","true":true}
