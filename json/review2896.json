Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Why was it that the first thing that Luke did was to get changed into hermit clothes?\\n\\nLeia re-animating and then flying through space was ridiculous.\\n\\nSnoke was wasted.\\n\\nThis awful film seems like an excuse to 'reset' the Star Wars universe\\, but it was not done well at all!","true":true}
