Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie works very well as a Disney princess movie\\, but not an actual Star Wars movie.  All of George Lucas fears of Disney buying his company has been realized with this movie.\\n\\nSeveral characters do not act like their actual chatacters from the other movies.  There's a reason people keep saying #notmyluke.  Plot points have been thrown in seemingly to confuse the audience only.  If you watched Episode 7\\, and pondered the many questions it raises\\, including Reys Parents\\, who Snoke actually is\\, what luke will say or do: go ahead and toss those aside and forget they ever existed.  For this movie will so exactly the same.\\n\\nIn short: though well written for an average stand alone flick\\, it does not work at all as a Star Wars movie.  If this is the direction Walt's company goes with for their newly purchased universe they will soon kill it.","true":true}
