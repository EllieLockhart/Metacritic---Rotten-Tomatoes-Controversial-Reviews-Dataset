{"101487":139576,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the first Star Wars movie in 1977 when it was released in theatres. I was 10 at the time. I was hooked from the moment that the star destroyer flew overhead and have been a lifelong fan since. In particular\\, a Luke Skywalker fan. My only disappointment with the original trilogy was that we never saw Luke fulfill his full potential as a Jedi. In fact\\, he would have been killed by the emperor if not for the intervention of his father (another favorite of mine\\, Darth Vader). However\\, I had a number of novels that presented Luke's post Return of the Jedi (ROTJ) life. This included his progression to Grand Master Jedi with incredible force powers\\, falling in love\\, getting married\\, having a son\\, and losing the love of his life. It was a life full of triumph and tragedy. It gave me what I wanted\\, a full rich history with Luke fulfilling his full potential. Yet\\, that post ROTJ history is no more according to the Mouse. \\n\\nHowever\\, I accepted this development since the Mouse promised us a new trilogy continuing the Skywalker story. I was hopeful that I would again see Luke achieve his full potential. Then the first move came out and... I enjoyed it. I was sad when Han died\\, and disappointed with Luke's minuscule role. Yet\\, I was hopeful and excited for what was to come with The Last Jedi. I wanted to know more about Snoke and who Rey's parents were. But\\, most of all\\, I wanted to see Luke's story. \\n\\nWhich brings me to today.. I saw The Last Jedi yesterday with a friend. I then went on this site to see what other viewers were saying. A divisive lot we are. Before I give you my impressions of the movie\\, let me say this. If you liked the movie\\, I am happy for you\\, go see it again and enjoy it. But please do not denigrate those who did not enjoy it. Let them have their opinion. The same goes for those who did not enjoy the movie. \\n\\nMy friend enjoyed the movie. I am happy for here. As for me\\, I did not. The thing is\\, I really\\, really wanted to love this movie. Even as I watched the movie and grew slightly bored at times\\, such as the Finn storyline\\, I really wanted to love this movie. Even when the most interesting character in the first part of the movie\\, the seemingly all-powerful\\, all-seeing\\, mysterious Snoke was killed in a frankly ridiculous manner (you are all-seeing\\, but can't see or feel the movement of a lightsabre inches from you?)\\, I wanted to love this movie. Yet\\, with only minutes left in this movie\\, I did not. Up until this point\\, the movie presented me with a Luke that was not the Luke that I knew from the original trilogy. The Luke that I knew would never\\, even for a second abandon his family or the good fight (and certainly would not \\, even for a second\\, think of killing his nephew in his sleep for something that he had not even done).  I was given a Luke who was the antithesis of the Luke that progressed in the now no longer in canon novels. This was a Luke who was a coward and a failure. This was a Luke who achieved nothing after ROTJ. This was a Luke that abandoned his family. \\n\\nBut\\, with minutes left\\, there he was walking into the base just as all hope seemed lost. I though to myself\\, this is where it all comes together\\, this is where Luke saves the day and shows us his full potential. In a way\\, he did save the day and again lit the spark that I am sure will lead to the good guys winning the fight in episode IX. But\\, I am still left sad and disappointed with this movie. Luke's victory was just an illusion\\, he was never really there. Worst of all\\, he is dead. Sure\\, he might come back as a force ghost in episode IX\\, but this does not change the fact that in life\\, his story after ROTJ was sad and solitary. \\n\\nAgain\\, there is no right or wrong in how you feel about this movie. If you enjoyed this movie\\, go see it again\\, enjoy it some more. I am glad for you. I just wish that I was one of you. Without Luke\\, there is no more Star Wars for me. \\n\\n.... Yet\\, there is always hope. There is a way that the Mouse could rectify its poor treatment of Luke.. Give us a Luke Skywalker movie. A movie that shows us a post ROTJ adventure of a young Luke. A movie that shows us that Luke's life after ROTJ was not all bad\\, that he did accomplish more good. And\\, most of all\\, a movie that shows a Luke kicking a** again and again. There is an actor out there\\, Sebastian Stan (Marvel's Winter Soldier)\\, who would make an excellent young Luke. It probably won't happen\\, but again\\, there is always hope.","true":true}
