Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, its not Empire\\, but expecting it to be Empire was extremely foolish\\, this had way too much hype to live up to. It was a good movie\\, and while parts of it end up being unnecessary\\, it still holds up well. So many people are saying things like \\\"worst star wars movie everrrrrr\\\" well clearly they did not watch the prequels\\, nor did they even watch Return of the Jedi. Porgs are not as bad as ewoks\\, and none of the somewhat silly scenes compare in any way to the menace that was jar jar. I have to back up the critics on this one\\, which is something that I normally would not do.","true":true}
