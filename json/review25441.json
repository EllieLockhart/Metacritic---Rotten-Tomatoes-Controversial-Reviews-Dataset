Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nope.\\n\\nJust nope\\, there are a lot of things to like about this movie visually\\, and is very exploitative on new things to introduce into Star Wars lorre\\, that make this a joyful experience\\, and a wonderful film\\, but it unfortunately falls flat the rest of the film\\, and as a Star Wars film.\\n\\nRian Johnson of the plot hole filled Looper\\, does an amazing job at eliminating plot holes we spent decades asking\\, and an additional two years on top of that. Not solving plot holes\\, eliminating them. Only to create a handful of his own to not be answered.\\n\\nI was excited about the possibility of Rian Johnson being at the helm of a Skywalkerless Trilogy\\, but he went ahead and created that within the Skywalker Saga already. Needless to say\\, I am not looking forward to him at the helm of a new trilogy anymore.","true":true}
