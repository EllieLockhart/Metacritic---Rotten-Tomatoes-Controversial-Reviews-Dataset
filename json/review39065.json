Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This abomination is a film riddled with plot holes and nonsensical actions (yes\\, even within the bounds of a fantasy). In vain desperation to defy expectation\\, Rian Johnson has essential characters act in inexplicable ways\\, as if they are suffering from a variety of psychoses. This is a hollow\\, sterile shell devoid of magic where style and theme are used as bludgeons against substance. With full awareness of the cringe-inducing flaws of the prequels\\, I say that this film is an embarrassment to the franchise.","true":true}
