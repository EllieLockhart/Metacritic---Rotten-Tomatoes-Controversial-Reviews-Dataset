Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A shoddy mess of film that I can't believe got made.  The plot is incomprehensible and the character development is inconsistent and often disappointing.\\n\\nIf this were just any other movie\\, it would be a forgettable shrug of a film.  As a Star Wars film?  This is unforgivable.","true":true}
