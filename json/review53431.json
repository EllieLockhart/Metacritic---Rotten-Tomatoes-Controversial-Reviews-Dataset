Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has officially killed Star Wars mythos. \\n\\nReasons for dislike:\\nCharacter deconstruction\/destroying alterings\\, along with lore and established lore being retconnned.\\nDestroying all the achievements of the original trilogy.\\nCompletely neglecting and ignoring character progressions of the past.\\nLuke Skywalker character utterly disgraced and deconstructed\\, as if Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi never happened.\\nLuke giving up? Did the people behind TLJ never see the original trilogy?! Luke saw a sliver of good in his father\\, Darth Vader\\, and on that little hunch set out to turn him to the good side\\, facing the Emperor and death itself\\, he also knowly it could be a trap\\, set out to save his friends in Empire Strikes back. He doesn't give up\\, the Jedi doesn't give up\\, a set back maybe\\, but never completely give up.\\nLuke dies the most retarded possibly way.\\nForce ghosts can now interact with the physical realm\\, with lightning no less?!\\n\\nThe movie made no freaking sense\\, from the very start\\, several plot holes all over the place\\, and certain arcs that could have been cut off completely\\, Rose utterly useless crap.\\n\\nWhy no Finn and Poe adventure? They had great chemistry\\, their few parts in episode 7 in the beginning were great\\, they could easily have been the ones going off to find something of use.\\n\\nRey backstory completely thrown in trash.\\nSnoke backstory nonexistent\\, character erased.\\nRey and Kylo possible side switch ruined.\\n\\nThis movie is hopeless\\, not going to waste money on Star Wars until Disney get their act together and stop their political agenda pushing nonsense\\, which has no place in movies\\, politics always ruin movies\\, keep to ethical questions and great questions of morale instead of this horseturd.","true":true}
