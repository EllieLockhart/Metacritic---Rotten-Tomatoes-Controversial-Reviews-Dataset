Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Since dead presidents have come in to vote on June 13th\\,  I figured I should revisit my review.  I'll make it a 2*\\, though i'd really give it less than zero.  Not scoring ratings under 2 stars really doesn't give a true read of the score.  So\\, really how can we trust it?   OK\\, still half because the actors did their best with what they were given.  Much in the way of stunning visuals\\, but WTF were Disney\\, Kennedy\\, and Johnson thinking.  If I hadn't promised to keep an eye on someone (health issue) I was contemplating walking out and getting my money back during the casino scene.\\nThree quarters of the way through I was beginning to wonder when it was going to end.  It may be the longest episode time-wise but only by minutes\\, but enduring it seemed like hours.  I can say Lucas knew how to keep the pacing so you rode on the edge of the movie to the end and the time passed before you knew it.  \\nNot since the O.J. Bronco chase have I ever been similarly entertained.  The strategies couldn't have been more inept.  For a plan to wipe them all out in a practically slow motion chase through space when you have hyperdrive was uninspiring to say the least.  Tarkin would have just had ships jump ahead to cut off escape routes\\, but he went down with original ideas. \\nI also have to agree with Mr. Hamill\\, I fundamentally disagree with everything that was decided for the Luke Skywalker character as well.  That being said\\, I have the utmost respect for Mark Hamill for his professionalism and his performance with what he was given.  He has invested a good part of himself into the character and gave it the respect that obviously the production team didn't.\\nI would have given The Last Jedi\\, a Not Interested\\, if it hadn't been for some of the visuals\\, and the acting of Mr. Hamill.   \\n\\nAt this point\\, I have no desire for episode 9\\, and quite unfortunate\\, that is.  And as an edit\\, with Lucasfilm personal's attacks on the fans since\\, that is why I haven't seen Solo and not rated it.  It looks like I will not be seeing anything Disney in the foreseeable future at this point either.","true":true}
