Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never cared enough about a movie to sign up for a Rotten Tomatoes account to leave a review but in this case I felt obligated. Episode 7 left the door open for so many possibilities to creatively intertwine the whole series and Rian Johnson decided to shut them all down. It is almost as if he set out to undo all of JJ Abrams plot lines just to create his own standalone movie. The main cliffhanger questions after Episode 7 that left fans wondering for years were \\\"Who is Supreme Leader Snoke?\\\" and \\\"Who are Rey's parents?\\\". Rian Johnson must have been fed up with reading two years of creative fan theories so he decided to answer both with the least satisfying end result possible.\\n\\nIt seems his goal for this movie was to really make the story his own. He glosses over so many things it almost makes me grateful for George Lucas's attempt in the prequels to explore the force in more detail with \\\"mitichlorians\\\". This was a very unsatisfying movie with a lot of flashy actions scenes and an obnoxious amount of cute creatures being shoved in our faces in order to sell more Disney Star Wars merchandise at Walmart. \\n\\nThe same director should have been chosen for all 3 films of this trilogy in order to tell the most satisfying story. I'm not sure Rian Johnson left JJ Abrams with enough to put the pieces back together to salvage Episode 9. Very disappointing.","true":true}
