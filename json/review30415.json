Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously.  Can we just wipe this one from the archives and can we all petition to have JJ or Lucas remake episode 8 for all the true SW faithfuls?Because it's more important to keep the SW faithfuls engaged vs trying to move on without us. --I was 8 when I first saw (episode 5) ESB and ever since that movie I have loved every one\\, and enjoyed playing every SW game made.  I even enjoyed the prequels 1-3 and then then finally when made I enjoyed TFA. Mostly for its ability to give us new characters(both good and evil)  and another good story.  \\nBut now all of sudden the evil character i feared most \\nhas been killed off already. And now I'm left to only fear Kylo.. Really??  I'm not as interested now.  Can't write anymore since tired.  But seriously we need someone to save this trilogy.  Need more chewy and duals...  Allow your audience to enjoy the characters again.","true":true}
