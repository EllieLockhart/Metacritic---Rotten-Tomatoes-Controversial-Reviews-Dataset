Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First it was visually stunning. But this is something you can just hope for watching a million dollar franchise produced by Disney. On the other hand storywise the characters felt hollow and the script felt rushed. The emotional connection you developed in the first movie got thrown out of the window and things have been invented that could have been done easier with more emotional connectedness. Many scene were so random and not essential for the plot that you just could have cut half of the film and it would make sense. \\\"Casino Planet\\\"... and the flight of Leia. I mean yeah\\, Stunning looking and all but whyy... Okay. Whatever. All in all it was okay but I guess it is just liked because it has STAR WARS written on it. But it makes the franchise feel very hollow. As hollow as most of the Marvel Movies are.","true":true}
