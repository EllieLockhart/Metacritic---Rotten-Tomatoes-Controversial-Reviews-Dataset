Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi.... about 70 minutes of a good Star Wars movie. 83 minutes of sloppy crapola. The main plots I really enjoyed\\, visuals were stunning ( minus all the extra goofy cgi). Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill and John Boyega all turn in outstanding performances. The others..... ehhh drag the film down a lot. Poe\u2019s character truly grates on my nerves. With some serious editing and a retooling of a few scenes it could\/should have been excellent. However\\, some of those misfires really submarine this installment. 5\/10","true":true}
