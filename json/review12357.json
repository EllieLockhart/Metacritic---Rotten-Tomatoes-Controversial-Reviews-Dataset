Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am very split about this movie. When I first watched it I really did not like it\\, and upon rewatching it I could better appreciate what it tried to do\\, but in my opinion it ultimately failed at what it set out to achieve. I still respect what was attempted\\, but I probably will not be revisiting this movie again.","true":true}
