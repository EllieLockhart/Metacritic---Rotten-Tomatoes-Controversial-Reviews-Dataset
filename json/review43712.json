Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the biggest disappointment. I\u2019m a big Star Wars fan and this movie was an abomination. It was not entertaining\\, the characters were weak\\, the humor was awful. If you love Star Wars\\, just skip this movie. Disney- please fire the director. I refuse to watch any more movies he directs. ","true":true}
