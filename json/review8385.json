Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt the need to create a RT account to rate this\\, that's how bad this film hurt my sole. Endless plot holes\\, threw 30 years of story development out the window\\, and tarnished the Skywalker legacy.\\n\\nMay God have mercy on your sole\\, Disney.","true":true}
