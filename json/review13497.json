Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel a disturbance in the force\\, and it's this movie.   The only light saber fight is against .  One really good fight scene would have at least somewhat saved the movie.  Instead\\, we have Kylo and Rey\\, fighting faceless guards\\, and  neither of them use any of their telekinesis powers. \\n This saber fight was the worst innovative one ever.  And they have the stupid tug of war over a the light saber..   This is is not the type of war that is implied in the title Star Wars!!!  There's nothing epic about this.  Too much angst and brooding\\, and not enough real action.","true":true}
