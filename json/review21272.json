{"101487":147268,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie expecting great things\\, and instead walked out confused and disappointed.  This movie\\, technically speaking\\, is among the best.  However\\, movies should never live and die by their technical wizardry as most competent and level-headed consumers of media would agree.  Instead\\, they should be judged by the quality of its story and performances.  Star Wars is a unique franchise because we've lived and grown up with these characters for so long; they do not come from literature\\, and we really only interpret them based upon the onscreen portrayals (whereas with a series such as Lord of the Rings\\, both books and the movies).  What I was incredibly disappointed about with this movie was the handling of Luke Skywalker as a character.  I found the change from Return of the Jedi to this portrayal to go far beyond what Luke would actually act like as he aged.  There were no bona fide lightsaber battles as we know them\\, and Luke dies a very anti-climactic death.  Plus\\, when he meets with Leia\\, he is really only meeting her via astral projection\\, so when it is revealed he's really on Ach-To\\, the whole thing in hindsight seems incredibly manipulative on Luke's end to do such a thing to Leia.  Personally\\, I am glad Captain Phasma got killed off\\, because she was never more than a merchandising ploy (hence the 'cool' armor\\, despite the character being of little importance to the story).  But Snoke getting killed off without explanation as to how he came to be Supreme Leader in the first place was just really wrong.  I like surprises and twists\\, but I still expect a proper lightsaber battle and I expected Luke to return for Episode IX.  All in all\\, this has just been a mammoth mistake\\, because Rey\\, Finn\\, and Kylo will simply never be as interesting as the Skywalkers as lead draws.  They're too ordinary\\, and it suspends the bubble of belief about being transported to a galaxy far\\, far\\, away.  I'm also a Chemical Engineer and quite bright\\, and I arrived at this opinion on my own before looking at other people's views (I am an independent thinker).  The prequels\\, while not without their faults\\, took surprises in relative continuity within the established Star Wars universe.  To me\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi feels like heresy.  As such\\, I give it a major thumbs-down.  Do not reward Disney with extra ticket sales; skip the movie!","true":true}
