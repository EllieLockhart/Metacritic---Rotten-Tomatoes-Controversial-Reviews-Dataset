Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't looking forward to watching this film\\, thinking that it would be too Disneyfied. Yes there are Disney imprints on it\\, but they are superbly interwoven into  an original Damtar Wars film.\\n2.5 hours but loved every minute of it\\, especially the intelligent end.\\nHighly recommend!","true":true}
