Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couldn't honestly give this a great rating as for some reason Disney and producers\/director has taken no notice of what Starwars was about. Killed off with absolutely no explanation pretty much all the Main characters and left serious plot holes thru out. Action was real good and acting also great but Lukes final story was clearly shelved at an early stage and a very poor version written just to fill 20minutes. With over 600 million made already am sure Disney don't really care about killing off greatest Story in History. Maybe we can live in hope that JJ with redeem this  debacle a bring back some sanity and a great ending to the Original Story","true":true}
