Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What happened to the great setup from The Force Awakens??!!  The Last Jedi threw away all those great setups!  Who is Snoke?\\, Rey's Parents?\\, Rey and Finn as a couple?\\, Capt Phasma?.  Kylo Ren turning to the dark side?  No answers to the great mysteries setup in TFA!!  In TLJ Luke Skywalker was not the Luke Skywalker we've all come to know and love.  Luke was my favorite character in Star Wars\\, and now this mess of a movie has tarnished his legacy!  Rian Johnson is a complete buffoon for dismissing  JJ Abrams story in TFA.  Getting back to Rey and Finn - They were apart 99% in TLJ...WHY??  They had great chemistry in TFA and played off each other well.  General Hux\\, Snoke\\, and Kylo Ren are \\\"The Three Stooges\\\" of outer space.  All became laughable idiots in TLJ.  How can anyone take The First Order seriously going forward??   The Empire Strikes Back is an A+ Star Wars movie.  The Empire Strikes Back is actually a great movie PERIOD!   The Last Jedi pales in comparison.  TLJ pales in comparison to the Prequels and the Star Wars Holiday Special.  Good thing that JJ is coming back in Episode IX.  Please JJ Abrams fix this mess that Rian Johnson (and Disney) has created!!!!!   Yours Truly\\, Star Wars Lover","true":true}
