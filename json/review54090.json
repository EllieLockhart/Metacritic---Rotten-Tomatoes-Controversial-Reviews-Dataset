Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't even know where to start\\, I was looking forward to this film\\, hoping it would be a worthy addition to the star wars franchise but Im afraid it could be the worst. They shit all over Luke Skywalker and his legacy just like they did to Han in the first movie(making him a deadbeat dad\/husband who can't keep track of the millennium falcon) The humour felt forced and uncharacteristic for star wars. Luke looks like a drunk who left a map to be found but didn't want to be found? Your telling me he has cut himself off from the force and wants nothing to do with it but then at the end of the movie decides he wants to be one with the force? Luke and Yoda burning ancient jedi scripts!? 5 minutes of training for Rey !? I haven't even scratched the surface yet. This is the most disappointing movie I can remember seeing for a LONG time.They had so much potential to work with and I don't know how they could have shit on their fans anymore.
