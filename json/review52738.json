Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All youre gonna see is half star ratings or five star ratings if you browse these user reviews. Bunch of praise for being a new star wars movie. Bunch of butthurt for it being a new star wars movie. This movie has all-around remarkable acting for a star wars movie. It also has some of the most visually captivating scenes. I wish they would stop taking source material from the OT to duplicate scenes and start using it as reference to types of species to include in the ST. Like\\, how come there were no referemces to hutts or any of the species seen on Tatooine during the casino scene? would have been perfect reference material\\, but instead it was all new species wed never seen. A lot of fanservice\\, so the positives far outweigh the minor negatives. Rest of yall need to chill and just enjoy the new material.","true":true}
