Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved The Last Jedi!  It had everything I would want in a Star Wars film and I'm sad to see all of the negative reactions from the audience on RT.  This was a delightful film from beginning to end and I'm looking forward to the next chapter.","true":true}
