Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was an abomination to everything that makes star wars great. Rei is a worse Mary Sue than even Westly Crusher. Luke was basically ripped to shreads by the writers\\, purple haired general was stupid. They just threw away Snoke. and how they just trashed Admiral Akbar was disgraceful. I could go on and on about how bad this movie was but I think I've said enough","true":true}
