Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of great parts but... alas... it also feels like the more recent cartoons. Hey let's do some cool stuff. Plot holes? Sure\\, why not. Unbelievable scenes? Sure\\, why not. The underlying classical hero ethos of previous Star Wars movies has been poisoned as well. Now feelings are king and we must have easily identifiable bad guys so we can feel good about trashing their stuff. Very sad. Only arms dealers could have enough money to spend a night at a casino. Right. And the poor animals need us to... oh well. Old Star Wars it is not but there were a lot of great scenes.","true":true}
