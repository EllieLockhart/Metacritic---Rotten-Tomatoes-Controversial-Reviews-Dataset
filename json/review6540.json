Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does it have a few flaws? Yes - much less than The Force Awakens. \\n Those flaws do not take away from the overall story\/narrative. Took risks where Force Awakens did not.  Bold where Force Awakens was not.  Not predictable.  Not the norm.  Rian Johnson did not chose to play it safe and that's just what the Star Wars-universe needed.  Loved it.","true":true}
