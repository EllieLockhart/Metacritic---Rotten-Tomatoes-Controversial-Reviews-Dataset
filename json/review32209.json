Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars aside\\, this was just a bad movie. It felt so contrived and Disnified. There were too many long unnecessary story arcs and others that were totally underdeveloped. The writing was sloppy\\, confusing\\, and several times broke canon. And every single redeeming moment was awkwardly punctuated by cringe worthy humor that made me bury my face in my hands. I felt like I was watching a bad marvel movie. I will not be watching any further star wars films and I am astonished that this mess was given such a high rating by critics when it's not even a good movie\\, let alone a good star wars. It was like watching a parody of a star wars film. Blech\\, it's going to take a while to rinse the bad taste from my mouth.","true":true}
