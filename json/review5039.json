Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Crawls up from 0\\,5 stars due to the fantastic visuals\\, plus parts of it are really enjoyable like the fight in Snokes throne room. \\n\\nWould be even more enjoyable as a whole if it wasn't for the fact that they are pissing on what is Star Wars and Luke in particular. Not honoring the established lore\\, force users have now powers that we've never been near to see before. New characters that add nothing\\, killing off well known and beloved ones off screen. Etc\\, etc... Really disappointed with this one.","true":true}
