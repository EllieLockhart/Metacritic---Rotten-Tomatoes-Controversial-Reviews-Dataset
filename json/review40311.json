Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best Star Wars movies. It may take a second viewing or more time but it is fantastic. Incredible visuals\\, characters that are fleshed out with more nuance than in previous films. Last Jedi makes you doubt hope but in its final minutes brings us back to a child like sense of wonder and longing to be part of the adventure in a galaxy far far away.","true":true}
