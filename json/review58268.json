Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage! Forced humor\\, lazy plot\\, and Rian Johnson shitting all over the Star Wars legacy and what George Lucas created. He literally took everyone's favorite childhood characters and destroyed them. I hope that the fan backlash is epic. Those giving this piece of shit movie a five star rating don't understand Star Wars or the characters that were developed from episodes 1-6. This is the Skywalker saga. Yet Risn Johnson takes it\\, shits all over it\\, and feels the need to re-invent it for the sake of re-inventing. News flash dickhead...IT DOESN'T NEED RE-INVENTING OR AN INJECTION OF YOUR BULL SHIT HUMOR. You literally just destroyed the Star Wars legacy. There is now zero interest for episode IX\\, just because you wanted to hit the reset button. Completely shit on the past and what made these characters loveable and great\\, and gave us new watered down versions. Complete failure.","true":true}
