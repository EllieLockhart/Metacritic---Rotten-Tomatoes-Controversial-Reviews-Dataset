{"101487":105980,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A star for the music\\, effects and cinematography (but if you throw enough money at it\\, it's an expected outcome). No star for poorly written characters new and old. No star for huge plot holes throughout. *SPOILER* a one-dimensional space chase - 3 slightly faster ships vs a galaxy controlling empire - seriously I thought better of Rian Johnson (Looper was an okay time travel movie and just shows how lazy he's been with this one). No star for the pacing and humour that just doesn't work\\, it's not smart and a lot of it's out of character for the tone of scenes it's in. No star for this marvel-like money-making machine\\, where's my refund? This is not a finished or competent movie. EA\/Disney destroyed Battlefront and now RJ\/Disney have killed Star Wars.
