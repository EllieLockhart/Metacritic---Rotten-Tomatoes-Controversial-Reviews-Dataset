Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seemed like the purpose of this movie was to do away with what was built upon in previous movies in order to make some bland by the numbers movie. Some of the scenes didn't even make sense in terms of some of the characters motivations. Half of the movie was more or less wasted on a side quest that went nowhere. At the end of the movie\\, I didn't feel any kind of excitement for what comes next and didn't even bother seeing the movies that came after this one.","true":true}
