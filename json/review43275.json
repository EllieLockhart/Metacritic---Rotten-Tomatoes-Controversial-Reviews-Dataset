Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disappointing movie\\, in my opinion.  It does not follow a traditional Star Wars movie concept and tried to do too much.  Why have all the drama of Rey's parents in Episode 7 and answer in such a dull manner?  What was the point of Finn and Rose in this movie?  Why were Luke and Yoda so bizarre?  All I could see of this movie was the hope of selling Star Wars merchandise and setting up Episode 9.  I always see Star Wars movies at least twice in the theater\\, but I will not see this one more than once.","true":true}
