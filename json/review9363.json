Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets one star for visuals. God this movie is bad. If you know anything about film making or Star Wars lore you will hate this movie. If not you will think it is the greatest thing you have ever seen. At least the Phantom menace\\, Clones\\, and RotS were enjoyable.","true":true}
