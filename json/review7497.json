Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ever since George Lucas's stories were thrown out and he wasn't going to be a creative consultant\\, I knew things weren't going well. I had a bad feeling when I heard Disney bought Lucasfilm and that feeling was right. So far\\, the only good film Disney has made since having Star Wars is Rogue One\\, and that's an anthology film. I'll stick with the six films George Lucas was involved with\\, as it's his story and he had a vision and got people together to help his vision be realized. Whether you enjoy the prequels or not\\, you can't deny the story is interesting and good. These new films\\, particularly the Episodes\\, just rely on nostalgia and don't care about story or character development. But instead\\, just reboot the original trilogy and call it Episodes VII-IX\\, while also ruin the original characters story arcs and make them losers. Yeah\\, great work there Disney and Lucasfilm.?","true":true}
