Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am writing my first review here hoping to help ensure that rian johnson never makes another film. As an accepting fan of sci fi\\, i generally take what i can get. Sliders? Sure. Roddenberry's andromeda? Ok. Enterprise? Fine. Starship troopers 3? Why not. As a trek fan i have overlooked stupidity and laziness baked into too many scripts. I have gladly forgiven missteps in such films as cowboys vs aliens and found ways to enjoy them. I want to ignore flaws. I do not expect perfection. I can find no part of star wars: the last jedi that does not offend me. I believe it to be the most abject failure yet to stain science fiction filmdom. It must be seen to be believed. Watch it. Judge it. And then join me in the fight to stop the monster rian johnson. He cannot be allowed to further diminish sci fi. Thank you for reading.","true":true}
