Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BORING! I can still remember the awe and amazement I felt the first time I saw Star Wars in 1977 at a small-town theater in rural Oregon. This movie has none of the joy that made the first movie so enjoyable\\, nor does it come remotely close to achieving the heights of The Force Awakens. A profound disappintment that you would be well-served to avoid. It is overly long and I found myself hoping that bad things would happen to the main characters in the hope it would bring the movie to an end. ","true":true}
