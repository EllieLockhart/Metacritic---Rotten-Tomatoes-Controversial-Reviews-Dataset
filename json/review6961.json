Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the worst Star Wars movies ever. Doesn't just copy plot points\\, copies entire iconic scenes from V and VI. Tries too hard to be funny and so\\, so many ex machina moments that just didn't make sense. And WOW. The space \\\"physics\\\" were immersion-breakingly horrible.","true":true}
