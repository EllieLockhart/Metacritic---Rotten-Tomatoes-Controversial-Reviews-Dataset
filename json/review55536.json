Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice rollercoaster movie\\, but terrible Star Wars movie. It attempts to be fresh by going against expectations\\, but just trashes the Star Wars mythology.  A good writer\/director could make it fresh and new within the confines of the Star Wars story.  Thus\\, it reveals an incredible lack of creativity and imagination\\, relying on tricks of the trade to shock and entertain. The character of Luke was already well developed in the first three movies.  They just ignored that character development.   Luke would never sneak into a student's bedroom while he is sleeping\\, and would not consider killing a student because he suspects him being under the influence of a Sith Lord.  If he failed at something and went into retreat\\, it would be to revitalize himself\\, and come back stronger and more positive.  Rey's character has not been developed - we don't know anything about her\\, why she has these gifts and abilities without any training.  No story development for her character despite all the screen time in two movies.  Others have gone in depth on other story problems.  Basically this was a trashing of a great myth.","true":true}
