Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would recommend seeing this especially if you are a starwars fan but i compared this to the other movies and i did not think it stood up to them its a very clunckly story line and also all theorists will be sad","true":true}
