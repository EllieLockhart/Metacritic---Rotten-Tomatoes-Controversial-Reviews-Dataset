Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shocked to see the negative feedback\\, since I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I will say that this was the only film since Empire that truly surprised me\\, and that should be a good thing. ","true":true}
