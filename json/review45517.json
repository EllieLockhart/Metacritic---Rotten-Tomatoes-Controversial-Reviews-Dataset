Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very Disappointed.  Totally ruined characters\\, left very little to build on.  More like prequels than Original Trilogy. \\n Action packed\\, but Long with many useless scenes.  Hopefully JJ Abrams can save the franchise In Episode 9.  Can't believe they are giving this guy a trilogy.","true":true}
