Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I appreciate the movie in its ability to ascend beyond certain Star Wars tropes that we have come to expect\\, which certainly distinguishes itself from the rest of the saga.  The unfortunate part is that this isn't what the new trilogy needed.  Should this have been the beginning of the trilogy the tone would've been fantastic\\, but taking everything set up in Episode 7 and basically knocking it to the side is a bit much for a middle of the trilogy movie.  There are certain scenes in this movie that just don't belong or feel really out of place.  Looking at this movie as a standalone is fine\\, but I cannot get on board with it being the middle of the trilogy.","true":true}
