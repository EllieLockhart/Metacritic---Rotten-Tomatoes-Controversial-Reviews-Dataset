Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes the Star Wars universe in a completely different and rich direction. It tests the very ideology of the franchise and is filled with intricate and undeniably beautiful and relevant arcs. From leadership to heroism\\, from choosing a side to knowing who you are\\, the lessons learned by the audience and the characters of this film flow freely\\, yet intertwine together in a way not many other films can pull off. \\n\\nRian Johnson had ambition with this film\\, he wanted to make a statement\\, to create something worthy of the title Star Wars. To make fans question all they knew about it\\, to make them think. To make them believe again\\, to give them hope. The Force Awakens was a dream come true\\, a fun fairytale acting as a gateway to a new era of Star Wars. The Last Jedi is reality\\, what represents Star Wars truly (alongside the originals). RJ's understanding of not only the messages George Lucas portrayed but also the potential and opportunity he held within his own hands was much more so than that of JJ Abrams'. He looked at the franchise and thought \\\"How can I make this legendary? How can I make my film not simply a facade of what this franchise is\\, but the rich contents of what it can be\\, what it should be?\\\". And in my opinion\\, he succeeded in a way only George Lucas could. The difference between him and George\\, however\\, was that George didn't have any expectations placed on him\\, any diehard fans to live up to\\, while Rian had all of that and more. And the thing is\\, he lived up to those expectations by not living up to them. He didn't care about what fans wanted\\, or what they had all wrote in their heads\\, he cared about the saga\\, about moving Star Wars forward\\, about writing a good story. And he did just that.","true":true}
