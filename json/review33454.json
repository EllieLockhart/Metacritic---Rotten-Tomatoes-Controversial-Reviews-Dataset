Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Actual fans of Star Wars with expectations surrounding these legendary characters will be sorely disappointed. The story is full of plot holes. Rampant political messaging has taken the forefront over good storytelling\\, and this trainwreck makes the prequels seem competent. This film absolutely betrays the character of Luke Skywalker\\, and completely ignores its own logical gaps in the pursuit of what seems to be a feminist sjw agenda. Star Wars under Kathleen Kennedy has ceased to be Star Wars at all. One star to be certain that its counted (It would be zero otherwise).","true":true}
