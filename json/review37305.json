Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot in this movie was desperately struggling to make sense.  I'm completely blown away that there were so many plot holes or completely unbelievable assumptions made by characters (I'm looking at you Leia with the whole they must have new tech to track us through hyperspace all while she is wearing a bracelet that is broadcasting her exact location to the whole galaxy.  But no\\, it can't be the bracelet\\, that would make to much sense for this movie)(or you Rose where in the span of 1 minute she went from \\\"But that tech is impossible\\\" to \\\"this is exactly how that would work and where we can find it on the enemy ship and how to turn it off\\\"). \\n\\nOut of the three major subplots in the film the one with Mark Hamill and Rey made the most sense.....Sorta.  The character that Mark Hamill played in this movie was interesting and entertaining and had a good chemistry with Rey. Unfortunately Mark Hamill's character didn't really feel like Luke Skywalker at all.  But then again the men in the Skywalker family do have a tendency to go from plucky and personable youth to crotchety D-bag so I guess Luke has more in common with Anakin and Ben Solo then I would have thought.","true":true}
