Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leia Poppins says everything you need to know about what a disappointment this film was.  We have 6 movies of worldbuilding and framework\\, and both TFA and this film basically ignore it.  Less fan service than in TFA\\, but overall this film falls flat.","true":true}
