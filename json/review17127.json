Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie\\, there were so many unexpected twists and surprises. I love how I came into this movie with so many questions then leave with none of them answered but not care (in a good way). Contrary to others opinions I liked Luke Skywalker struggling with his famous status as it created an interesting and original story line in the movie. However I feel like the movie could have been shorter. I wouldn't have mind if they shorten the casino planet side plot as it barely contributed to the main story line and was slightly boring. Overall I expected a movie following the same plot of Empires Strikes Back but it turned out to be totally bold and original leaving me wondering how the saga continues.","true":true}
