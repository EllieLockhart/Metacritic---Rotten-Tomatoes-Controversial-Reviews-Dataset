Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me passionate about Star Wars in a way I haven't been since I was a kid. \\n\\nA solid action blockbuster with beautifully complex and diverse characters. I am absolutely in love with the addition of Rose and her scenes with Finn and Poe were fantastic. The addition of more relatable characters only further fleshes our the universe and makes it feel more real. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren has become lightning in a bottle. The previous movie was incredible as well\\, but Johnson's writing between the two had me sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what would happen next. The struggle of Luke Skywalker was beautifully done and shows that even our most beloved heroes have conflict and doubts within them.\\n\\nI grew up with Star Wars and this film is easily among the top for me.","true":true}
