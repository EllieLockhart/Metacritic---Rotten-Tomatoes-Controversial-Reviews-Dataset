Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked into this movie really excited to see the story of Rey & Luke\\, see the way they would interact and work together to fight the First Order\\, and perhaps answer a few of the excellent questions left hanging open from the Force Awakens.  I walked out of this movie not caring that Luke Skywalker\\, a boyhood hero\\, just died.  \\n\\nThe new Force \\\"tricks\\\" (death defying Mary Poppins\\, cross galaxy telepathy)\\, the Guardians of the Galaxy type humor\\, and the slow development of the plot were painful to watch.  The portrayal of Luke Skywalker was the worst offense in this film\\, however.  A trilogy of character development was thrown away with one light saber toss over a shoulder as the Luke in the film was a change too far from base character.  He could have been any old\\, snarky flippant Jedi recluse and I would have cared more about his self sacrifice by the time it inevitably came.","true":true}
