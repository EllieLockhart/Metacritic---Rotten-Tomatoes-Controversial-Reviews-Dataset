Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s refreshing to see this film tread new ground\\, the relationship between Kylo and Rey is probably the most complex and nuanced that we\u2019ve ever seen in a Star Wars film. The new direction had me feeling more like the first time I watched Return of the Jedi than in any of the 5 films that followed after. The hate this film is grabbing is unwarranted and based only on unmet expectations. It\u2019s fine to not like the direction the film took\\, but that in no way shape or form makes it a bad film. To state otherwise only serves to make you look foolish.","true":true}
