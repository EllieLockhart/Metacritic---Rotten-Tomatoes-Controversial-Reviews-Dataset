Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great special effects but none of the magic of the Star Wars franchise. Not recommended. \\n\\nThe character of Luke is destroyed and the development of the Snoke\\, Ren\\, Ray is little to none.\\n\\nA wasted opportunity.  \\n\\nNever thought I'd say this but Phantom Menace was better. Bring back Lucas.","true":true}
