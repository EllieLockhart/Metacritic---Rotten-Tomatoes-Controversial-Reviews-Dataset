Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't want to ramble on about all the things they did to ruin Star Wars for mature\\, serious fans of the franchise because all the points have already been covered.  However\\, I will say that Disney absolutely ruined Star Wars for me.  The story was upended and slowly turned into the same old Disney motto\\, \\\"Anyone can be great!\\\"  We have plenty of children's stories that pound this into your head.  Star Wars is more than that.  I appreciated The Force Awakens for it's suspense building plot lines and I thought Rogue One was an interesting look into Rebels on the front line of the battles\\, but this one..... this one was much more than disappointing.  I will not watch another Star Wars movie.  Even Mark Hamill expressed his concerns for the movie before \\\"apologizing\\\" for doing so.","true":true}
