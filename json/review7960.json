Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing\\, takes a dump on Star Wars and expects me to clap for it. \\nSeriousness ruined by poor comedy\\nNo Character development whatsoever\\nPrequel like scenes and humour\\nWasted Potential\\nLack of focus\\nNo meaningful connections or expansions to the Force Awakens\\nPoor middle man and anyone who compares this to Empire is out of their mind.","true":true}
