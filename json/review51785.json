Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Admittedly was frustrated at first\\, but the more I chew on it\\,  the more I've come to appreciate the choices Rian made. The biggest issue for SW:TLJ is us. We hyped it up with fan theories and were upset they didn't come true. Watch the movie as it's supposed to be\\, a sequel to TFA.","true":true}
