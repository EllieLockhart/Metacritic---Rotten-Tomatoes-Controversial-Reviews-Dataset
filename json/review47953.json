Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it has its moments\\, this film ultimatly falls short of living up to the Star Wars legacy. The characters and plot remain undeveloped\\, despite this being the second of the newer films. While funny in parts\\, this comedic relief did little to supplement the story\\, if only to distract the viewer from the otherwise lackluster plot. Sorry to say but if you are a fan of the original Star Wars movies\\, this just isn't the same Star Wars you used to know and love.","true":true}
