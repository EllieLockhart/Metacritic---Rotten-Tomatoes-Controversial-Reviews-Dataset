Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi might not be for everybody--but it is far and away the best Star Wars movie since Empire.\\n\\nThat said\\, it's a difficult movie. It's long\\, a lot goes on\\, the plot is stressful\\, but this is all in service of the most thematically rich Star Wars ever\\, one that zeroes in on what made the 1977 origin tick: that it was a story about a nobody (Luke) who by chance finds himself thrust into a conflict bigger than himself and who must learn to put his idealism to use in the service of others. The Last Jedi doubles down in this premise--it's a movie about the nobodies matter\\, a movie about how the people who move history are not just knights\\, lords\\, and politicians\\, but everyday people grappling with a complicated moral universe. It's a masterpiece in it's own right and a true return to form for the franchise.","true":true}
