Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was different then any other Star Wars movie. This is what made it so great\\, it is 100% a movie that should be seen twice\\, to really capture every little detail and to let it really sink in how important this movie is to the Star Wars Universe. This movie has the best scenes a Star Wars movie has ever seen as well. I am not sorry to all the theorist that got their hopes shot down when what they thought with Snoke and Rey didn't come true. This movie perfectly set up Rey and Kylo for the future of Star Wars and the next\\, generation.","true":true}
