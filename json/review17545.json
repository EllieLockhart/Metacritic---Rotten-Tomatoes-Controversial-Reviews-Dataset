Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to write this review and to point out to all the critics who are dismissing the fans opinions as just an obsessive backlash\\, that this is not case\\, I'm a real person who just watched something I love die a slow and painful death.\\nEveryone has there own opinion and if you liked this then that's up to you\\, but just because I don't like this movie doesn't make me a hater who was not going to like this film regardless. I love Star Wars and I went to see this with every hope of loving this film\\, but it's full of plot holes\\, at parts looks more like Harry Potter than Star Wars and does its very best to destroy an iconic character. It goes on too long and really has very little plot to it\\, main characters are killed off with no explanation where they came from\\, while some reveals try so hard to be surprising they become hugely underwhelming.","true":true}
