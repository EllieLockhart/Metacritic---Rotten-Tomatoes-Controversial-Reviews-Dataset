Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film. Looks like strange remake of ep V and VI. But with stupid humour and very obtrusive fan service.\\nThe Last Jedi destroy all hope. \\nAll characters.\\nAll what we had after The Force Awakens.","true":true}
