Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is an extremely entertaining film packed with stunning effects\\, emotion\\, great acting\\, and battle sequences you should expect. It is not without its flaws though; the first act is a bit messy\\, part of the story arc (including a couple of character events such as Leia\u2019s) seemed strange\\, and some CGI scenes were unnecessary to me. Otherwise this film is fantastic. ","true":true}
