Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has lots of what I wanted to see but more of what I needed\\, and that's not pure fun for many people\\, but it should be appreciated for what it is--a statement about creative destruction and the truth that\\, yes\\, it is necessary\\, but it cannot be controlled. The destroyers often assume that they will be the ones to decide what comes next\\, but there are too many free souls in the galaxy for everything to go to plan. After one plan is disrupted\\, the only reliable result is chaos. The next plan is up to the next generation\\, not to the destroyers and not necessarily to those with ties to the old guard.\\n\\nAlso\\, animal rights\\, astral projection\\, icewolves\\, furby birds\\, absolute silence and the end of flyboy logic.  \\n\\nIt's a great film. Fans need to get over the fact that it's not going to go the way they think. Watch it as a new verse - part echo and part something different and good\\, if not great\\, in its own right.","true":true}
