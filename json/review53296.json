Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Congratulations to Rian Johnson for managing to take a franchise with a pre-built structure that works\\, charismatic heroes in the universe\\, young talents introduced into the universe\\, powerful and intriguing villains and a plan the previous director outlined to help\\, throwing said help away and then taking a big massive dump all over everything. \\n\\nYou turned the most iconic hero of all time into an old\\, fearful and rude person who basically disowns family and friends because 'reasons'. You screw up the mythos and manage to waste an entire movie on a plot and sub plot that make no sense\\, write yourself into a corner... And break more rules to get out. Instead of creating strong female characters\\, you make strong willed idiots who cant coordinate with their crew or almost kill the one they just met but somehow love\\, trying to save him\\, and thus stopping him from a noble sacrifice to save everyone... And show in the background the consequences of your stupid incoherent writing.\\n\\nYou have a fancy lightsaber fight where the  bad guys are so confident with their abilities they throw their weapons away or you cg them away!! You kill said bad guy without giving any idea of his history and how the hell he is so strong... I mean... Wow this movie is terrible. It is absolutely terrible. \\n\\nYou also waste an amazing actress (Fazma) and uturn character progression for Finn and Poe because you're an egotistical idiot. Good bloody job. JJ didn't do a great job in the first one but you definitely won the award for the most disappointing movie of the century and even though we still have 81 years left I am confident you will win.\\n\\nDon't watch this trash. RIP Luke Skywalker. You will always be one of my heroes no matter how a script tries to destroy you!","true":true}
