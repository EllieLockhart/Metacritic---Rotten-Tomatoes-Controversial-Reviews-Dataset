Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most adorable star wars yet. Disney is making its own rules with this one. Anyone can come back to life or create duplicates. Pointless characters and creatures are created and removed to fill gaps and sell toys. And there are so many tangent story lines that the timing is off.  Writing sux. At least there's cool cinematography. Sorry\\, Attack of The Clones\\, your no longer the weakest.","true":true}
