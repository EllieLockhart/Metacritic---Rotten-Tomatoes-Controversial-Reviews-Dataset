Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only mild spoilers:\\n\\n-Luke was treated poorly by the script and director. \\n\\n-Much of what was interesting about TFA is now rendered useless and evidently we should feel dumb for being upset about that. \\n\\n-This movie does not fit with the rest of Star Wars and probably ranks below everything else but phantom menace. \\n\\n-Well acted\\, but the ENTIRE Rose and Finn story doesn't matter. SERIOUSLY.  Only change? Maybe Phasma lives. \\n\\n-This would be fine for a new trilogy but it ruins the entire Skywalker saga. The only one left is a Solo. \\n\\n-And really? After finding out Carrie passed\\, all you have to do is remove the last 5 minutes of Luke and then he can help in Episode IX.  Now there's nothing. I'm honestly not excited for the final movie. \\n\\n-And no\\, I'm not a Disney hater. I loved TFA.","true":true}
