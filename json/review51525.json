Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete mess of a movie with most of it feeling forced and stilted.  No character progression and bad writing leading to nonsense decisions made by the characters because they had been written into a corner.  This movie made me think that I had been too critical of \\\"Phantom Menace\\\".","true":true}
