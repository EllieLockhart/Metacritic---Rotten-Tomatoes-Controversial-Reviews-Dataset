Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than The Force Awakens\\, yet it didn\u2019t hit the mark for me. Seems like Disney is hiring the biggest guns possible to help make Star Wars a fan favorite again with a new trilogy that seems to be as confused of the direction it\u2019s heading\\, like Kylo Ren himself. No matter how much Disney invests in this or any other Star Wars trilogy\\, seems like nothing can surpass Empire Strikes Back. ","true":true}
