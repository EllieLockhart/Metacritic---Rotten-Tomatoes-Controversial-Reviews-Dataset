Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. No previously made questions were answered\\, no character development\\, no real fight scenes\\, NO continuity with what all Star Wars movies have shown us about the force and how to use it. Rey is really good with the lightsaber just 'cause. She didnt have any training whatsoever and is already more powerful that Kylo who actually did train and has been training all his life.","true":true}
