Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally SJW driven. They made Finn a coward again in the beginning. So I guess he just forgot how brave he was at the end or 7. Rose just kissed Finn just because she thinks it's okay. Ray can do anything. And they pissed on Luke.","true":true}
