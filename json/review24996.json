Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My opinion of The Last Jedi has improved a bit now that I've seen The Rise of Skywalker. It's still not the best Star Wars movie ever as it has some scenes that really turned me off\\, but it is better than The Force Awakens. Luke is awesome in this movie both on the island and later on. It really caps off his experience in the Star Wars saga and caps off the saga as a whole\\, even the prequels\\, in a satisfying way. The way that this movie ties up loose ends and puts the prequels and original trilogy into context make it worth watching even with its many flaws.","true":true}
