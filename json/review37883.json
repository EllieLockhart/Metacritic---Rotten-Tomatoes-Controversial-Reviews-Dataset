Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The scenes didnt seem to fit together.  Like the filmed it and then kinda pieced it all together to make a move with a beginning and end but forgot to make it all flow together.","true":true}
