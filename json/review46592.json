Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watch this movie without any high expectations\\, and you should find it entertaining. However\\, the story itself is pretty bad. There were some scenes that just felt out of place and scenes that tried to constantly pull the rug under you that it makes you come out of the theater feeling like there was something off about this movie. As for the main characters\\, aside from Kylo Ren\\, the character development is seriously lacking in most of them. They all feel flat and uninteresting. Overall\\, this episode was entertaining to watch\\, but the story was disappointing and could have definitely been better given Disney's production value. Hopefully\\, they'll pull out all the stops in the next movie.","true":true}
