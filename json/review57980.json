Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When this movie came out to high critical reviews and low audience reviews\\, I was happy. I was like\\, ah yes\\, the Star Wars dweebs are getting their dreams smashed and expectations shattered and I was relishing in it because I'm not that big into Star Wars. That being said\\, I didn't see it\\, because I'm not that big into Star Wars. Eventually\\, I thought I would give it a shot\\, though\\, just to see what it was like. And holy smokes\\, I am so sorry for doubting you\\, fans. A lot of things seem to happen in this movie *just because* they divert expectations\\, but not because they actually make sense within the confines of the plot or the lore that I am aware of. Part of me wants to explain what these things are\\, but that would be spoiling a movie that I hope you never have to see.","true":true}
