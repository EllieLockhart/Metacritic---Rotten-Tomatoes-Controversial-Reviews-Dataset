Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story line was not what I was hoping for as a life long Star Wars fan. Too many holes in the story. I may change my opinion after I see how it ties in with episode IX but as of now a bit of a letdown ","true":true}
