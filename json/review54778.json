Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has a tons of flaws and it's not a terrible movie\\, it's just... Okay. I wish I could say it's underrated entry of the series\\, but despite it Carrie Fisher's last film to go out on with some memorable lines\\, John Williams score and the action was very good. In other way\\, I may find this a disappointing\\, it should being a hell a lot better","true":true}
