Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a stunning achievement.  It was a good Star Wars film\\, yes\\, but it was also more than a Star Wars film.  Director Rian Johnson weaves a tale with much more depth and character development than is typical in this series\\, while still delivering on spectacle and awe-inspiring visuals.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.","true":true}
