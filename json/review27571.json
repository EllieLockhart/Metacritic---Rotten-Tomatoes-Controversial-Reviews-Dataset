Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, this is one of the best Star Wars movies of all time. It has a few minor issues\\, but my main complaint is the fact that they passed on an opportunity to make a necessary massive change to the universe. Other than that\\, this was an absolutely beautify shot film\\, and a good time for any Star Wars fan.","true":true}
