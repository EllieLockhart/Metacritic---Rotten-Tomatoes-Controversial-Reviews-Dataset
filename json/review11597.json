Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible! This is really the WORST star wars movie\/television show ever made. I put this under the holiday special. The script is horrible! The logic is something a 4th grader would be ok with\\, but no one else. Epic slow space chases? Luke comes back as a jerk? Luke never fights anyone? Rose is the new jar jar. Finn is wasted\\, Poe is made out to be a moron. This is GARBAGE! For the 1st time\\, I don't care about star wars anymore. Kathleen kennedy killed star wars for me.","true":true}
