Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm absolutely confused by the public reaction to this movie. I loved it. It goes quite far with the Force\\, and there are bits that seem superfluous (although they bring a good dose of realism to the Star Wars universe)\\, but overall the story progressed and I had a good time watching it.","true":true}
