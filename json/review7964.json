Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing - This movie is a complete insult to Star Wars. They desecrated Luke Skywalker's character and the Jedi Order. The story is flawed with missing character development. What...? There is no Good\/Bad force now? WTF  - This isn't Star Wars","true":true}
