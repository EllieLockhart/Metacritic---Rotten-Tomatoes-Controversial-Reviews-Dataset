Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. Attack of the Clones was a snoozefest\\, but The Last Jedi took that to new levels. The CGI was bad\\, the story was bad\\, everything was bad. I'm not captivated by the characters at all\\, and I don't want to see what happens next.","true":true}
