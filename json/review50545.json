Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2nd best in the entire series\\, it will be hard for anything to top empire strikes back but i feel this movie comes close\\, there is so much in this film and i can feel what disney is pushing for. when they keep bringing up letting the past go i feel its a reference to the eu\\, even with the \\\"supposed\\\" destruction of the anicent text again i feel they are meant to represent the eu books. cant wait to see where they go in the next movie.","true":true}
