Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who isn't a Star Wars fan\\, to watch JJ Abrams set up a dull trilogy in Force Awakens was yawn inducing as I noticed every beat the final installment would have to hit when he returned to direct and I was not excited for this\\, and I imagine neither was Rian Johnson\\, God bless him! When you allow a director to do \\\"anything\\\" in the middle installment\\, and to watch him do JUST that\\, DESTROYING the road map by evaporating the pieces set up for the next film that were essential in this won made me watch with a mischievous grin at the 2 1\/2 hours of anarchy. It's like if the \\\"No\\, I am your father\\\" moment was stretched out into an entire film\\, and that's why it's my favorite to date. 9\/10","true":true}
