Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The director added a sex scene of him **** the transgender protagonist \u201cAbby\u201d and spits on Joel\u2019s body after he\u2019s killed by her. After Ellie spends the rest of the game hunting and looking for revenge and redemption she comes within inches of killing Abby but decides to let her go. Nothings wrong with the fact Abby is trans\\, nothing is wrong with the LGBTQ aspects of this game. What is wrong is the lousy and poorly written story\\, Joel\u2019s deserved to die saving Ellie and Abby should\u2019ve been killed by Ellie. In my opinion The Last of Us never had a sequel and it\u2019s still my favourite game of all time\\, Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann had a game of the decade winning masterpiece with The Last of Us (2013) but couldn\u2019t keep it up with The Last of Us II. We don\u2019t mind the LGBTQ\\, we actually embrace it. What we don\u2019t like is our generation defining and masterpiece being kicked into the dirt just to endorse those groups of people even if it doesn\u2019t make sense for the story and\/or just destroys it completely\\, whilst mostly this is a very lacklustre and abomination of what The Last of Us (2013) have us 7 years ago\\, there are some scenes in the game that are hard hitting and strike us in the emotions just like the last game did. But that will never be enough to redeem it from the kind of torture the second game out its fans through. Please don\u2019t apologise\\, don\u2019t try and justify your decisions. Just accept the fact you knew what your audience wanted but you still pandered to a minority just to be more inclusive. To the team that developed the game and weren\u2019t allowed to suggest ideas or express any negative feelings to the game during its development in order not to be branded a \u201cphobe\u201d or an \u201cist\u201d or even yet in to not lose your job. Our hurt and pain isn\u2019t directed at you. It\u2019s directed at the narcissistic leader Neil.    A heartbroken TLOU lover\u2026 Expand","true":true}
