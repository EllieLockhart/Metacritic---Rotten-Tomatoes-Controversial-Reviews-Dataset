Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nope I did not like Star Wars! Way too long and overstuffed. Overall mehh! Interested to see the general audiences reaction to the film. It's definitely worth noting this was the first time I seen a Star Wars Movie opening day and no audience applause at the end (even from a sold out crowd) ?? I'm predicting this could be a mixed bag with families #TheLastJedI","true":true}
