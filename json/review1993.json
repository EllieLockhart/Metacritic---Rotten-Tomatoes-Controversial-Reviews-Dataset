Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As others have posted\\, this movie was terrible. It really isn't a Star Wars movie and threw away everything we knew and loved about Luke. I agree with all of the other comments here regarding the terrible aspects of the movie\\, but also just as a movie in general\\, it was awful. The pacing and storytelling was chaotic and choppy - perhaps to cater to the younger generation with no attention span? There were storylines and characters (Rose) that could have been removed and would not have changed the story in the end. I felt frustrated throughout the movie and left the theater feeling heartbroken.","true":true}
