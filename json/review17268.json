Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I avoided spoilers. Kept an open mind. I was excited to see what Rian Johnson would do because I am a fan of his work. I was disappointed. The only thing that made this worthwhile for me was the acting. Even with my issues\\, everyone sold their performances and there are some things that I did like. I just feel like what they did with Poe was contrived. I liked Finn and Rose\\, but their little adventure did nothing for me. I don't want to spoil anything\\, but Rey and Snoke. Rey and Snoke. I'll just say this. With Rey\\, they made all the teasing in The Force Awakens meaningless. It was a middle finger to that movie. It feels like they was on one path with The Force Awakens\\, and then chose to go down another\\, and then made another course correction\\, for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
