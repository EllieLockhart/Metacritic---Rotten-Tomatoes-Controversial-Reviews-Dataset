Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics must have been watching a different movie. This should be around 30% Rotten not 91% fresh. Solo was better than this movie by far. This movie has soooo many problems that it just make me sad. If they removed all the scenes with Rose( including the entire trip to the casino and that pointless sub-plot thing)\\, Had Luke not vanish in the end\\, Remove Luke milking the cow things\\, take the part with chewy and the plastic chicken\\, let Leia die in space....Re-do the battle with Snok....hmmm not much left that is salvageable.","true":true}
