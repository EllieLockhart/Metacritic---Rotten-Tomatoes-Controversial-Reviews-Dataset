Given the fact that this is where the game really shines\\, none of that can be judged after 3 hours.\r\rSo it all comes down to review bombing. And there are a lot of reasons that motivate it:\r\r- Story leaks that led to hasty judgments of the plot\r- Hate on Naughty Dog because of the restrictive policy in dealing with these leaks\r- Inability or displeasure in dealing with difficult issues or ways of storytelling\r- Political agendas about SJWS\r- Envy towards the PS and its exclusives\r\rThe reasons not to bomb the game would be millions. I let the numberless positive reviews stand for themselves. All is said about what a blast the game is in every way. Unfortunately it fell victim to an idiotic cyber mob that did explicitly not judge the quality of the game because 90% of them did not even play it ...\r\rI rate 10. After 2 playthroughs.
