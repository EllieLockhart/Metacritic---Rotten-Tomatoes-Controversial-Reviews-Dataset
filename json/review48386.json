Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all of the excitement that The Last Jedi brings us from the constant feeling of being at the edge of our seats. Having a lot of duels between characters that fans have been waiting for\\, having heartbreaking moments\\, this movie really connects with the other Star Wars movie despite having completely different material and sending a new message to fans\\, you don't have to be anyone well known to be special.","true":true}
