Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"dont have to be star wars fanatic to love this movie. one of the most aesthetically beautiful movies ive seen. great story line and perfect ending for those who understand the star wars universe. next movie should be very action packed and just as if not better.","true":true}
