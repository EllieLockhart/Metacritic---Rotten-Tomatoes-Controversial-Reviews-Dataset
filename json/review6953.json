Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the best Star Wars films to have ever come out. I don\u2019t quite understand what movie these other fans saw and it all seems like they\u2019re nitpicking just for the fun of it. This movie is a must see. Slower build and pacing than the Force Awakens\\, but still interesting and entertaining from start to finish.","true":true}
