{"101487":113507,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Comments here have said it all but I can't help myself. I was never a great SW fan but watched the films with interest when they were worth watching\\, and I liked TFA and was very curious about Episode 8. Hence my astonishment at how truly awful this movie was. Here's a few ways I see this movie has completely failed:\\n1. Seven previous films built up to the series' big spiritual question of whether the Good Side of the Force can prevail. This question was beautifully set up in TFA with the island setting and an intriguing reference to a \\\"balance\\\" of light and dark rather than a battle between them. This arc is COMPLETELY ABANDONED - the Force is disparaged\\, by Luke of all people\\, as an old obsolete silly obsession. Move on\\, fuggetaboutit. (Good lord\\, what is SW without its spiritual questions? It's just shoot-em-up space adventure.)\\n2. Related problem: TFA references a \\\"Jedi Temple\\\" where the balance of the Force was originally studied\\, a kind of galactic monastery. The map leading to Luke is actually a map to that Temple and the island is obviously the location of that Temple. Calling up Buddhist practices\\, this Temple is clearly the site of ancient study of everything spiritually to do with how the whole universe is supposedly put together and therefore a site of spiritual power and contending forces. Recalling the teeny version of this when Luke faced the Dark Side in the cave\\, this was ripe for fantastic visuals with creative special effects\\, plus the big chance to deepen our understanding of the Force beyond light sabers to the source of it all. What ho... COMPLETELY ABANDONED. Aside from a scary hole\\, the true heart of the Temple is portrayed as a giant ancient tree with a few moldy books\\, of all things (in this hi-tech world)\\, that Yoda happily blows up\\, effectively saying\\, silly old temple\\, silly old ancient knowledge\\, fuggetaboutit\\, move on!  Be in the now! That isn't Buddhist insight\\, it's just shallow\\, banal\\, anti-intellectual\\, be-stupid dogma. \\n3. Second related issue: Rey's abilities are clearly vastly stronger than anyone else in the series. She learned some survival fighting tricks from her life as a scavenger\\, but she's obviously a Force autodidact who can whack even Kylo Ren in open battle just be recalling the existence of the Force. She's a born Force genius. How did that happen? How is she? And what is she going to do with this genius talent? Fascinating opportunity to explore what it means for a major character to have that kind of power going up against an overwhelming enemy. At the very least\\, the question of her abilities was ripe for exploration and the answer was pending ... but COMPLETELY TOSSED. (Except I'd suggest that the \\\"you know the truth about your parents - they were nobodies\\\" moment wasn't something that should necessarily be taken as true - the flashback in TFA suggests Rey was one of Luke's younger apprentices at the time of the Kylo Ren debacle and that her parents escaped that mess in a ship\\, which meant they had access to one\\, which meant they weren't nobodies. The implication was always that Luke or some Skywalker kin was on that ship and this angle could still come back in Episode 9.)\\nCHARACTERS - \\n1. Luke. Staggering disappointment. The sadder and wiser Force elder could well have been portrayed as deeply discouraged and still have the grit and insight to take Rey's arrival as the momentous event it indeed was. But falling apart into utter cynicism about the Force and wasting his life? Eradicated everything about Luke's character and role in the saga. Having him evaporate at the end was simply a cop out so he'd be out of the way in the general house-cleaning this film aimed to accomplish. Could that be a valuable \\\"let's move on\\\" decision? Director Johnson's decision not to give Luke so much as a 15-second reaction shot to Han's death tells us\\, no\\, the aim was to negate everything that had happened in the past as needless impediments to a complete reimagining of the whole series for an Episode 9 that now we have no motive to see. WRONG PERSON WRONG FILM. \\n2. Leia - sigh. So much for Leia\\, Ruined forever by that nonsense Mary Poppins scene. (Word to sci fi directors: always be sure your film can pass the fifth-grade scence test.)\\n3. Kylo Ren - sigh. The script demolishes his entire arc ... for what? Again\\, TLJ treats the past as garbage: throw it out\\, move on\\, no explanation. The whole twist in Kylo Ren's character also comes off as though the adult has walked into the room and snapped off the TV. Of course that mask was essentially stupid. Of course his trying to be his grandfather was idiotic\\, blilnd to history\\, to facts\\, to the actually legacy and lesson of his grandfather\\, including the great victory associated with his grandfather's redemption. But that raised the big question - why was Kylo Ren taking that strange route? It wasn't just idle play-acting: killing his father was idiotic\\, for the same reasons\\, but it was also deeply evil. What mattered in TFA was that all this foolery clearly spoke of something deeper about Kylo Ren - that although his mother refused to accept it\\, he's a profoundly and permanently corrupted\\, evil person. Luke established the \\\"thou shalt not commit patricide\\\" principle of redemption in Episode Six. So Kylo Ren has damned himself for eternity: redemption from killing his father\\, in the SW universe? Not going to happen. So what conceivably CAN happen to Kylo Re now\\, after he's given up his twisted plan for himself? He can't go back and he can't go forward. He's neutralized as a character.\\n4. Snoke - always boring\\, remained boring. At least he's gone. Can't SW come up with any arch-villain worth anything? If it's actually about the truly empty quality of pure evil (which is cutting the scriptwriters far more slack than they probably deserve) at least put this back into series' concerns with the Force. \\n5. Poe - the dashing hero\\, given some attractive character and humor in TFA\\, now slapped down like a bad kid. Of course thoughtless single-minded hero antics can get you into trouble\\, but the SW universe was always about such antics\\, as talented rogue heroes bucked cautionary advice from their compadres to save the day. You accept that hero action figures are central to the story or you don't watch the series. The only restraint on their making it up as they go along is the Force\\, to which they are supposed to \\\"listen\\,\\\" Poe can't do that\\, true\\, but then neither could Han. And Han had crucial hero roles to play anyway. So again\\, it's as though some self-appointed \\\"adult\\\" has come along and said\\, oh that tosh\\, that's got to go: \\\"Old-style hero antics are SO Episode Six! No more of that!\\\" So Poe's character is neutralized\\, too. So what can we expect now from Poe? Reaction shots\\, maybe??\\nPLOT\\n1. There's nothing to this movie whatever that advances the saga. Instead\\, we get spinning wheels. At the beginning\\, evil has mysteriously triumphed again. Everything that follows is simply regurgitated with a few new special effects. All the old tropes are there but now stale and shopworn: the obligatory bar scene; ships flying around blasting each other bang pow CRASH; pilots shouting nonsense at each other\\, chase here\\, chase there\\, more bang pow CRASH. At some point in all this I started checking my mobile phone for emails. There was some perplexing time-wasting part about rich gamblers in a fancy posh setting that for no reason whatever the normally perspicacious Finn finds initially attractive until he realizes it's all shallow - gosh\\, should it take more than 10 seconds for anybody to recognize a casino as a casino? And was this really something Finn\\, of all people\\, needed to learn when his whole arc was about being torn between fight or flight with the fascist galactic government? It's as though Johnson had never actually watched this series\\, or as though a script writer for this film had discovered\\, after some drunken weekend bash\\, that Las Vegas is a morally gutted town of pure crap and wanted to share this great discovery with a world audience. Gosh\\, who knew? Ludicrous point to make in a SW episode. \\nI could go on but the other thousands of comments here have already said it all. The only real mystery is who's manipulating RT web page to foreground positive reviews when so many excellent negative ones here are far more representative of audience reactions. I guess RT isn't invulnerable to the Dark Side.","true":true}
