Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pointless B plot with Finn\/girl that didn't advance the plot at all. Lame \\\"chase\\\" in space... wait for the Resistance to run out of fuel? Poorly placed slapstick humor\\, failed in delivery of promised cliffhangers from TFA. \\n\\nOne of the biggest gripes I have is how the OT characters were ruined. 3PO\\, R2 and Chewy were just novelties in this film. Leia's Mary Poppins scene was cringe worthy. Yoda was shown as \\\"goofy\\\" yoda from ESB\\, which was a face he was putting on to test Luke\\, not wise Jedi Yoda. The biggest disappointment is how Luke was ruined. Luke stands for Hope\\, and through it all he was the only one who saw good in Darth Vader\\, who had killed countless innocent people. Yoda failed him\\, Obi Wan failed him. Luke tossed his lightsaber when confronted by Palpatine to kill his father because he saw this good in him. So how could it be that Luke could react by almost murdering his nephew by sensing a little bit of the Dark Side in him? \\n\\nAlso\\, Luke who always faced his challenges in person... he faced Vader at Cloud City\\, and turned himself over to Vader and Palpatine. The way he went out by projecting himself instead of just travelling there in person was not like Luke at all. He could have faced the same fate\\, or it's possible he could have lived if he went in person.","true":true}
