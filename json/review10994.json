Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having watched the movie\\, I am so appalled to find out that so many of those great stories from EU (now legend) I've experienced were thrown out to make room for this abomination... I mean\\, really? The story plots are so badly written and directed that what the film tried to tell me didn't even feel like a believable story. The \\\"great fleet chase\\\" that constitute the entire length of the film was utterly dumb in so many ways\\, which\\, in addition to many other scenes\\, told me that the screenwriter and the director have no idea how to write and direct a good story\/film\\, let alone a good Star Wars story\/film.  Jesus H Christ\\, Who in his\/her right mind picked these guys to make a Star Wars movie in the first place?","true":true}
