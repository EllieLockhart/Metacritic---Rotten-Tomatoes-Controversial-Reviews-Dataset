Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never buy tickets to this terrible movie. Disney is trying to ruin Star Wars for the fans and push their liberal agenda by making a Chinese girl into a main character. We do not even know what leia is anymore she is proudly a unicorn. I rather watch the phantom menace 50 times because it has more story and light saber duels unlike this movie and Luke a master Jedi gets beat by a noob (rey) that doesn't even know what the force is. Disney hates the fans never watching any of their movies ever again I would rate this movie a zero if i had to and Luke loves titty green milk.","true":true}
