Brave\\, moving and profound. TLOU2 doesn't pander to their audience. This game is not made to please its audience at the expense of the message it's trying to convey\\, quite the opposite\\, which really sets it apart from a vast amount of games out there.\r\rLeaving the plot and message aside\\, this game is more than a worthy sequel to the original TLOU. Technically\\, it's better in every aspect you could imagine: stunning graphics\\, probably the best we'll ever get to see on current hardware\\, beautiful scenery and fantastic level design which opens up so many different possibilities for you to solve the situations you encounter. It's also longer than the original\\, and I mean that in the best possible way. TLOU2 is remarkably generous. It's packed full of diverse content and unique scenarios which are overflowing with detail.\r\rIf I had to critique one thing I'd say Naughty Dog were a bit lazy with the character progression mechanism. In TLOU2\\, pills to unlock new character skills and nuts and bolts to upgrade our weapons make a reappearance\\, which is a bit out of place in such a grounded game where absolutely every single other mechanic and items we use has a purpose and fits perfectly into the world we're playing in and the story the came is unravelling before us.\r\rI will say no more as I could write pages upon pages about the virtues of this game. If you're looking for a bold\\, adult\\, thought-provoking story complemented with solid gameplay and you happen to own a PS4\\, I cannot recommend this game enough. And if you don't own a PS4\\, this game is definitely worth the purchase!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
