Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the 'original' Staqr Wars kids here. Saw it  MULTIPLE times in theaters in 1977. While not a 'home run'\\, I enjoyed most aspects of TLJ and have been urging friends who have not seen it not to listen to critics or 'polls'. Don't be a lemming decide for yourself.","true":true}
