Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally Disappointing \\, I hate where the trilogy is headed . I cannot say no more without spoilers . As a long time Star Wars fan since 77 I do not where Disney is taking the saga .  I kind of miss Lucas original vision.","true":true}
