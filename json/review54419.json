Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I legitimately feel depressed after waiting two years to see this film.  I have spent the last two weeks of my life marathoning every single Star Wars film\\, including the prequels\\, to psyche myself up for this.  \\n\\nI've been a fan of Star Wars for the past 21 years of my life\\, and this movie took a big steaming shit over everything I love about the franchise (including episode 7).\\n\\nCharacter motivations are out of wack.  A plot twist makes two of the characters entire plotline obsolete halfway through the movie.  All of the charm of Rey and Finn are missing\\, and the menacing yet innocent spark of Kylo Ren has all but faded.\\n\\nI truly grew to love these characters in TFA...and I feel this movie does not do them justice.  \\n\\nAnd Rian Johnson's interpretation of 'the force' is anime bullshit.  \\n\\nI can only hope the short 5 month wait for Solo will be worth it to wash the taste of this film out of my mouth.","true":true}
