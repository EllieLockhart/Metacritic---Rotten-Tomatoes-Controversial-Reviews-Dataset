Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot begin to describe how disappointed I was in this film. Hands down some of the worst writing I have ever experienced. Sad in such an iconic franchise that I grew to love over the years . This film\\, Rian Johnson\\, Disney just killed the entire star wars franchise in this long dragged out\\, pointless 2 1\/2 hour movie. 1 1\/2 Stars for the beautiful picture\\, everything else and I mean everything else was completely horrific to watch. I don\u2019t know how they come back from this. Hopefully JJ is a wizard and can fix this catastrophe created in TLJ. In my opinion the damage has been done\\, R.I.P. Starwars.","true":true}
