Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi\\, is a mess with a flying Space Jesus\\, anime like lightspeed ramming\\, or a 20 minute trip to a casino to virtue signal about how they hate the rich while not moving the story along is basically the gist of the movie.  All of the impactful moments are undercut with humor which often lands flat.  It  has no definable Star Wars moment\\, just a random set of things they set out because it looked cool.  \\\"All Flash no substance\\\" is probably how it should be categorized.  Pretty but rotten on the inside\\, if this was not a Star Wars movie it would rate higher\\, as it is part of canon it breaks the rules of the universe first set in the original trilogy\\, something even the prequels did not screw up.","true":true}
