Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie to date. Honestly\\, there was nothing shocking or jaw dropping that really occurred in my opinion. It was as if Rian Johnson knew what every Star Wars fan wanted to see but instead chose to go with some mediocre story of how the lines of good and evil can be blurry. Not to mention\\, the acting was\\, at times\\, terrible and at points the film was absolutely cheesy. This was Jar Jar Binks bad.","true":true}
