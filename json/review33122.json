Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a clich\u00e9 pile of garbage. As a Star Wars fan boy I love the original and the prequels but this Trilogy is so rushed filled with garbage plot holes it's not even funny. Obviously this cash cow franchise is only here so that Disney can just sell more toys to children.","true":true}
