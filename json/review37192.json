Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing which irritates me more than this crappy\\, sorry excuse for a Star Wars movie is the people who\\, in their position of trying to defend the indefensible\\, attack those who hate it and say we're not really fans\\, or we have no patience. \\n\\nLet me set all such people straight. \\n\\nI've been a fan of Star Wars since July 29\\, 1977. I saw the first movie multiple times (which was called \\\"Star Wars\\\" not this revisionist \\\"New Hope\\\" crap). I bought the soundtrack\\, the novelization\\, the merchandise (lots of merchandise). I saw each subsequent film multiple times (including the prequels). I have waited 34 years to see Luke Skywalker (not this bizarro\\, anti-Luke abomination which Disney created). \\n\\nDo not tell me I'm not a fan. \\n\\nDo not tell me I'm impatient. \\n\\nI was a fan before a vast majority of today's Star Wars fanboys (and girls) were even born. \\n\\nI know Star Wars. THIS was not Star Wars.?","true":true}
