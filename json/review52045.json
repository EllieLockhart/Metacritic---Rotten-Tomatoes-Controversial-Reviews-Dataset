Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After months of complaining about how TFA was too reminiscent of ANH\\, Star Wars delivers a film that takes the story and spins it on his head\\, giving the audience something incredibly new just as ESB did over thirty years ago. In response to this\\, people are now complaining that the film \\\"doesn't feel like Star Wars\\\" or \\\"it isn't true to the story.\\\" Being released in a society where tv shows such as Game of Thrones\\, Breaking Bad and Westworld dominate media\\, TLJ keeps with the times and takes a drawn out\\, well known genre and breathes new life into by purposely not conforming to the clich\u00e9s that have become all too predictable at this point. TLJ is an amazing movie with a strong plot\\, hauntingly relatable and intricate characters\\, and plenty of action and comedy throughout.","true":true}
