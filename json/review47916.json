Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I definitely understand what turns people off about this movie\\, I found more than enough good material to compensate. Things like the lightspeed ram\\, the throne room fight\\, and the Yoda cameo (I love Yoda) made this a must-watch. For those who think the bad material is too overwhelming\\, I point you to Endgame. Endgame has tone of flaws with its lack of action\\, character development\\, heart\\, and story for 90 minutes. However\\, the fantastic final act compensates for this and makes it a great film. That is how I feel about Last Jedi. It is very flawed\\, but also contains some of the best material in Star Wars history.","true":true}
