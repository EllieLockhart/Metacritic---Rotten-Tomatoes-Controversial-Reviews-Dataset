Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Edit 12\/21\/2019: I initially gave The last Jedi a bad review. Rotten tomatoes changed that review to 4 Stars. I had to come back and correct it. \\n\\nMany long time Star Wars fans are going to be livid about what Johnson and Kennedy have done to this franchise. New fans probably won't care one way or another and Disney will be able to sell merchandise to little children who loved the Porgs.","true":true}
