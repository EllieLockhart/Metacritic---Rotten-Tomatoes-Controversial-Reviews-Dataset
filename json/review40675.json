Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, without a doubt\\, the best Star Wars film to date. Time is spent to show complexities of Luke and Ben Solo's relationship. The force is explored and expanded. I don't understand the low reviews from the audience. From reading many of them\\, it seems they feel it's not true to the tone of past Star Wars movies. Thank goodness. Most of the Star Wars movies are horrible. The best before this one was Empire Strikes Back (by far). Last Jedi\\, while a departure from many past Star Wars movies\\, aligns well with Empire. \\nFantastic movie. So glad Rian gets to make more Star Wars films. Give me more like this one. This is what Star Wars should be.","true":true}
