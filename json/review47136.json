Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a load of rubbish this movie was how this has done well I'll never no\\n\\nwhere was the plot where was the action where was anything ?? \\n\\nthe movie made me feel robbed and unsatisfactory as it was just a mess and rush to the end \\n\\nTFA was not much better in my option but this is on a whole new level don't waste your time and money with such a mediocre film I'm sure you will all see it as it's star wars but not what we no and love this is so much worse","true":true}
