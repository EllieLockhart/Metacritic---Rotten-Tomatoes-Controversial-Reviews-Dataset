Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1\/2 star because it's the lowest possible rating.  I am not a bot\\, not trolling just to be divisive.  I just want my voice to join the masses that are frustrated because of the liberties taken by the director\\, producer\\, etc.  I feel like the propaganda about equality\\, human rights\\, etc. was forced on the millions of captive audience rather than writing a good plot.  Furthermore\\, now we're all being written off as a marginalized opinionated few\\, aka they don't like what we're saying so they just write us off saying the movie's success will be indicated by it's revenue.  WELL DUH!! Of course it's going to do amazing\\, it's Star Wars!  That's what I'm mad about.  The good name of Star Wars was used and abused to push an agenda\\, equality and social justice.  Leave that elsewhere\\, make the Star Wars movie a STAR WARS MOVIE.","true":true}
