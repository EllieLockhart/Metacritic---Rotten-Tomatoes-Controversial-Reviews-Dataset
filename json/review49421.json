Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst SW movie ever. For all you people faking it on this review feed\\, shame on you. We all know this movie had massive mistakes in it and it's just frustrating to see you pander to the terrible directors and producers of this film. It was truly awful\\, Rian Johnson should not have been given the reins to direct this movie (sorry). Also\\, all you people who say it's great literally say nothing else besides\\, \\\"it's great!\\\" If your only reason for liking the movie was because it had Yoda in it\\, or because other characters just made appearances\\, then your taste in this movie is truly shallow. Again\\, Worst Star Wars Movie Ever\\, period.","true":true}
