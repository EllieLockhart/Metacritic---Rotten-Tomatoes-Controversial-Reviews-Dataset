Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"someone wrote:\\n\\\"I don't know why everyone is being so negative about this film. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the best Star Wars films so far; in fact\\, it's almost as good as the original.\\\"\\n\\nWhat you just said is like entering a church (or a temple or a synagogue or a mosque) full of people immersed in prayer and meditation\\, strip naked\\, take a shit on the altar\\, masturbate and ejaculate over the presents while yelling profanities.\\n\\nYou should feel ashamed.","true":true}
