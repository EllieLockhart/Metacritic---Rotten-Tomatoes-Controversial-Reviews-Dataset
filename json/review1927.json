Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ask yourself simple questions\\, like...\\n\\nThe First Order ONLY has eight TIE Fighters at any one time?!\\n\\nA few TIE Fighters blew up Leia\u00e2(TM)s ship but can\u00e2(TM)t do that to the rest of the Resistance fleet? Instead they\u00e2(TM)re going to wait until the Resistance runs out of gas?\\n\\nThis is such poor filmmaking. Shame on Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy.","true":true}
