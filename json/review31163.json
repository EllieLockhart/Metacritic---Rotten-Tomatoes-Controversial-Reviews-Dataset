Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SO many haters. This is miles away the best movie not in the OG trilogy. It stays away from repeating itself while keeping the message and ethos intact while setting up a huge future of opportunity and new characters for the next generation. This trilogy is clearly about growth and learning from the past and being open for change and the future. It's a breathe of fresh air and has some of the best battles they've done.","true":true}
