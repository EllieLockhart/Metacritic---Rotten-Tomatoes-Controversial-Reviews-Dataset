Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worse Star Wars movie ever. It just doesn't make any sense. If the idea was to destroy the entire saga\\, well\\, guess what: they did it. I loved the original movie\\, I didn't dislike ep. 1-3\\, and I have given the benefit of doubt to The Force Awakens. But his movie is bullshit.","true":true}
