Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it and it was great for the most part. Only have a couple complaints. 1)  When did Leia start using the force to fly in space? I know the actor died but if you needed to take her out of the story for that reason that's the time to do it not some deus ex machina force powers saving her. And shes still alive\\, and they need to recast her. 2) The main character gets no real character development. What we get is that she was a girl from the middle of nowhere\\, which we already were told in the 7th movie. But it doesn't reveal anything interesting about her character in the movie other than she's as good as a person that trained under Luke AND Snoke without any combat training at all. She appears to be a fully formed main character right out of the gate with no growth so far 2 movies in the supposed trilogy. Fin and even the villain of the story\\, Kylo Ren\\, have had more development than your main character. Disney\\, pick it up.","true":true}
