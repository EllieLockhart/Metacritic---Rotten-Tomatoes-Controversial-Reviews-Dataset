Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie rating of 49 percent from audience members is far too high.\\n\\nRian Johnson has official become the enemy of Star Wars. His complete lack of care for the past or for the majority of the characters is simply heartbreaking. There isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been said\\, but recently he discussed Snoke and his past he said that he couldn't have revealed it.\\n\\nIn his words he stated that the only way that Snokes past could be revealed was if Snoke himself revealed his past through dialogue. He then went on to say that scene would have been cut out in the end.\\n\\nThis man is completely lacking of any imagination. Even people who fail film school still know that you show and you don't tell. The writing could have shown Snokes past. The writing could have hinted at it and still killed him off and it would have been better. A failed film student would have made a far better movie because they know the basics of good storytelling.\\n\\nI certainly believe that once the smoke and mirrors fall and the honeymoon phase is over\\, people will come back to this movie and realize how lacking of a story or a soul this movie truly had.\\n\\n1 star and it hurts me to give even that. The OG cast deserved so much better.","true":true}
