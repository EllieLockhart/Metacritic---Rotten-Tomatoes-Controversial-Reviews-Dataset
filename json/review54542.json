Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan. After watching The Force Awakens\\, I had no doubt that I'd love The Last Jedi. Every trailer left me so stoked; I joined in with everyone speculating what would happen. Would Rey turn to the dark side? Would we get to see Snoke fight? What would happen to Luke? I knew I would be blown away when it finally came out. And I was right; I was blown away- by how much I didn't like it.\\n\\nWhile I have my issues with the story\\, it's nothing I can't live with. I disagree with some of the decisions made\\, but if they lead into something great for IX then I'll be happy. What I really can't get behind\\, though\\, is the tone of the film. The tone was not Star Wars at all for half the movie. Constant quippy asides\\, annoying sight gags\\, bumbling slapstick; all things that felt completely out of place in the Galaxy Far\\, Far Away that we've all come to know over decades of film\\, games\\, books\\, and stories from both the old cannon and the new. The Last Jedi felt like everyone saw Guardians of the Galaxy and decided to (poorly) model VIII after it.\\n\\nBetween opening the film with an extended (and pretty lame) \\\"your mom!\\\" joke between Poe and Hux to BB-8 literally being mistaken for a slot machine by a drunk alien (and then filled with coins that he later shoots at an enemy in one of the cringiest scenes in the entire franchise)\\, to Luke Skywalker milking some giant four-breasted blue... thing\\, these awful\\, prequel-quality gags are everywhere- and don't even get me started on the damned Porgs. Ugh. \\n\\nThat's not to say that The Last Jedi is all bad. When it's good\\, it's *so* good. The moments that hit leave you staring wide-eyed at the awesome thing that happened\\, or hit with the emotion of the moment. The problem is\\, all of the incredible parts are buried within the rest of the movie. \\n\\nWhile it's not as bad as the prequels\\, it's not as good as the best films in the franchise either; it fits somewhere in between the greatness of the best and the awfulness of the worst. Frankly\\, it's just a letdown. After VII\\, we were all so excited for what would come next; the promises for the future of Star Wars were limitless\\, we had a whole new galaxy of amazing things to discover. The Force Awakens was a carefully crafted love letter to Star Wars fans\\, but The Last Jedi is more of a hasty typed Tinder message at 3am.","true":true}
