Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see it with a friend. The motivations of major characters escapes me. Kylo Ren is top of the list\\, really cannot understand why he does what he does. This disjointedness carries over into basic facts of the narrative. If the Rebel Alliance is really just 400 people\\, why is it significant in a galaxy of millions? I can suspend disbelief like a pro\\, but this is just sloppy.","true":true}
