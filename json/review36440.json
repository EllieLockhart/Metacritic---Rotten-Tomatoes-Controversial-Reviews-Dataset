Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most incoherent plot I've ever seen in a movie. And that is saying something. Visually stunning (hence 1 star)\\, but uncompelling otherwise. The other problem is that the whole movie feels like an exercise in nihilism. Nothing means anything and history cycles. If that's the case\\, why should I care?","true":true}
