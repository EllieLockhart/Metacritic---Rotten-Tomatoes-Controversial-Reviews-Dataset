Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, however perhaps for the wrong reasons as the movie unexpectedly has an over-saturation of comic relief which in turn hurts the film from being taken seriously at times. Good to see more risk taken to adding something new to the franchise however i felt more time focused on delivering compelling drama rather than squeezing in a extra couple gags would have propelled this film to one the best of all time.","true":true}
