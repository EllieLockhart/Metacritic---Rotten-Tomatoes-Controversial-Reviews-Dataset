Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a very anticlimactic movie that had too much comedy and missed opportunities for great storytelling.  Benecio DelToro's character was unneeded\\, Fin's love story was rushed with no chemistry\\,  the 2 big deaths made no sense\\,  Ray and Darth whoever's bond broke in a way that was disappointing\\, and there was an underlying theme of \\\"suicide is bad ass!\\\". Nobody has mentioned Yoda's weird muppet mouth. Why didn't anyone CGI that a bit? Just confused and disappointed. Rey still has had 0 minutes training making this Disney princess story even more confusing. Sad day for the force.","true":true}
