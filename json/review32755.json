Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi - The VIII episode has all it takes to be a blockbuster. There are some spectacular battle scenes that will blow your mind\\, surprising twists in the tale & emotional moments. It starts off from where 'The force awakens' ends. The characters Kylo Ren\\, Rey & Luke Skywalker offers good performances.\\n\\nAny hardcore fans dream come true I'd say.","true":true}
