The only reason I kept playing was just for gameplay and I still replay the combat encounters but that's about it. I don't care about Ellie being lesbian or the transgender story arc or anything like that. That's not my complaint with the game.

The only reason I kept playing was just for gameplay and I still replay the combat encounters but that's about it. I don't care about Ellie being lesbian or the transgender story arc or anything like that. That's not my complaint with the game. In fact I commend them for introducing these themes without shoving them down our throats like other games do.  However the fact that we have to watch a fan favorite character be brutally murdered and are forced to sympathize with the person who commited the act and forced to like the characters that are her friends makes ne hate this game. 8-10 hours of you're life are wasted playing as her. I don't xare about abby\\, or mel\\, or owen or anybody. I understand the message of revenge being bad but the execution was just awful. Red dead 2 has a better \\\"Revenge is bad\\\" story that was executed perfectly. The ending of the game left me vastly disappointed. How ellie throughout the course of the game murders and butchers through so many people and even kills dogs in brutal ways AND tortures a girl to death but as soon as she's about to kill the one person that caused her to lose so much she just suddenly can't. And people are trying to say that she regains her \\\"humanity\\\". Sorry no that's **** SHE KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE IN CRUEL AND BRUTAL WAYS. She lost all sense of humanity. It's just a waste of time\\, don't waste you're time on it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
