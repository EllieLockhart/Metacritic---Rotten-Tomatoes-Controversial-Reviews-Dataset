Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi Isn't exactly like the other movies in the franchise... moving away from the purists idea of what a Star Wars movie must be\\, and towards a direction of what it will become. If this franchise was going to stay relevant\\, the writing was going to adapt to a new generation. Was it the best written movie in the series\\, no. was it episode 1\\, 2 or 3... no. Don't read all the reviews that trash the movie. Star Wars will always be at minimum entertaining and an escape.","true":true}
