Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I knew the moment this movie finished that fans were going to freak out. \\nI waited a couple days before I wrote this review because I wanted the entire movie to sink into my head. This is a very good movie other than some comedic beats\\, that were a little bit misplaced\\, this film expanded my idea of what the force should be going forward with the Saga. The director's view has taken these movies in an entirely New Direction which I feel is necessary for it to grow as a continuing storyline. I think upon additional viewings of this movie \\,the fans that were upset will come to learn to love this film and realized what was trying to be accomplished.\\nThis film is great for young and old and for myself personally it has made Star Wars New Again. May the force be with us all.","true":true}
