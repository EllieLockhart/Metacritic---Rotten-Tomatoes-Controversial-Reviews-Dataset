Graphics and lighting are simply astonishing. Really detailed animations and enriched environments. But what I loved the most is the story.\rI am going to be honest\\, I was more excited about the gameplay because the story in the first one is just perfect and it is hard to make the second one better. But I am awestruck by how well written the story is. From almost the very beginning I saw that Ellie\/Joel are not that different from Abby. I did not fully see her as a villain. She did exactly what Joel did or what Ellie was trying to do. And playing as Abby (which I loved) enforced that feeling even more. My heart was broken when I saw Abby on that pillar. I was looking for a strong\\, powerful\\, and simply buff woman. And it hurt to see what Rattlers did to her.\rThe ending which I personally think starts with the theater fight and ends with the rolling credits left me a complete mess. I was crying for over an hour. I loved it. Yes\\, it was sad. But it does not make it bad. These are two different things. The ending and the whole story are very well written. And the fact that some of the events are sad does not make it bad. I cried when Joel was killed. But I cried when I had to fight dying Abby as well. The story leaves you with lots of different emotions and thoughts. And I loved every minute of it.\rI would like to thank the whole Naughty Dog team\\, the actors\\, and all other people who worked on this game. This is truly a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
