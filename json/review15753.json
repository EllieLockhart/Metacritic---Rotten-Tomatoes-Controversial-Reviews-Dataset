Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie! The way they suprice you in every scene and change your vision about some parts is amazing! The fights and the dialogs are intens and just pure genious I am happy that Rayan will be the director for the new troilogie after seeing this movie! It is my second favorite so far (nothing will beat Empire). but still this is a 9\\,5\/10 for me8","true":true}
