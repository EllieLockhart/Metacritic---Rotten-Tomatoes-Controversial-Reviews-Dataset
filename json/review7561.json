Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every plot point and misdirection is spelt out to the viewer. Half of this movie had no forward momentum\\, it was like watching a poorly written video game. Half of the major plot in this movie was meaningless\\, characters jump the shark or just go through full on character assassinations.\\n\\nThe only saving grace is that visually it's impressive and pretty\\, but a Star Wars movie this was not.\\n\\nDon't let this Director\/Writer touch the Star Wars universe ever again Disney.","true":true}
