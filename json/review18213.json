Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I Thought it was way better than TFA. Simply go see it. I loved it and I also enjoyed Rian Johnson's bold take of direction. \\n\\nWhat I think in pathetic is a group of people copy and paste posts over and over bad reviews. I went through about 50 pages of audience reviews and about 10 reviews I seen copied and pasted about 300 times. So we have a immature pouting handful of people grouping together to making about 9000 1\/2 star reviews or more by just creating a new email and posting over and over like a rebel faction against Disney or something. I get not liking something\\, but trying to sabotage\\, lol. That is pretty sad. All that wasted time. Go clean your room child! I mean your mommies basement that you been living in for the last 30 years.","true":true}
