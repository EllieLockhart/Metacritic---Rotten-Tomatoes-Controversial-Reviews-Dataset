Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The move had so much potential to be great but it is not. The Last Jedi is a very good Si-Fi action movie but it is an awfull Star Wars movie. Characters thrown away like Snoke or Luke Skywalker could have done so much more.","true":true}
