Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars the Last Jedi is the boldest and riskiest star wars films to date. As result we have gotten one of the most exhilarating cinema experiences of the last decade. Nothing I expected to happen happened leaving me in awe\\, I have seen many viewers disliking this movie as result of it subverting their own head cannon. But too me and I am sure many the risks this movie took really heighten it above other star wars movies. While the plot is somewhat lacklustre\\, this movie instead focuses on the characters letting Rey\\, Kylo and Luke shine. Additionally what allows this movie to have a leg up on other star wars movies is the sense of urgency felt throughout the movie (Besides the Rose and Finn Subplot which is definitely the worst part about the movie) you are truly on the edge of your seat throughout the movie unsure about who will make it through to  episode 9. While there are some weak moments there are many amazing moments throughout that definitely outweighs the weak. I cant forget to mention how gorgeous this movie looks\\, one of the many highlights of the movie is that it is a visual masterpiece.","true":true}
