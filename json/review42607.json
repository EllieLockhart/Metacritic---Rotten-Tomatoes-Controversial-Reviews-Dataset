Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awful! There were parts that made me feel embarrassed to be a fan. Cant really explain that but the Leia superman scene was so corny. I saw it last night and dont really remember any of it...thats how bad this movie was. Space horse races and what seemed like an hour and a half talking about fuel problems. Snoke just killed off and what they did to Luke! I hate it. Hate the movie. And the exact copy of the troops in the trench AT-AT scene from Empire was really confusing and lame.","true":true}
