Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could have understood many subversion plot points\\, social commentary and general defiance of audience expectations however\\, and I'll point only two of many questionable things on this movie. Giving forces ghosts the ability to act with the real world and using light speed as a weapon\\, this is not being a brilliant writer and subverting expectations\\, this is destroying the film's universe. Death no longer matters and space battles are useless.\\nPoints for the acting\\, cinematography and special effects they where all good. Overall terrible writing and execution from any objective point of vew it's  hard to believe that anyone actually think this is a good movie\\, I guess some people just need to believe it to be so.","true":true}
