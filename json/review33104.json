Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subverting expectations\\, how laughable! The plot is so haphazard it made me wish for ADD medication. The real world identity and class warfare politics of today are so \\\"in your face\\\" in this movie that it almost makes a mockery of them and it clearly shows that the writer \/ director in charge had no earthly idea what a real Star Wars movie is all about. The character assassination of Luke Skywalker is unforgivable (or should I call him Jake) and Mary Poppins Leia is quite a sight to behold...albeit not in a good way. Annnd...space ships running out of fuel\\, really\\, that's a thing now in Star Wars. So\\, we have aircraft carriers here on planet Earth that run on nuclear energy and don't have to stop for fuel\\, but a technologically advanced star ship needs to stop off at the nearest Exxon on occasion to fill up...what a joke. I'm not even going to get into other characters\\, especially those who are all powerful and die easily or those who are all powerful without having to do anything to gain that power. Enough has been said about them\\, as well as others who clearly don't belong or those who have no growth whatsoever from one movie to the other.\\n\\nWant to really subvert expectations \\\"Mr. Director\\\"\\, have Rey join the dark side and the First Order than have Luke hunt both her and Kylo down and end them. And since I could care less about ReyLo I would pay good money to see that happen. \\n\\nI actually enjoyed R1 and TFA\\, of course nostalgia had quite a bit to do with that I surmise (Vader in R1 and Han \/ Chewie \/ Falcon in TFA). I actually liked the characters in R1 quite a bit and enjoyed their journey of hope (not for them so much as the rest of the Rebellion of course). I liked the characters from TFA\\, that is until TLJ came out\\, now I could care less. So\\, does that make me a newfound racist\\, sexist and such since I despise this one with every ounce of my soul...I think not you flailing and screaming defenders of this so called Star Wars movie. Everyone has their own taste when it comes to movies\\, music\\, books and such...if you liked this movie good for you\\, but because I don't please don't troll me as something Im not...you only belittle yourself when you do that. \\n\\nAnd\\, Disney\\, don't expect anymore of my money when it comes to your Star Wars universe. It's not the one I and many others grew up with\\, it's kind of a bizarro Star Wars universe where you can become a master Jedi by wishing it so; where all men are either evil\\, morons or useful idiots; where droids are superheroes (looking at you BB8) and not support staff; where fuel is needed for technologically advanced space ships; where hyperspace ramming is a viable option; where Rose gets her way (Star Love...not Wars) annnd where side trips to casino planets to free captured animals is great and wonderful\\, but leaving the slave kids is A-Ok\\, pffffft.... Thanks\\, but no thanks!","true":true}
