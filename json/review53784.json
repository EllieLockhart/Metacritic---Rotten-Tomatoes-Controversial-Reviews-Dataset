Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great set up from Force Awakens absolutely ruined\\, key questions from first film unanswered and more disappointingly don't even matter anymore\\, good sense of humour used earlier in film belittles antagonists towards the end\\, I'm surprised it all went so wrong\\, all they had to do was ask any star wars fan what they might want to see in this film and they would have realised they were going to disappoint. Left this movie not really caring what happens in the next one\\, I'm guessing it all turns out fine. The more I think about it\\, the more it upsets me.","true":true}
