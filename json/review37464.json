Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many plot holes and plot convenience and political messages its just annoying. If Yoda can control lighting why doesn't he help anyone out? The more I think about the new trilogy the annoyed I'd get and hate these movies.","true":true}
