Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi straddles the seemingly impossible position of being either extremely flawed storytelling or a stroke of artistic genius. Adhering doggedly to its central theme of failure\\, it is comprised of a slow moving main plot and entirely inconsequential B plots while relying heavily on the poor decision making of its central cast and supporting characters to advance the story. Thus the work is strangely self aware reflecting either the genius or  failure of Director Rian Johnson's vision.","true":true}
