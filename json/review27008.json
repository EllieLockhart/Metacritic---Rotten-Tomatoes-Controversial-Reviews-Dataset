Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies. Kylo Ren is now one of the most dynamic villains with a compelling character arc. Luke returns and takes his place in my heart as one of the best Star Wars heroes. Luke has a great redemption arc and has a sad backstory that is shared with Kylo. This movie is shot beautifully and has one of my scenes in Star Wars. The movie also brings up a interesting way to use hyperspace.","true":true}
