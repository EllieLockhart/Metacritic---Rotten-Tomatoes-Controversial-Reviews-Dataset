Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A ridiculously bad story and terrible character development.  Ultimately director RJ doesn't really understand the genre that Star Wars grew up from\\, instead projecting a 2017 Guardians of the Galaxy vibe which doesn't fit.  Absolutely stupid casino scene\\, the escape riding on eco dinosaurs while the rebellion is hours from destruction (Finn..I love this place).  Almost makes you wonder if film was reordered after shooting.  But the worst thing by far is Jedi skills appearing that there were absolutely no hints norr relevance\\n in the prior 9movies.Teleporting or broadcasting images of yourself galaxies away or flying through the air while dead?  Give me a break.","true":true}
