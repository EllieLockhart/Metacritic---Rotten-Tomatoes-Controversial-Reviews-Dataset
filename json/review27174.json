Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst star waras movie I have seem. There are stories that don't give anything to the movie. What they do with Luke Skywalker is terrific. And the history is full of incoherences.","true":true}
