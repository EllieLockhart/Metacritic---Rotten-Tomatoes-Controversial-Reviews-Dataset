Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were so many problems with this movie from top to bottom.  In reading the positive reviews\\, I'm not sure we were watching the same movies.  I watched this at home\\, which may have missed out on the experience.  Poor character development\\, nonsensical plot\\, mediocre CGI (especially the stills)\\, and none of the choreography and music that Star Wars has been known to do well.","true":true}
