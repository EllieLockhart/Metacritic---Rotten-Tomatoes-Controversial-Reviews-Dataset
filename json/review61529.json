Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Game is really good\\, but i still hate SJW part here.\rI actually managed to complete the game before release so i had time to prepare this short review\\, sorry for bad eng tho. To be short stealth mechanics are still the same and didn't developed throughout the years.  You still can feel the tension thought. Shootings part are as great as ever and worth buying game already\\, you can feelGame is really good\\, but i still hate SJW part here.\rI actually managed to complete the game before release so i had time to prepare this short review\\, sorry for bad eng tho. To be short stealth mechanics are still the same and didn't developed throughout the years.  You still can feel the tension thought. Shootings part are as great as ever and worth buying game already\\, you can feel every weapon from pulling revolver trigger to hitting enemies with foam. But to get to the interesting part\\, yes\\, there is a lot of political correctness in the game. There is a lot about  women are stronger and better than men in everything\\, and the only community in the game where a man is ruled (suddenly) are fascists. This story is about a cycle of violence\\, an obsession with revenge\\, a good story.  The heroes are interesting in the second part\\, I don't argue.  But even a few of these political correctness and radical femenism in the game is a spoonful of dirt in a barrel of honey. The way white men are presented with chauvinist and biggots scum and women have all the power. In the end\\, i would still recommend the game\\, but its defenetly not a masterpiece and not as good as 1 part. Please dont hate the company and its workers but Niel Drakman and his radical femenism friends ( you know who i am talking about). In the end the only way to show them that this is wrong is by reviews.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
