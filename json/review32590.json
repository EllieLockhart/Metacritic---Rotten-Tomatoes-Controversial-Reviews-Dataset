Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a Disney movie combined with bad video game side missions.  There were moments I loved.  However\\, there were far more moments that I could not accept. We learned nothing about Snoke\\, Luke was denied a hero's death in true combat\\, and the plot holes are too numerous to mention.  I did appreciate Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ripley\\, Andy Serkis\\, and the late Carrie Fisher. I thought they did incredible work with the weak script and lack of directorial vision they received.   So\\, the challenge is issued to the next generation of force users.  Somewhere\\, Walt Disney's cryogenically frozen head is trying to rule the galaxy.  It is up to you to stop him.","true":true}
