Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WORST Starwars movie to date infact this one takes the cake\\, not only is it a bad star wars movie (i wouldn't even call it a starwars movie because this is more of a marvel superheroes in space movie THIS IS NOT STARWARS)  but this is a bad movie period.   disappointing af\\, don't go unless you want starwars and the memory of all its cherished characters & their damaged beyond all recognition.\\n\\nI for one will be be going forward forgetting about Disneys franchise starwars and only consider the first Trilogy\\, the prequels\\, and Timothy Zahn books as cannon. Disney can eff right off with this gawdawful dissapointment","true":true}
