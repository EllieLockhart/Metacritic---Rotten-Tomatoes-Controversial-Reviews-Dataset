Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just awful. I guess the plus side is that it makes the prequels look good in comparison. Can we get a reboot and just ignore FA and this? They could be a dream by JarJar Binks -we'd be fine with that!","true":true}
