Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had hopes that Rian Johnson was going to be the one to make a great Star Wars movie since Disney acquired the franchise. I did not like The Force Awakens. Rogue One was a vast improvement\\, and I hoped the Force Awakens was just a bad start. I was vaguely familiar with Rian Johnson for his work on Breaking Bad\\, and in particular\\, one of my favorite episodes\\, \\\"Ozymandius\\\". I had no idea The Last Jedi was going to be so bad. It appears to be an intentional sucker punch to the fans of the original trilogy. I'm not sure why Disney would buy this franchise with a huge fan base\\, only to intentionally push those fans away and create some new fan base. Well\\, mission accomplished. I'm done. Good luck replacing the fans. Spoiler: You wont.","true":true}
