Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A visually breathtaking film with some ups\\, but far too many downs to make it an enjoyable viewings experience. to any traditional star wars fan it's a clunky far cry from what makes it's predecessors so great. Star wars done wrong","true":true}
