Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even JarJar Binks would be ashamed of this train wreck. \\n\\nAs a along time fan of the franchise\\, I am disappointed to see the turn the series has taken. This movie destroys any good qualities to be found in a Star Wars movies. It is saturated with mundane\\, forcibly \\\"quirky\\\" characters\\, quips which ruin every emotional event\\, universe inconsistencies that would have seriously altered the plot of the movie if taken into account\\, and needless pandering to the audience. Some might say these criticisms are ill founded and too harsh\\, but theyre not. This movie is a prime example of milking a franchise beyond its longevity and demonstrates exactly what is wrong with pop-cinema and the exploitation of audiences.","true":true}
