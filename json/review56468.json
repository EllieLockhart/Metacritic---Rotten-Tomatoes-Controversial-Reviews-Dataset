Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film constantly reminds me to let the past die while offering me nothing better in return. It feels like a purposely contrarian film\\, full of \u201csubversive\u201d things just for the sake of it. The film does nothing to expound upon anything introduced in The Force Awakens while simultaneously disrespecting the original trilogy\u2019s characters. The tone is so unbalanced and the forced humor is misplaced and undercutting. Plot holes in abundance as well as huge details that flip everything we knew about Star Wars on its head - not in a positive way. Having said this - there are positives. There\u2019s a few very touching sequences between characters and some really neat action sequences. The cinematography is gorgeous and it\u2019s nice they\u2019re continuing to utilize as much in the way of hand built sets\\, puppets\\, animatronics\\, and practical effects as possible. John Williams also does a good job with the film\\, but I wasn\u2019t left remembering any new pieces of music that will become iconic. I really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do with Episode 9\\, but part of me is honestly apathetic now because of what this film made me feel. We\u2019ll see\\, in time\\, I guess.
