Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had some flaws\\, but the audience who have given this a half a star are jaded and honestly have lost all credibility. I\u2019d give this and 89%\\, which out of five stars\\, equates to 4.5. Is this the best Star Wars? No. Is The Last Jedi as bad as the Phantom Menace? Absolutely not!!! Are you kidding me? The Star Wars \u201cfans\u201d saying that it\u2019s as bad as The Phantom Menace probably also think Captain Kirk is their favorite Star Wars character.","true":true}
