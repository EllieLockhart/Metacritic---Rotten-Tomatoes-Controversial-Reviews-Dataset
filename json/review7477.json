Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even though this movie was far from perfect and there\u2019s more than a few things I would have done differently\\, it was more than an entertaining installment in the Star Wars Saga....where the Force Awakens played it safe\\, the Last Jedi took risks...some great\\, some not so much. The movie could have also been about a half hour shorter..... Saw it again today and it added some clarity... I really thought it was great the second time around. Us Star Wars fans can go into these movies with almost unreasonable expectations hoping to get the next Empire and it\u2019ll never happen.","true":true}
