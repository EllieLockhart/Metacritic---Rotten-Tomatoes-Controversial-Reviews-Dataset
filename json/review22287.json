Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi and rogue one is exactly what i\\, a long time fan\\, wanted to see with the Star Wars Fran chose franchise. Too many times have the films played it safe and being too much like one another\\, expanding on nothing. Every scene was fresh\\, and full of action wether it's love or lightsabers\\, it kept me glued to the screen. If you want nostalgia\\, go watch the old films. If you want something new\\, start here.","true":true}
