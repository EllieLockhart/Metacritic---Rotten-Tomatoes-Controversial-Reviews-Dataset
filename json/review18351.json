Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a very good movie however i think the plotholes didn't help. I also think that Snoke died off too quickly because he should've been this strong unbeatable guy who could take on anyone with ease.","true":true}
