Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great\\, daring\\, unique installment in the saga\\, bound to grow in the public's mind until it is recognized as the awesome film it is. The most complex\\, the most stunning\\, the best acted\\, and one of the four Episodes that in any way changed some aspect of American cinema.\\nAnd it fits in the whole saga extremely well\\, improves the prequels and it's also the perfect open-ended conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.","true":true}
