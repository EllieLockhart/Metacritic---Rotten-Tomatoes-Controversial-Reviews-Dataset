Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most daring and different of the Star Wars films since the Disney buy out and the only one to try and take the story in a new direction. Not a remake like The Force Awakens nor a safe\\, nostalgia love letter like Rogue One\\, The Last Jedi takes chances in its character beats and story telling. It\u00e2(TM)s not perfect - it drags a little in the mid-section but it\u00e2(TM)s the most challenging Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.","true":true}
