Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has been a part of my life since I was a small boy. Luke's battle with growing up an orphan and then becoming a Jedi then saving his father was beautiful . They way 40 years of Luke material was wiped away hurts. Luke deserves to go out in a way Vader was introduced in rouge one. I had such high hopes when Rey found Luke on the island to end \\\"s the force awakens \\\". He had a look of determination and I think fans like myself where waiting for his return as the universes last and all powerful Jedi. To degrade Luke and more importantly Mark Hamil is  just another example of rich Hollywood executives ignoring the fans that built there million dollar empires.","true":true}
