Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ brings us the first \\\"Your mama\\\" joke of the franchise in the opening scene where Poe arrogantly trolls the Star Destroyer.  He's never scared\\, there is no tension\\, it's just boring scene after boring scene of these empty characters doing something goofy like they are in a comedic parody of Star Wars.  This is why the movie is so idiotic and a disgrace to the franchise.  For me\\, this movie was \\\"The Last Straw\\\".  I'm officially done with Star Wars for good.  The damage to the brand is beyond repair at this point.  The 90% rating from the professional critics is highly suspicious.  The problems with this movie are so frequent and obvious that everyone else is able to see yet completely ignored by every critic.","true":true}
