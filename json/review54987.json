Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was disappointing. Having said that\\, it was at least entertaining. If this were not Star Wars I would give it 3 stars as a kids action movie with some eye candy and a don\u2019t abuse animals and rich people are evil message. Because it is Star Wars I expected more. I found the story to be poor and the telling of it to be poor\\, the writing also felt... bumpy...as if they were trying to tip their hats to the prequels in bad way. At times it felt as if the movie was all over the place\\, not really knowing what it wanted to do. \u201cAm I a political message board or a kids action movie?... or maybe I\u2019m a Star Wars movie?\u201d The humor\\, though funny\\, was horribly misplaced at times and overused to an extreme. It had a few redeeming moments. However\\, redeeming moments are not what I expect from a Star Wars movie. This Star Wars movie told a bad story in a bad way and had some action. The direction the movie seemed to be going at the end was interesting enough\\, but the journey to get there and the way it was told was questionable at best. ","true":true}
