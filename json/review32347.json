Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Starwars is a great movie. If you're a fan its incredible. If you're going in with high expectations that it will follow \\\"the formula\\\" of the other films then you will be probably lean more towards the critical side. I personally loved the movie. It does manage to subvert expectations constantly while adding humor and countless easter eggs. The film has it's flaws but nothing deserving the audience score on this website. If you trust that 49%\\, then you should probably take a look at power rangers (2017). I know the sample sizes are different but it sort of proves audiences who go into huge films like this have torches lit. While people who go into films without high expectations leave and give it 5 stars.","true":true}
