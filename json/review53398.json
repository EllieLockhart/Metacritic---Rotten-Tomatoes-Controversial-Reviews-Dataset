Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. I get trying to subvert audience expectations however this film betrays the lore established in the the media before it. Nothing seems right. This movie holds no balance in an already established saga. This seems like a pet project of the director\/writer's than an actual installment to a series. So many question ignored\\, so many expectations shattered and in a way that just cripples the story. So many elements unnecessarily added for no actual benefit at all.","true":true}
