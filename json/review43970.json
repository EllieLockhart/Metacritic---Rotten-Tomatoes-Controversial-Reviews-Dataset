Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thousands of user reviews already state what is wrong with this film. Here's my list\\, in order of most important to least important:\\n1. No character arcs - characters are flat and unidimensional. The only one that shows signs of growing is Finn\\, but that's after he went back to being a coward\\, after TFA.\\n2. Humor - seriously\\, classic Star Wars have their comic moments\\, but this is by no means a Marvel type flick. Constant bathos in this movie just makes the whole thing look stupid and devoid of meaning. Even moments that should be serious and dark are filled with silly jokes.\\n3. Plot holes galore - so many it's hard to remember all of them. From the now infamous canto bight story line that turned out to be entirely inconsequential\\, to captain phasma being raised from the dead\\, Finn regressing to a coward for no reason\\, or even the first order now somehow dominating the entire galaxy just a few minutes after destroying a few planets in TFA - what's going on in this universe??\\n4. Absolutely atrocious \\\"plot twists\\\". Sure\\, let's kill snoke\\, but can you at least provide some background on the guy\\, and give him a dramatic death? What about admiral holdo\\, who the movie portraits as a bitch of a leader\\, only to later reveal she was somehow \\\"right\\\" and insta-redeem her for holding back critical information?\\n5. Breaking hyperspace - honestly\\, in any SW battle both future and past\\, just hyperspace one of your ships into the enemy. Huge cruisers and star destroyers are now the most vulnerable spaceships in the SW universe\\, well done.\\n6. First SW movie I only watched once\\, and have no intention of watching again. That's something I never thought I would experience in my lifetime.\\n7. Many\\, many other issues\\n\\nFor all of the above and more\\, I consider TLJ a horrible movie\\, star wars or not.","true":true}
