Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing! Dazzling effects and cgi making the space battles and fights enjoyable. Lack of character development and background story from snoke and Rey. Pointless scenes including the casino. Reinvention of 'the force' with Leia scene\\, kylo and Rey communication and lukes abilities. Overall a confusing and unsatisfactory plot  for the star wars series but an alright film.","true":true}
