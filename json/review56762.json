Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn't bad but it was wasn't great either. I don't understand where Johnson was going with this. Before it came out I thought they would want to show us something new like a \\\"Gray Jedi\\\" concept (Force user being in between the light and the dark) but at the end Kylo was just another Sith and Rey was just another Jedi even though they layed out the concept a little bit at the beginning. Why was the main villain (Snoke) \\\"killed\\\" so easily in the middle of  the second episode? He was playing with Rey like she was nothing and shown us some crazy force strength. I'd rather not talk about what they did with Luke Skywalker and the whole Island thing because I'm still not sure if I want to puke or cry. Probably both... These are just a few examples of what I was disappointed with. What I liked most in this movie was how Leia finally used some of that Anakin Skywalker bloodline in her and survived the blast using the force. Good luck with episode IX J.J. Abrams.","true":true}
