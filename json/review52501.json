Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible film to a once great franchise. Those people who are Star Wars fan can only like this movie if they've never read a Star Wars book or no nothing other than the movies. So many great stories to pull from to end up. With this shit show of a movie. Disney will not get another dime from me on the Star Wars front. It was a sad day for me coming out of the theater after that hatchet job of a movie. That was not the Luke Skywalker of the RTJ. A man who believed his father could be saved after all he had done\\, but gives into dispare for a nephew! What did Han exactly die for?","true":true}
