Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best movie in the entire franchise\\, and the first one that made me care about the series. Since I have no childhood nostalgia about the original trilogy (watched all the movies first time in 2015)\\, I can say that this was the most fun and entertaining movie out of all 8 of them. I don't really care for the fanservice that was in 7\\, so this was finally something anyone could enjoy.","true":true}
