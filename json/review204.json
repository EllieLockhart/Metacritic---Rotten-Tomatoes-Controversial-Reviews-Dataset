As I continued playing though the game ramped up quickly and the protagonists Kiryu and Majima really started to become fleshed out.\r\rI'm not even sure how to explain this game.

There is so much to do in Yakuza 0 and everything for the most part is fun from doing the main story to playing baseball or sharing your phone card collection as you come the street for all the hidden ones to oh so much more. I would do a chapter and then hit up mini games to break of the seriousness of the main story which gets ridiculously  good quite quickly and becomes one of the most amazing crime dramas I have ever seen!\r\rFrom a game that started off as unsure why everyone loved so much to becoming one of my favorite games speaks volumes to this series. This game made me a fan for life and I have the long journey of obtaining the rest of the series to see how everything turns out.\r\rI love this game\\, and I love you Kiiiiiryu-Chan!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
