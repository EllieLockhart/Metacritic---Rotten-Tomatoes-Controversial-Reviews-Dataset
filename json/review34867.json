Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that this movie has lower user score than episode I and episode II means there\u2019s something seriously wrong with humanity. This movie was really good! Yes\\, there\u2019s a lot of slow sections and yes\\, some of the characters didnt need to be in this movie\\, like the Asian chick who was going around with Finn. If you look past these flaws though\\, you will find that it\u2019s a really enjoyable (although flawed) feature.","true":true}
