Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good continuation of the saga. Some unexpected twists kept it from being boring. The pacing dragged very slightly in spots\\, but most of the time the story was engaging. Some details seemed a little off (the bombs dropping\\, for example) but that was a minor distraction. Felt less like a middle-of-the-story film\\, but still leaves the viewer looking forward to more.","true":true}
