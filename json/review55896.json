Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson had everything set up for him by JJ Abrams. TFA was a widely accepted reboot to Star Wars that introduced some new interesting characters while playing it safe with using similar plot structures. Rian Johnson was NOT qualified to direct this movie. It's a real shame when a trilogy is ruined due to one director trying to be bold rips up everything he was given. The awful Finn and Rose subplot was not even as upsetting to me as the way Snoke and Luke were handled.\\n\\nI wont retread everything that the thousands of other negative reviews have said\\, but as I Star Wars fan I need to add my .5 star rating to the pot. \\n\\nIt is like Rian Johnson was given this awesome looking Kylo Ren helmet from JJ that was on its way to becoming an icon for Star Wars and said\\, 'nah!' and smashed it into pieces.\\n\\nCould not be more disappointed with this movie.","true":true}
