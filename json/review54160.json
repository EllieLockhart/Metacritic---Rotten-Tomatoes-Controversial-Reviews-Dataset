Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt so bleak and drained after walking out of the theatre it took me a day to recover.\\n\\nIf you are to take this movie into the continuity of the original franchise\\, it would mean all the movies prior accomplished nothing.\\n\\nThe TFA did a poor job of explaining how the First Order came to reign after the demise of the old empire and TLJ does not expand on this in any meaningful way. In fact the movie continually deprives the audience of any events that could impact the outcome\\, essentially painting doom and gloom everywhere. All the while tearjerking the viewer into thinking something of consequence would occur. All the joy and high hopes we have for our heroes from the end of ROTJ are decimated in front of us. The future is shit\\, the new stewardship tells us.\\n\\nIt appears the writers want to clear way for a new franchise and characters but in fear of us rejecting them have decided to undo everything the original trilogy and characters stood for\\, by destroying them in front of us before literally killing them off. Why? Why can't you create a new conflict in an existing universe and leave the well-told and ended original story be?\\n\\nI have a feeling this has to do with the winds of politics in the USA today. It's just sad to see that Star Wars is being used to sell us political propaganda. It is very obvious\\, even cringeworthy at times. The original cast was signed on when they thought George Lucas was at the helm\\, prior to the Disney-sellout. At least Mark Hamill has been fairly open about how he feels\\, looking at the interviews.\\n\\nEven the flawed (in telling\\, not in story) prequels seem like happy memories now. I wish I had never seen this\\, and will not be giving Disney another dime until they release the original theatrical versions of episodes 4\\, 5 and 6 in hi-def\\, properly restored\\, AND without any material associated with what came after whatsoever.","true":true}
