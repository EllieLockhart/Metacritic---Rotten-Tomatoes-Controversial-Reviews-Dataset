Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie!!! Everything about it was great!!! Don't let all of the older nerds turn you away from this one with there bad reviews. Go see it now!!!","true":true}
