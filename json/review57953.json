Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What... The... Hell?!\\n\\nNobody wanted to like a Star Wars movie more than I did. I really enjoyed Force Awakens and Rogue One. Was so happy Disney acquired the rights and indicated that they had this under control... then\\, they release Last Jedi.\\n\\nThis movie has good camera work\\, editing and effects. Everything else is a total mess. Awful characters\\, pathetic humor\\, a ridiculous social commentary made on the Space Vegas planet\\, a disastrous Luke character\\, no cool force training for Rey\\, a pathetic and unsatisfying answer about her lineage\\, and the entire plot literally revolving around not fueling up the spaceships adequately .\\n\\nI'm so completely disappointed with this movie\\, I'm seriously considering returning my kids Star Wars Christmas gift Legos.","true":true}
