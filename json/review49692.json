{"101487":199520,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-07","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what can be said.  The worst Star Wars movie ever.  Worse than the prequels.  I am in agreement with most all the massive backlash criticisms\\, there are so many things wrong with this film there is not enough space in one post to list them.  \\n\\n1. Plot holes\\, plot holes\\, plot holes.  Most everything does not make basic logical sense.  For example\\, how do you drop bombs in space?  These slow moving bombers were all taken out\\, all but one\\, yet this lone bomber survives with hundreds of tie fighters buzzing about in the meantime this woman tries kick down a remote control??  And when the resistance jumps to light speed to escape the convoy then comes out of light speed ... why do they exit light speed in the middle of space?  Why not just zip right up to the planet and new found fortress like all other Star Wars movies do in hyperspace travel?   This movie is completely insulting to your intelligence and is written by an complete and utter imbecile.\\n\\n2. Leia Poppins.... no need to say more\\, you can read all about it.\\n\\n3. What they heck did they do to Luke\\, Mark Hamill tried to warn us that they screwed Luke over.  Nothing from this movie projects the character that matches what you would expect from Luke Skywalker and this is unforgivable.  Luke's character deserved better\\, way better ... this one thing is what makes it feel like the write\/director\/producer utterly took a dump on the whole franchise.\\n\\n4.  Character development is non-existent.  Rey is the same at the beginning as she was at the end... we learn nothing new about her\\, we see no conflict we did not already see in Force Awakens\\, nothing resolve no growth\\, no training yet she can master the Force and best all the male force masters without any lessons.  She is perfect in anything she does -- she can fix the falcon\\, she can beat Kylo Ren (first try\\, despite never having used a light saber before)\\, she can out fly two tie fighters (I know all this comes from Force Awakens but is further amplified in this pile of horse dung movie).  Finn is still the same coward\\, run away deserter yet\\, and shows only a slight glimmer bravery.  Poe is portrayed as a hot headed idiot\\, Snoke (arguably the coolest most mysterious character in the new trilogy) was simply killed off .... no background\\, no explanation of his motivations or where he came from.  \\n\\n5. The forced\\, humor. OMG -- almost every scene building to what looks like will be a great moment (though there are no great moments in this movie) is ruined by a bad joke.  The opening scene set this tone.  The original trilogy had humorous moments but those were witty and did not deflate the tension\\, this movie... well\\, just plane STUPID.  Hated every joke. \\n\\n6. The political message is shoved in your face\\, you can't escape it.  Every character interaction\\, heck one entire subplot line is dedicated to purported \\\"evils of capitalism\\\".  This movie embodies the most recent Huff Post tweet that \\\"Kill all white men\\\".\\n\\nAnd the list goes on .....\\n\\nPURE TRASH\\n\\nThanks Disney\\, you will never see me pay the price of admission for another Star Wars movie.  You have ruined the franchise\\, a phenomena that at its core integrated into and become defining of American culture and has now been thrown in the garbage -- just what the liberal left wanted -- destroy the American culture to make way for the new order of diversification free of white men's ugly capitalism.","true":true}
