The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Gameplay: The gameplay in the last of us part 2 is brutal\\, dirty and feels like you're fighting for you're life in every encounter. The AI is incredibly smart and can plan coordinated attacks on you as well as outflank you\\, when I was playing on survivor mode I felt forced to play aggressive as if I stayed in one spot enemies would quickly surround you. It is an immersive experience because of these mechanics as well as the horrific screams when you dismember an enemy or the cries of anger when you kill one of their friends. I recommend playing on survivor. 10\/10\r\rGraphics; Absolutely stellar\\, jaw dropping\\, and at times almost feels photorealistic. 10\/10\r\rStory: This aspect of the game is the most polarizing and controversial\\, and is the main reason of the negative reviews. The point of the game is not merely revenge is bad\\, as many players say it is\\, I'd like it to compare it too the final scene in \\\"Come and See\\\". In which the main character fueled by hate comes to understand that we are all victims of our environment\\, Abby is not inherently evil\\, the world she lives in forced her to be evil to survive\\, just like has happened in Ellies and Joels storylines\\, but as we play with Abby we see that she is not simply Joels killer\\, she is also a daughter to a murdered father\\, friend\\, lover and just as human as Ellie\\, she is a good person which had to make bad decisions. In other words its not the people who are evil it is the world they live in that turns evil into a virtue\\, almost a condition for surviving. When I understood this it was easier to slowly forgive Abby as each time we played as here we were seeing another layer of her\\, and by the end I actually enjoyed playing as Abby more than I enjoyed playing as Ellie. Whether you liked the game or not comes down to if you could forgive Abby or not\\, you're in the same boat as Ellie\\, so thats why I think whether to spare Abby or not should be up to the players\\, and not determined by the game\\, simply because a lot pop people could not forgive Abby\\, in my case I did and the decision Ellie made was coherent with my own\\, but a lot of people wanted Abby dead and just had to see their character forgive them. So in conclusion the story is a masterpiece if you can slowly forgive Abby thought the game. But naughty dog should have allowed you to decide. 8\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
