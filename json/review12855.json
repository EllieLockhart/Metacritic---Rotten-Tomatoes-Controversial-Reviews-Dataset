Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't have a Rotten Tomatoes account until I saw this film\\, but after seeing it today I needed to join the online debate about the film.\\n\\nI am so\\, so disappointed\\, angry\\, frustrated and upset - emotions that I have never left a cinema feeling. As a child of the 70s\\, I grew up watching Star Wars\\, with awe and dreams of being Luke Skywalker\\, or maybe becoming a Jedi like him. Forty years later\\, I'm still a fan\\, and now feel pretty heart broken after someone's 'vision' of the Skywalker story.\\n\\nOverall\\, I enjoyed the film\\, even though there were plot gaps\\, story abbreviations and lack of some characters. However\\, the ending (I'm trying not to give spoilers\\, but if you've seen the film\\, you know exactly what I'm referring to) ruins this film for me. It was completely unnecessary\\, and has made me not want to watch anything Star Wars again\\,. My childhood hero\\, and dream\\, and been ruined. It's like killing off Batman in the middle of a Batman movie. Wth Rian??  Luke skywalker IS Star Wars\\, and the only character most of us truly care about.","true":true}
