Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worth seeing\\, the only issue with the film is the strange side plot with Fin and Po. It seemed more like a setup for the next movie\\, we pray a pay-off. The main plot was amazing\\, the twist where kinda cool with burning in the face of theorist but it is what it is and it was amazing!","true":true}
