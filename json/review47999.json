Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While \\nNow let me be honest here. I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. The style of it was fresh and new - comedy was a lot more prevalent and the dramatic tension and release of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. But then\\, come the third act\\, everything fell apart. Characters felt shoehorned into positions\\, little or no payoff was given for what the first and second acts had set up and most importantly\\, there was little to no emotional involvement in what should have been a triumphant final clash. \\n\\nOverall The Last Jedi is a disappointment. Not compared to the hype that was generated for it\\, not compared to the fan theories or speculation but a disappointment to the actual plot of the movie itself. \\nYou see\\, The Last Jedi not only throws away many of the intriguing plot points of the first movie but actually throws away most of it's own. Characters are wasted left right and centre and entire storylines are left unresolved\\, leaving the movie feeling directionless.\\nBut worse than just feeling directionless\\, the movie seems to go out of its way to set up interesting and emotionally investing storylines and then takes the most bland and unfulfilling route.\\n\\nThe characters of Admiral Holdo\\, Hux\\, Phasma and DJ (who is actually unnamed in the film itself) are all most unfortunately wasted. Rose is fridged halfway through the third act and Poe's entire plotline with Holdo felt useless\\, making her sacrifice feel hollow.\\nRose and Finn's storyline was ultimately useless\\, which would have been a fantastic reversal of expectations had the film not spent almost an hour and a half on the plotline\\, making it feel simply like a waste of time. \\n\\nAnd the kiss between Rose and Finn felt forced (pardon the pun) and uncomfortably like hero worship. It had very little buildup\\, despite the large amount of screen time the characters spent together and can be best described through the words of a random cinemagoer behind me at the showing: \\\"Oh\\, well I guess they did spend most of the movie together.\\\"\\nThere was a ton of chemistry between the characters but none of it really felt romantic. Even if it had felt romantic\\, that relationship was given no room to be explored in the remaining twenty minutes of the movie due to Rose's removal from the narrative a la convenient but recoverable head wound. \\nBut worst of all\\, this turn in the story really cheapened the extremely emotional reunion of Rey and Finn not ten minutes later\\, where it is impossible to not read romantic chemistry and affection. \\n\\nNow don't even get me started on Luke refusing his call to action for almost two hours of the movie and how it cheapens both his character and his plotline in the movie. \\nAparently Daisy Ridley cried \\\"tears of joy\\\" when she heard that JJ Abrams is coming back for episode 9. Now\\, I think we know why.\\n\\nEpisode 8 was enjoyable\\, but it was ultimately a narrative mess and I am unlikely to re-watch it.","true":true}
