Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe that I didn't like this.  If you'd asked me just two days ago\\, I would have told you that you could roll a rotten grapefruit out and make some vague BB-8 sounds and I would have sat my brown butt down and watched that rotten grapefruit like it was Citizen Kane.\\n\\nThe various storylines were just nonsensical and I couldn't bring myself to care about anything.  None of the questions from The force Awakens were answered (or at least not in a remotely satisfying way).\\n\\nGrumpy Luke\\, confused Rey\\, surprise force ghost....it was really hard to mess this movie up\\, yet somehow they managed to do it spectacularly.","true":true}
