Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Welp I gotta say I went in with low expectations and was still disappointed. The movie basically undid all of the original movies. That's it. It didn't add much to the current storyline and focused more on stuff it could use to sell toys rather than sell the franchise.","true":true}
