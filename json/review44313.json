Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many negatives to make this a great Star Wars movie.  Needless subplot involving Finn\\, terrible comedy moments\\, Domhal Gleeson reduced to a panto villain\\, pointless cameos from beloved original trilogy\\, Porgs existed for toy sales only\\, and character set ups from the Force Awakens go nowhere.\\n\\nVery sad for me to be saying this.","true":true}
