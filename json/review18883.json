Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a shame that this movie presents a waste of character story.  So many possibilities of twists like a possible FO spy or\\, as Force Awakens points to\\, the force leading the destinies of the Skywalker line.  Even an epic end to the hero of the previous films.  But no\\, instead sloppy messages of entitled people getting rich off the poor and what seems more like a soda commercial at the end is what is presented rather than a hopeful next step.  The bad plot & writing is the Jar Jar of episode 8.\\nAnd the blue milk.  Ugh.","true":true}
