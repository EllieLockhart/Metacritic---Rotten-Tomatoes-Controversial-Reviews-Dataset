Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely cheesy film\\, with too many plot holes. Rose's and Finn's story was pointless\\, we will never know who Snoke really was or how he came to power\\, where does the First Order come from\\, what happened to the jedi students that followed Kylo Ren?... I can go on and on... The only thing that saves this movie are the special effects. Oh\\, and one last thing\\, what was up with that ending? It was literally kids playing with Star Wars characters pretending to be Jedi.  Some may say that it shows \\\"the next generation of Jedi\\,\\\" but to me it was a marketing scene in order to market Star Wars toys to kids... typical of Disney.","true":true}
