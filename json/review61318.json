But it will likely disappoint you.\r\rEvery single thing about the game is masterfully executed other than the narrative and writing.\rThe art\\, programming\\, animation\\, visual effects\\, lighting\\, music\\, ambience\\, atmosphere\\, world building\\, etc. All God tier!!!\rThere's an amazing template here that has the potential to house really great story's.\rLike the original last of us.\rBut unfortunately There's this weird political meta narrative that makes it very difficult to get immersed in the game.\rIts very heavy handed and it's very preachy. Especially visually.\rI am a member of the LGBT community. I'm a liberal and I love diversity in all aspects of life.\rSo when I say I don't like the characters in this game its 100% not coming from a place of hate or ignorance. I feel like the game is perpetuating negative stereotypes. The way some characters look and act is pure cringe. They don't feel like real people and they don't feel like video game characters. Your expectations will be subverted. But in the worst possible way. 6\/10\r\rBigot Sandwich < Jill Sandwich\u2026 Expand","true":true}
