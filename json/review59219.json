Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Masterpiece easily a 9 but its design\\, graphics and details such as the fuel canister its nozzle protrudes from the backpack raises it to 10;  impressive what was achieved with a PS4.  Incredible story but difficult to understand without paying attention;  considering that Joel's death is very fast during the plot but understandable because it would lengthen the game even more unnecessarily\\, it should be noted that his death was basically in the style of deaths within the universe of The last Us also that it was the only way to continue with the  story since part 1 was very finished and I do not see the way that Joel becomes a super hero again in another repetitive way;  the story starts very slowly it feels heavy but once it ends it starts what is a series of murders with cruelty this throughout the game;  the detail that the npc have names is something that impresses and even more so with the motion capture of the deaths;  The script is very well done but you have to pay attention to understand it with knowing that your actions have a reaction and thus the game deceives you\\, thinking of revenge but Ellie only looks for a way to forgive Joel (a rather orthodox way to forgive).  The sound of the game is incredible and impeccable\\, the 3d sound is greatly enjoyed from the bullets in a closed space to when shooting at a vehicle\\, whether it punches or bounces\\, it sounds very realistic.  Gameplay clearly an 8 because it is good and it is the first game but as an innovation from the first game to the second the truth is that if they added new mechanics they give freshness to the gameplay.  Before playing the game\\, I had a lot of concern about spreading forced political or progressive garbage. This is really non-existent within the game.  because if you get tired a little bit so much knife in the neck to the enemies.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
