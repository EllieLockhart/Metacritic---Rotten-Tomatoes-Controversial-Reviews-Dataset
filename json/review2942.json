Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A year later\\, and I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)m still disappointed\\, saddened\\, angry and confused at why decisions were made with these characters and movie direction\\, etc.... I know everything has been said and covered extensively on this\\, I guess I just wanted my voice heard as well at my disappointment with my most beloved franchise.","true":true}
