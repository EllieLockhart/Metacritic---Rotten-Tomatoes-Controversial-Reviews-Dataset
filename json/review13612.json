Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt that Rian put too much emphasis on the parallels of Rey and Kylo rather than on the plot itself\\, and it showed. Reducing Finn to running away again like he did in the first movie took him a step backwards in character development. More people were brought into the movie for the express purpose of being killed off\\, and only some of them made sense. I never saw the 'other half of the protagonist' that Rian claimed Kylo to be. All in all\\, the sequel trilogy has only proved their ability to rehash the original trilogy on a more extreme level and trying to pretend they haven't.","true":true}
