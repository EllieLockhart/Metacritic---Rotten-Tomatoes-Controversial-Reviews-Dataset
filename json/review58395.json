Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing this for the first time I tried to convince myself that it was okay. But after seeing it a second time I came to the realization that The Last Jedi does not work for me as a Star Wars movie. Sure\\, it was beautifully shot\\, I'll give it that. But it had terrible plot and character development.\\n\\nWith regards to character development\\, original characters like Luke were completely disrespected. Others like Ackbar\\, Chewbacca\\, C3PO\\, and R2D2 were pushed to the sidelines. When it comes to the new characters\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, Phasma\\, and Snoke were completely lacking in development. Others like Rose and Holdo just got on my nerves completely.\\n\\nWith regards to plot\\, this movie was a hot mess of bait and switch. Luke is important! No wait\\, he is a looser who gave up on life...Ok\\, at least he will train Rey! No wait\\, he will just stick grass in her face and Rey will \\\"train\\\" herself... Ok\\, the codebreaker is important! No wait\\, they just find some random dude who will insure that this plan\/plot point is a pointless failure.... Wow! Leia was just killed! No wait. WTF\\, she just saved herself by becoming Mary Poppins in space... Wow! We finally get to meet and learn about Snoke! No wait\\, he is dead now...Ok\\, but wow! It looks like Rey and Kylo are going to team up! Oh wait\\, never mind... Wow\\, Finn is going to sacrifice himself! Never mind\\, Rose just T-boned him... Wow\\, Luke finally decided to grow a pair and is going to face off against Kylo and the First Order! Oh wait\\, he is just a stupid hologram and not actually there... Oh look\\, apparently stupid holograms are too much for Luke\\, because he just blew away like a fart in the wind. How nice!","true":true}
