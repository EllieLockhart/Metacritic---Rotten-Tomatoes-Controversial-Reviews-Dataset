Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars film ever!  It is truly disgusting what they have done to Lukes character - they have destroyed him!  What's worse is that they have damaged the legacy of star wars so that this movie actually ruins the OT...what the heck!  My childhood has been ruined - Rian Johnson ruined my childhood - he is a #ChildhoodMolester!\\n\\nAs many people have already stated\\, there are a million things wrong with the movie but the way he assassinated Luke is the reason this film gets all the hate...it not that difficult to write Luke an heroic story - bit what does the director do???  He EMBARRASSES him and shamed him by having him milk a sea cow!!!  You can tell the director HATES Luke and his contempt for star wars seeps out from every frame of this movie.\\n\\nDon't watch it\\, it's garbage!!!","true":true}
