Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. I don\u2019t agree with the negative reviews. Most original and genuinely enjoyable Star Wars film since The Return of the Jedi. Dares to go new places while still maintaining the feel and wonder of the Star Wars universe. Difficult at times and complex. But a very good film with great storytelling. ","true":true}
