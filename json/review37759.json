Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was so much to dislike about this movie. I really was blown away by how boring it was and how clearly this new writing staff does not want us to care about its characters. They fixed Kilo Ren and made everyone else so much worse! This was their chance to make Skywalker great and he was a whiny little bitch like always. Rey didn't get trained at all so she's still terrible. Glad u went to an island to become a badass and u spent ur time waving a light saver in the air. Anyone have any clue who smoke is now? Nope! Seriously blown away.","true":true}
