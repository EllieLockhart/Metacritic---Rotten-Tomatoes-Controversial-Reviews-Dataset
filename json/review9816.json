Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great action. Great humor. Th\u00e9 story was amazing. An People say that like isn't Luke. Luke was frustradet alone on th\u00e9 island blaming him self angry. That's why he is like that. But u see the Luke that we all wanted. To see when ... Comes back that's when we all see the Old luke. Great villains kylo een was soo good Adam dit a great job.","true":true}
