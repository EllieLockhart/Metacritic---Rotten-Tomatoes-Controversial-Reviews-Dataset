Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, but it simply fell flat. It felt as though someone had seen episode 7\\, saw the direction it was headed\\, and very forcefully told a completely different story. The villains were at most points made to be nothing more than the butt of the joke leaving a void where a good antagonist should have been. That plus bad pacing made for not only a bad Star Wars movie\\, but a bad movie period. Hopefully episode 9 turns it around.","true":true}
