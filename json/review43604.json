Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not the movie I was expecting but turned out to be the movie I really wanted. The characters are strong\\, colorful\\, and diverse and the story keeps twisting and turning in ways I hadn't expected. I particularly liked the idea that one does not need to come from a lineage in order to achieve greatness. This movie moves the idea of 'The Force' into more nuanced territory illustrating that all things have both the light and dark side and the great ones are those that are able to achieve balance. My favorite Star Wars move since the originals!!","true":true}
