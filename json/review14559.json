Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a family of Star Wars for 30 years. I was so excited when Disney pick up this franchise ( more movies).  So it is with a heavy heart that I say Star Wars is dead!  This movie was by far the biggest disappointment in the run\\, because you expect more. The acting was great\\, they had nothing to work with.  The entire plot for both movies has been done in episodes of 4 + 5.  I probably should start this sentence with spoiler alert but I bet dollars to Donuts that in the next one the resistance is going to build momentum and end the empire.......  #officiallydone","true":true}
