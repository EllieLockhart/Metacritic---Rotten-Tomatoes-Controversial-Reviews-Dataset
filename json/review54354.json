Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how many of these critics got paid off\\, but this movie doesn't deserve an A rating. It's not a bad film\\, but it's certainly underwhelming for what it's suppose to be; that's a brand new Star Wars film. It falters at almost every chance the movie gives itself. You think something great is about to happen at several key moments\\, but it falls flat every single time. This film tried way too hard to confuse the audience\\, instead of just giving them what they wanted. I can't really recommend this\\, and I'm a life-long fan. Where Rogue One succeeded\\, The Last Jedi failed.","true":true}
