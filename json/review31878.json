{"101487":169258,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT: \\n\\nRemember when Star Wars villains were intelligent? I do. Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin were cold and calculated. Devising the perfect psychological manipulation by allowing Princess Leia to escape with Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in order to discover the secret location of their rebel base. Their only fault was underestimating the potential of a small rebel fleet in light of the news that an exploit to their Mega Space Station the Death Star was discovered. \\n\\nBy contrast\\, In The Last Jedi the General Hux is reduced to a joke\\, similar to Sacha Baron Cohen's role in Hugo\\, and Kylo Ren a childish mess. Although I will admit I much prefer Kylo Ren in this film than in the previous debacle.\\n\\nThe real faults of this movie were the character subplots revolving around Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Leia\\, Purple haired feminist commander\\, and the Harry Potter casino. \\n\\nThere were some great scenes\\, don't get me wrong here. If the movie removed some of the horrible and pointless subplots and focused on developing Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Snoke's story this could have been one of the best Star Wars films yet. Instead we cut their development short to a fault. What we could have done during this runtime... Luke's drastic behavior change could have been more believably explained. Rey's story could have developed just a bit more or perhaps in a better direction. The same could be said for Kylo's too. Now Snoke... oh Snoke. If only we could have seen you really do some damage(or at least make us feel more about the damage done\\, even 1 death can cause great viewer impact\\, maybe something along the lines of Snoke ordering Kylo to kill Leia and instead does it himself)\\, do some real evil. Sure there is some sort of cold calculated plan that he devised... and his underestimating his pupil led to his demise... but\\, we didn't really feel it was that believable did we? It was more of a \\\"so what?\\\". Grand Moff Tarkin used the lives of others in an attempt to psychologically manipulate Leia. Snoke uses Kylo's insecurities against him and just looks like a school yard buly\\, at least he was somewhat cold\\, calculating\\, intelligent\\, and all-powerful\\, but nah we don't need that in a story. Let's kill him off. \\n\\nPlot holes\/nitpicks: \\nLightspeed ramming into things (Why not do this in the past?) \\nExplain why Luke is such a coward in a believable way (Maybe some sort of degenerative disease) \\nWhy have Luke astral project instead of being there for real? \\nWhy can the resistance ram their small ships into things to destroy them but when The First Order is out of range because their own ships are too big to catch up they simply tail them for 18 hours so that the resistance can come up with a half ass plan to escape... which brings me to my next point. \\nHow can we have Star Destroyers in the original trilogy know if lifeforms are aboard a small escape pod\\, yet cannot notice that there are lifeforms leaving on a \\\"cloaked\\\" transport ship?\\nCommander Leia in space. \\n\\nAll the \\\"space inconsistencies\\\" that people are mad about can be explained somewhat due to tech we aren't aware of. \\nSuch as... Bombs falling vertically in space instead of floating. (maybe there is a propulsion mechanism on each bomb). \\nOr they are close enough to a planet that gravity exists. \\n\\nAll in all\\, too many more to list\\, but you guys know what they are if you saw it. \\n\\nSad to see Star Wars go this way\\, but it's time to pass it on to another generation of fans or branch off and make our own stories.","true":true}
