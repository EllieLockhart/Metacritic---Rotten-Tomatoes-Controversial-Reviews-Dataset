Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For starters I should make it clear that I am much more of a Star Trek fan then a Star Wars fan so I am not nearly as emotionally vested as many fans here but it seems to me that with this film the series has finally grown up. I loved that Luke has finally moved beyond the myth and trappings of the Jedi culture and legends and letting the galaxy know that it is now time for it to move on to something better. Yoda's cameo basically confirms this\\, at least as I saw it. No more books\\, no more stories\\, no more legends. Time for everyone to grow up. The fact that his death seemed to have the opposite effect on his hopes and aspirations seems to a tragedy to me and I think that we will see the circumstances in the last film. All in all kudos to Rian Johnson for having the balls to make what had turned into a rickety old storyline into something real and profound.","true":true}
