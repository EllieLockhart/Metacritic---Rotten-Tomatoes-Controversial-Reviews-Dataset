Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute worst of all the Star Wars movies. Major plot holes\\, confusing storylines\\, nonsensical actions sequences (hyperdrive crashing battleships and Leia Mary Poppins? Really?)\\, and what they did to Luke's character was an absolute travesty. They may as well just have thrown in Jar Jar Binks as a main supporting character of Rey and Finn\\, so I can just refer to them as the three Stooges of Star Wars. \\n\\nIf there is anyway that I can unsee this garbage please let me know. I would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of Episode I\\, without the redeeming lightsaber battles\\, than watch this movie ever again. Thanks Disney for ruining the Star Wars that I knew and used to love.","true":true}
