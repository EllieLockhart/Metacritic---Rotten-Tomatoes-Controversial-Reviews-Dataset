Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a big Star Wars fan after this movie I am no longer a Star Wars fan Disney ruined Star Wars junk junk junk junk junk Disney should stick to making cartoons leave the grown up movies to the grown ups ","true":true}
