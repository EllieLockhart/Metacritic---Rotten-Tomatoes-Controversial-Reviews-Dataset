Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie really. I saw what they tried to do with themes like nobody can be heroes\\, except the hero we are meant to root for as the last jedi is a pathetic character\\, whiny and has no flaws and can do everything really well\\, just because shes a woman and disney are trying to make up for their racist past themselves. Also bullshit that you cant dislike a movie today for it being terrible story\\, and acting without people saying your sexist or rasict like star trek discovery or all female ghostbusters. Luke being killed of was a mistake\\, not because he died\\, but its the consequences. No more skywalkers if ben solo dies\\, the family dies with him\\, and we have to follow a bullshit character as rey?really?I have no interest in a pretty face man or female who are dumb characters.","true":true}
