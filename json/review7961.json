Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. The constant comedic gags took me out of it and were tonally awkward. There were so many things set up by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens that Rian Johnson just decided to not explore or completely shut down. I hate what he turned Luke Skywalker into. It felt like he had never watched the original trilogy or understood his character. Where the hell were the Knights of Ren? Why is Rey so good at everything with virtually zero training. I am all for strong female characters\\, but this is ridiculous. Completely wasted Phasma and Snoke. Too many cutesy droids\/alien animals. Timelines didn't make sense. TFA was criticized for being too much like the original trilogy\\, so i get why people think it's unfair to criticize this one for taking too many chances\\, but there should be some sort of middle ground. You can break the mold of a series without completely imploding 40 years of story telling.","true":true}
