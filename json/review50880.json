Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abrams made a good star wars movie but not really a good movie and now Johnson has a made a good movie but not really a good star wars movie. In other word\\, while 7 lacked originality it still stayed true to inherent themes and characters of star wars. 8 has done the opposite\\, it's a unique story but unfortunately accomplishes this by disregarding the true defining traits of classic characters like Luke Skywalker. With Abrams and Johnson continuing their unremarkable writing and directorial relationship with Disney\\, it is highly unlikely we will see a truly unique\\, innovative\\, and creative star wars movie in the next decade. The odds are more likely that the star wars franchise will diminish and devalue while more prevalent and impactful stories emerge from movie power houses other than Disney.","true":true}
