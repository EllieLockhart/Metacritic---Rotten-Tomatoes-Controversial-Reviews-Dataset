Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I freaking LOVED this movie. I have yet to talk personally to anyone that did not. I have one Facebook friend (that I know of) who did not like it\\, but he is notoriously fussy about such things.  It was a fun adventure story\\, full of unintended consequences and interesting surprises. I am not sure what is wrong with some people.  Maybe it's that fans\\, especially Star Wars fans\\, love to hate new product (which has been true since Return of the Jedi).  Or maybe it is alt-right bots who hate that a woman could be right\\, and that Luke and Finn and Poe could be wrong.  I don't care.  This score does not seem to reflect any offline reality.","true":true}
