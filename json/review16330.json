Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not sure why so many people hated it\\, it seems people either loved it or completely hated it. It didn\u2019t really answer any of my questions\\, but I loved this movie. It was not like anything that I heard anyone predict\\, so not sure why a lot of people said that it was predictable Disney. I thought it was one of the best Star Wars movies to date\\, and I think that the main question of who Rey is will still be answered in the next movie.","true":true}
