Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it was a fun adventure\\, it does not live up to Star Wars Standards.  I found the story was not well thought out\\, characters were poorly fleshed out\\, characters who were in previous movies were not true to self and important story lines ignored that needed to be dealt with.\\n\\nAs a life long star wars fan I am sad to see that Disney is destroying Star Wars.","true":true}
