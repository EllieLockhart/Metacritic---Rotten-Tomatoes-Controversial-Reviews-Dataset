Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Come on everyone. What plot holes? I can understand you not liking the movie but don't just say random shit because you're upset. This is a great movie in my opinion! Something different? Yes and it works! I get the reasons people don't like it\\, there's some things that make it not a perfect movie\\, but I think it works mostly. Obviously it's not going to be perfect\\, but take a step back\\, this movie is nowhere near as bad as any of the prequels and everyone is treating it like it's the worst star wars and could not be more wrong.","true":true}
