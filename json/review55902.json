Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember when you visited a band of rebels from a long\\, long time ago\\, in a galaxy far\\, far away\\, and you cared about each of them\\, and followed them from their desperate flight in delivering the plans of a deadly weapon into the hands of those who could use them to free the galaxy\\, to the rising up of a young\\, courageous hero\\, and the fall of an Empire? Now \\, take all that and toss it and all the popcorn you couldn't eat\\, due to the loss of appetite this film will give you\\, because we're erasing all the progress the original films concluded with\\, and we're shoving modern feminism\\, plot twists you won't care about\\, countless subplots that lead you nowhere\\, and none of that warmth that kept you cheering on that original band of lovable characters. There are likable moments\\, to be fair\\, and you'll want to care for some of them...  You'll really\\, really want to care... But the overall plot just will not allow it.","true":true}
