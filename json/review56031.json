Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow at times and beyond 3 key moments a solid Star Wars film. Without any massive spoilers a key cgaracter is killed but you will have no way of knowing unless you payed close attention. In addition\\, a largely built up character is killed off when he should be in the end. Otherwise the film is decent. Luke has given up on the Jedi Order\\, and believes it should die. A good amount of the story revolves around he\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Rey. As Luke continues to Train Rey why showing her why he believes it should end\\, Kylo attemps through the force to show Rey why she should join the Dark Side\\, and throughout multiple points in the film\\, Rey is tempted. Meanwhile\\, a sideplot is created with new Chatacter Rose\\, and Finn. In which they go on various missions for the Resistance It leads them from an Emperial controlled Las Vegas Style Track snd Casino to Kylo Ren and Surpreme Leader Snoke's Flagship. In the end various Characters meet their fate. At least 3 recognizable faces die\\, but overall a decent Star Wars entry.","true":true}
