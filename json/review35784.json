Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is gorgeously shot garbage\\, but what it lacks in lightsaber fights it makes up for in Pokemon. I know it's a disney film but how many adorable\\, if not obnoxious critters do we need running around without purpose. Rian Johnson is a visual madman and the Last Jedi boasts some pretty popping eye-candy but what this installment did to the iconic character of Luke Skywalker above all else is unforgivable. Johnson was trying so hard to break away from the Star Wars of Lucas and even Abrams that he completely abandoned the defining fundamentals of the franchise. There is no love here\\, no hope for the future\\, only CGI\\, social commentary\\, and hidden agendas.","true":true}
