The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Even a Score of 90 Points must be a game who is perfect for everyone who like rpg shooters and equals or surpass in every aspect other games with this score. But \\\"TLOU2\\\" is not such a game.\r\rThe grafics\\, the sound are okey\\, its a nice 85\\, but the gameplaymechanics are mostly the same as TLOU Part1\\, some are buffed\\, but not all. So it cant rise to a 90. But the gameplay is still fun and it works\\, so its a good 80 score but not a 90 or even a 95+.\r\rBut than comes the sequel problem. It don't honor the first game with its story. It try to be diffrent but diffrent equals not useful. For me the story don't pull the right strings. The death of joel feels like a betrail\\, like Starwars 8\\, where luke throw away the lightsaber. The developer\\, who was in charge of the story\\, betrails me\\, i don't want such a boring death for this beloved character. And the worst part\\, its not even logical. Beause he was a lone wolf with cup\\, he never would do this action that cause his death.\r\rNext problem is the story itselfe. Its a boring story of revange. It would be far more better\\, if abby capture and torture joel. That you have multible endings like. All die\\, joel die\\, allie die and joel life\\, abby die or all will find a way to life with each other. Even the character abby would be fare more explainable with \\\"i do this because i lost my father and have th\u00ees **** happened to me\\\".\r\rConclusion... a nice game with 85 after all. But the story and the outdated mechanics cost 10 points\\, 5 points for not honor the fans who where betraied. Its a nice 70 game. Not more not les. Because a game with 95+ need to be memorable for decades. Even after the first mass effect i know who is shepard\\, who is tahli and liara. I remember joel and ellie... but abby. i will forget in weeks.\r\rIn the end\\, not a bad game\\, but not a masterpiece. Like a witcher 3 or an masseffect.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
