{"101487":191147,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Updated my review because they weren't counting 1\/2 star Reviews.  I suggest you do the same!\\n\\nI am a big Star Wars fan in Canada\\, I liked all the movies\\, read many of the novels and comics (especially the Legends and Old Republic series) and played a lot of the video games and had the toys as a kid.\\n\\nI'm also a huge cinema fan in general\\, love classic\\, foreign\\, independent and Hollywood films.\\n\\nThis may have been the worst film I've ever seen.  I'd love to hate Rian Johnson and maybe he has some responsibility by I'm more likely to believe this is mostly Disney's  and Kathleen Kennedy's fault.\\n\\nI actually liked a lot of the ideas (Luke as a lost\\, bitter Col. Kurtz type character...Rey and Ren joining forces...Porgs....)  But the execution was really poor and the dialogue was AWFUL.  Every character\\, adult women included\\, talk like 14 year old boys and\/or typical Disney cartoon characters.\\n\\nMy Star Wars now ends at Return of the Jedi (except for the novels and comics already released that take place after that movie).  The Force Awakens is now meaningless because\\, despite being a decent film that intriguingly seemed to set up the rest of the series with exciting new characters\\, now leads to a dead end so it is now basically meaningless.\\n\\nCringe-worthy dialogue that even children were bored with\\, a LOT of attempts at childish humor that mostly falls flat or is self referential enough to make the film feel like a Saturday Night Live sketch (yet as fans we are expected to take the movie more seriously than the movie does itself?  Sorry\\, did I miss something...were the tickets free?) undeveloped characters and side plots that go nowhere.  Boring character introductions and exits.  They took an interesting character like Snoke (is he real or a just a simulated hologram? why is he mutilated? where did he come from? how did he gain control of the First Order?)\\, gave him cheesy Disney-villain dialogue and then took him out of the series as fast as he came in (despite him having built a weapon stronger than the Death Star).  Then\\, his underlings take over the First Order as if nothing happened or he was never there.  Huh?  If a child wrote this film you'd want to go over it with them and correct some of the many flaws in the writing and explain why this or that doesn't make sense...but this was adults\\, with $300'000'000 to blow.  Unbelievable.\\n\\nJohnson stated that more exposition or dialogue scenes would have slowed down the movie.  Huh?  Return of the Jedi has a TON of slow\\, dialogue character development and exposition and that makes the movie in some ways.  At least we know what the hell is going on!\\n\\nI have no issue with Luke being an old\\, angry\\, bitter hermit who wants to end the Jedi order.  But he supposedly found the original Jedi temple (although this varies wildly from the back story Disney themselves already released in their Legends novels and comics).  But that's fine\\, they wanted to do their own thing\\, but then give us something\\, anything.  We learn nothing about the Force\\, nothing about the early Jedi or the first Jedi temple (I guess you were supposed both read the books for that AND THEN ignore them?  I have no idea)\\, we learn almost nothing about what he's been doing since Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nJohn Boyega's \\\"Fin\\\" character brought some good energy to the Force Awakens but here they give him a silly side plot and poor dialogue and halfway through the movie he looked like he just kind of gave up.  Who could blame him?  By the way\\, I felt sorry for all the actors who had to deal with this horribly written dialogue.  Laura Dern is one of the greatest actresses of all time\\, and the lines they give her are horrible.\\n\\nIt was also amazing how many of the scenes and story elements they just re-did from the other movies.\\n\\nI didn't mention the social justice warrior preaching that takes place.  That's fine that the Black guy and the Vietnamese girl need to find the Mexican in order to save \\\"The Resistance\\\" from the horrible white males (they threw in a token Japanese guy too.  Are Japanese evil as well?).  Or that all the male characters in the film are like whiny\\, useless hipsters while all the women take charge.  I mean its stupid\\, but I wouldn't care about it if anything else about the movie was good.  So in the end\\, its just one more turn off. I have NO interested in seeing episode IX\\, nor will I.\\n\\nI figured this would happen one day\\, like maybe in 20 or 30 years there would be a horrible Star Wars that ruins the series...I didn't think it would happen this fast.  Congrats Disney\\, I won't be buying the Bluray\\, or anything else Star Wars related ever again.\\n\\nThe only memorable scene was Luke drinking the milk out of the sea creature.  At least that was original\\, unexpected and made sense.","true":true}
