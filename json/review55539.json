Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No closure on snoke\\, seriously that character is still a huge friggin \\\"what the..?\\\"\\,  no closure on Rey's background or training\\, little to no closure on luke or the Jedi order. Injected love story for finn. \\nWhich isn't horrible\\, but it's one more thing that distracts from what I've already listed as a complaint.  No background on how the first order rose to power...\\n\\nThis is such a let down so many things should've been dealt with","true":true}
