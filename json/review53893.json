Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie\\, once again\\, jus tlike Force awakens. Cheesy.  Its failure is encompassed in the scene where BB8 rescues the rebels in a walker\\, only to have the top conveniently  come off so the audience can see it was BB8.  Pure cheesy writing.  Disney have turned BB8 into a killer and don't even realize it.  Just a disaster of a movie that tries to stay away from all the faults (they realized) of TFA (e.g Kylos use of a helmet\\, knights of Ren etc).  Not too mention it doesn't even try to touch on answering the plot holes of TFA.  The humor was horribly placed and overused\\, and did not fit the star wars universe.  The attempt to satisfy eastern audiences is too apparent (with its take on the Force now revised as how eastern philosophy views balance in life etc) \\, as is the attempt to capitalize on action sequence fillers\\, for the audiences with ADD.  I do not even see how critics are giving this movie a good review\\, unless they are all part of the Disney corporate machine.  Its a completely cheesy movie\\, with its glaring obvious goal of gaining the satisfaction from the non-existent average ADD animal loving person with the 1.7 dog.","true":true}
