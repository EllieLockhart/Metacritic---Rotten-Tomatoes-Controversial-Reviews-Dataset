Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is such an incredible disappointment. I was so hyped for this game that you would literally have to humiliate and brutally murder one of the main characters from the previous game to get me to dislike it. Even then\\, I would probably be open to one of the characters dying\\, if the story was presented in a compelling way. Unfortunately this story is not. In fact\\, you are tasked with playing as your hero's murderer halfway into the game\\, and the writer (Neil Druckmann) wants ever so bad to make you feel sorry for this character. To feel compelled by her story and to sympathize with her torturing and clubbing Joel to death. Well\\, Neil\\, I do not. This story reeks of shock factor for the mere existence of it. It is so far up its own ass you wonder how Druckmann ever came out for air to put this thing into existence.I would never recommend this game\\, especially to fans of the original. This is offensively terrible story writing and it's a shame that the first games writer (Bruce Straley) wasn't here to reign it in.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
