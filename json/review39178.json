Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This excuse of a movie should not even have the honor to be called a Star Wars movie. Just I thought it could not get worse. Total lack of scenario\\, of epicness\\, of star warsness. If you remove most of the story lines\\, it does not change anything in the movie (Finn whole storyline) and what is left is boring as well.\\nThe only interesting dialogue was between Luke and Leia at the end. \\nIt's the first time I'm disappointed enough in a movie to make myself a Rotten Tomatoes account just to rate a movie. Sadly\\, I have to give a minimum of half a star.","true":true}
