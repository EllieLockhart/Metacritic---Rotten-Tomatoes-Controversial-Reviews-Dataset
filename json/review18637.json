Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It only got a half star because I couldn't rate it any lower. Rian Johnson took a bite of Empire Strikes Back\\, chewed on it\\, and spat it in our faces. Do NOT pay to watch this film!!","true":true}
