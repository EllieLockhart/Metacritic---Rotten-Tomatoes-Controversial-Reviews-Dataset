Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of fun\\, a script full of unexpected turns (which is good)\\, some nice nods to the past\\, and a whole slew of new and interesting threads for future films. A much better outing than the some-what patchy VII\\, and a strong contender for one of the greats of the Saga!","true":true}
