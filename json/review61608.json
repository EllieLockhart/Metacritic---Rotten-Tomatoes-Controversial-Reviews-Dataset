The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It is an amazing looking game with great gameplay mechanics. The story is okay as a stand alone game but as a sequel I found it to be boring\\, disrespectful to fans and not at all what I waited for. Joel\u2019s death is rushed and dumb\\, he looked so naive by giving his name and location in a place full of armed strangers. That\u2019s nothing like him. Also I never came around liking Abby. She\u2019s just a character I don\u2019t care about. I get what naughty dog was trying to do but I waited 7 years to play as Joel and Ellie\\, and even if Joel had to die\\, let me play the whole game as Ellie\\, the character I actually care about\\, the one I waited all this time to know more about. I did not wanted to play half of this long awaited game as the character that killed Joel. A couple of hours with Abby would\u2019ve been fine\\, but not half of the **** game. And Joel\u2019s death aside\\, I just didn\u2019t want to play with this characters. I mainly loved the first game because of Joel and Ellie\u2019s relationship\\, all they went through\\, how they end up in a father\/daughter relationship and their backgrounds. Even if Joel had to die\\, let me play this game as Ellie. If they start with such a bold move like killing Joel\\, a character all the fans loved\\, then let the story be about that. Anyone on Abby\u2019s story (including her) could die and I would not care. Also\\, when you finally catch on the cliffhanger\\, they make you beat the **** out of Ellie with Abby. What the **** At least let me play that scene as Ellie\\, let me try to revenge Joel\\, even if the outcome is exactly the same\\, that was something that had to be experienced as Ellie.Overall it is an unique experience that might be worth playing for the graphics alone. But as a huge fan\\, I feel they ruined everything I liked about the first game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
