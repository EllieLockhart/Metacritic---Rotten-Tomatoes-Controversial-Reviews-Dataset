Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start on this horrible addition to the franchise:\\n\\n1. No Back Story at all on Snoke. Who is he? Where did he come from? No one knows.\\n\\n2. Is this a Star Wars Movie or a comedy? Way way way too many jokes.\\n\\n3. Luke Skywalker acts in completely the 100% opposite way his character did in the previous movies. He risked everything to save Darth Vader who is the most evil man in the galaxy because he sensed the smallest amount of good in him. When the son of his Sister and Best Friend exhibits the smallest amount of darkness\\, HE TRIES TO KILL HIM? WTF???\\n\\n4. LEIA IN SPACE - This ruined the whole thing for me. The level of stupidity on this scene is astounding.\\n\\n5. The Finn\/Rose storyline was stupid and pointless.\\n\\n6. Luke Skywalker trained for months on Degobah and Yoda still said he was not ready to face Vader\\, but Rea mediates on a rock for 3 minutes and now all of a sudden she is a Jedi? WTF?\\n\\nGive me JarJar any day over this travesty.","true":true}
