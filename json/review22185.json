Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lacked heart. I did not care about any other the characters... for some reason I felt like an agenda was being pushed on me. great visuals though... however\\, great visuals does not a great movie make.","true":true}
