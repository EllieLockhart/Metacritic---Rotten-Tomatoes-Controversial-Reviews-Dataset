Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie threw away so many legacy characters. The build up of seeing the characters I loved enjoyed as a kid get was great\\, and I feel this movie just looked over the fact that people wanted to see these legacy characters interact and do something. Luke did a little something at the end....it was awful..I really didn't like this movie...if they were going to kill off all the characters of the old movies.. they should have made a new star wars movie that had nothing to do with the originals.","true":true}
