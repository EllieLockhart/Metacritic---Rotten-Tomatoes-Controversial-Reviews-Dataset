Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My heart is broken. I'm not sure what movie all these 'critics' are watching but the movie I saw was an embarrassing mess which gave no consideration to the OT. Sure the visuals were pretty great but the story.... the story?! Wow it was just terrible. The force seems to have been reduced to a convienent excuse for explaining the absurdity of the movie. Leias 'Mary poppins\\nMoment' is a disaster. Luke is given a totally insulting end. Yoda thinks 'yeah why not torch the thing I dedicated my whole life to. Rose and Fin might as well not been in this movie for all the good they did.\\n\\nIt feels like Disneys were desperate to erase anything precious about the OT. George\\, we need you back!\\n\\nIn short\\, I have always LOVED Star Wars but this movie is an insult\\, hate really isn't too strong.","true":true}
