{"101487":132157,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If nothing else\\, this proves that it's possible to inject new life and freshness in a franchise as old (and as sacrosanct) as the Star Wars saga\\, but alas\\, it also proves you cannot please everyone if you consider some of the baffling\\, and frankly close-minded\\, reactions online. In my humble opinion\\, Rian Johnson has done a brilliant job. Like The Force Awakens which 'homaged' A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi follows in the footsteps of The Empire Strikes Back: the bad guys are chasing after the good guys and there's a young Jedi in training. However\\, Johnson is less slavish and his film doesn't feel as much of a remake of TESB as TFA was with ANH. In fact\\, one of its main strengths is that its ability to stand on its own merit without resorting to nostalgic familiarity. This is a cheekier and totally refreshing continuation of the story and it constantly undercuts expectations and takes unusual twists and turns that only a visionary and confident film-maker who dares to put his own distinctive stamp on a beloved franchise can make. While the narrative is not perfect - the mid-film detouring really serves little purpose other than setting up spectacular set pieces\\, but they are so spectacular and entertaining\\, they are just about worth it. A captivating Adam Driver stands out this time amongst a starry ensemble\\, with Mark Hamill's curmudgeonly return as Luke Skywalker and the last on-screen performance of Carrie Fisher being simply irresistible and divine respectively. And I haven't even lavish praise on Johnson's effective\\, breath-taking and inspired visuals and staging that give the film its own distinctive look. Only time will tell\\, but Johnson has upped the game for the next Episode and this may yet prove to be the best film of this trilogy.","true":true}
