Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Disney to the Light:  This is not the Solo you are looking for. . .  Boycott! (or at least side step!) -  When I talked with my friend about whether we should go to the new Solo\\, she told me that she couldn't resist seeing the new Solo\\, but she also did not want to support the Disney betrayers of what George Lucas gave us all. So she is going to pay for a ticket to another film\\, then hijack a seat on honor of Solo\\, partly to satisfy any curiosity and yet more to become more self aware of Disney's next Assassination of SW Allegory attempt. -  I agree! . . .  \\n     Why not buy a Solo ticket?  Because the only way to bring SW back to the light is to bring down those now in charge of the franchise.  -  Economics trump personal\/social agendas\\, and if they can't keep SW ticket sales with Marvel\\, those in charge of Lucas Films Disney will be Forced out.  .  . Star Wars has been deceptively taken over -   Now it is up to all of us.  We must take it back.  George Lucas gave us all lessons on the Light and Dark side.  We learned it as inspiring fiction\\, our eras allegory of hope for redemption in family and self.  - Now the fiction comes to true life as we must protect the values of this story. - Kathleen Kennedy and others vowed to honor Lucas' creation and to carry forth the characters and values.  Instead they stabbed the heart (Luke) and removed the soul (hero's journey).  We must not support this\/those who attack true values and us.  \\n   Many defenders of this dark betrayal degrade honest talks into hyperbole\\, missing the self-contradiction that defending TLJ by personally attacking those who support SW is an attack on the foundational support of SW itself\\, both culturally and economically.   Tragically they do not know that our protectiveness is born of a sadness.  It is true that we are attached to the past\\, as all people are attached to the past and stand on the shoulders of ancestors.  Naturally we feel a great sadness for the betrayal of Luke's character and the fundamentals of the SW story.  We feel so sad that even months (and years if need be) later  protective threads of frustration are streaming from the millions who are mourning the desecration of both the past SW inspiration as well as the destruction of the future SW inspiration.  For should Luke's character be destroyed\\, also Rey's character will be destroyed.  .  .  \\n   We all wanted Rey to be great.  We went to FA with open hearts and minds wishing to witness her hero's journey become our next generation carrier of the Torch of Hope.  Yet with the destruction of Luke's character\\, the torch is extinguished.  For if Luke\\, the greatest Jedi-bringer of redemption\\, lost all that he gained then SW has no meaning\\, no light.  With no Light the new (Disney) SW is founded on nothing.  So Rey means nothing\\, and for her we are all sad. - We all wanted her to become a great Jedi.  (Ironically\\, not only did the Disney writers betray Lucas' true SW\\, in doing so they betrayed the feminist potential that Rey could have grown to greatness from).  Instead Rey is written to BE great from nothing: no lessons\\, no training\\, no meaningful past\\, no loss\\, no mentorship\\, no failures\\, no growth arc.  She is deprived of the chance of growing to become a great (woman) Jedi and instead represented as a girl who just has all Jedi abilities and understandings\\, from nothing. . . \\n   There is no hero's journey without any development of who Rey is\\,  where she comes from\\, what she values\\,  and how she grows to champion these values.  Luke needed Obi-wan\\, and Yoda.  Obi-wan needed Qui gon. And so forth. (Luke also needed Leia and Han Solo\\, and even R2 and C3PO ) -  Representing that Rey does not need a mentor\\, or father\\, debases the fundamental understanding of Star Wars - which at it's core is about these family relationships.  SW is fundamentally about expressing (in a fantastic drama in space) the painful growth between parent and child (and sibling & friend)\\, including the teaching and redemptive determination between child & father figure (mentors -good or bad) and self.   With none of this Rey has no story\\, no loss\\, nothing to gain\\, no story for us to witness her become great.  We so wished for her to be great\\, as Luke is. \\n   Missing the fundamental relationships and a growth arc\\, Rey is not really a SW protagonist\\, and without a hero's arc these Disney films are not really SW movies. - - - Luke still exists as the carrier of our great SW allegory.  We would love a beautiful and inspiring new SW story  -  -  - The only way to truly get more SW movies is to have people of Inspiration and Understanding and Genius Vision create them.  It may be that WE must carry forth the Only Hope to free Star Wars.  \\n    We value these stories so we should focus our value. - The bit of force in a movie ticket (times millions)\\, withheld\\, could move shareholders to demand a change at Disney\\, to remove those who betrayed their promises to Lucas and to us.","true":true}
