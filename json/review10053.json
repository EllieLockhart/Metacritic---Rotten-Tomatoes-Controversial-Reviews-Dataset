Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great! I like how they took elements of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi while also taking their own risks. The casino scene wasn't my favorite\\, I felt as if they could have ended that a lot quicker\\, but I thought that everything else worked great!","true":true}
