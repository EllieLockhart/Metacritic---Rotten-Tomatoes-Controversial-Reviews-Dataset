Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy\\, I LOVED this movie!!!  It certainly had moments that were awe inspiring.  One of the plot lines was a bit dim\\, but the main story was great.  There is also one moment (which I will not spoil) that made me so happy to see that I shed a small tear of joy.  I can't wait to see where episode IX goes with this.  For now though\\, do yourself a favor and go see this one!","true":true}
