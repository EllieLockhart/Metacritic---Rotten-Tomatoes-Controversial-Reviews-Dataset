Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars saga has been recognized as one of the most influential\\, compelling stories released in history. However this movie changed it all. With gaping plot holes\\, no character development\\, unnecessary plot twists\\, and horrible choreography it leaves the fans wondering what happened to this once respected series. The force is not with series anymore unless The Rise of Skywalker has something to offer.","true":true}
