Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst of all the Star Wars films\\, the story line was choppy characters has no chemistry plus the ending will have most fans angry. this story line was about one thing and the last Jedi changed the direction of the story with such an unnatural flow it ruined hope this part of star wars will recover.","true":true}
