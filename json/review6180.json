Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney gives the middle finger to every life long Star Wars fans in this disjointed\\, poorly written movie where Disney is determined to kill off every beloved Star Wars character in order to replace them with Disney's new generation of Star Wars heros.  I actually have no desire to see Episode IX.  Shame on you Disney\\, you owe all Star Wars fans an apology.","true":true}
