Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not gonna say that this movie is a big letdown (because it's all just a big cash-grab\\, obviously)\\, but it's certainly a step back after The Force Awakens. The first movie set the stage almost perfectly for the new trilogy as a soft reboot. The Last Jedi\\, however\\, wasted it's potential to create new powerful story. \\\"Wasted potential\\\" are main words for this movie - there were some interesting concepts\\, but it wasn't enough because of pointless subplots\\, a bunch of plot holes\\, forced infantile humor\\, etc. Soundtrack is surprisingly bland\\, even with genius John Williams in charge\\, relying too much on music from previous movie plus countless attempts to force emotions with variations of \\\"Luke's theme\\\". The biggest problem of this movie is that it leaves you with no desire to watch the next one\\, because of how much it actually relies on subverting fan expectations and standard movie tropes for it's own sake. Most of all it damages characters - almost none of them are interesting to watch and root for. Basically\\, this movie proves once again that even with all money and technological wonder Disney could provide you still need strong script to succeed. Maybe look through expanded universe next time\\, they really have some interesting ideas here and there.","true":true}
