Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an absolute travesty. Anyone involved in the creative direction of this series should be held accountable for this mindless piece of garbage that was put on screen. They need to fire everyone involved especially those in charge at Lucas Film. \\n\\nMore importantly everyone should go to Mark Hamill's Twitter or FB and give him praise for their treatment of Luke Skywalker\\, no wonder he was so upset with the direction of the film. I'm done with the Disney version of SW\\, I'm sticking to what I grew up with since 1977\\, THE ORIGINAL  TRILOGY.","true":true}
