Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. It destroys Star Wars lore\\, and Luke as a character. The Visual dictionary that comes along with this movie destroys Star Wars lore even more. It's terrible don't watch it. Don't give disney your money\\, go buy Heir To The Empire and read that series instead.","true":true}
