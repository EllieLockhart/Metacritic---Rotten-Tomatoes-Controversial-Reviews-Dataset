Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson takes big risks with franchise canon in The Last Jedi -- a few of which are clever and progress the overall arc of the sequel trilogy and others which provide very little payoff. Some of the would-be \\\"aha\\\" moments come across as lazy (cheap)\\, forced\\, and unnecessary -- especially considering the big questions and plot points intentionally raised by the writers of The Force Awakens. The script also alludes to current events (think military-industrial complex) with the Canto Bight sequence\\, but unfortunately\\, this creates a particular plot thread that is distracting and out-of-place. One could even argue that this sequence feels like it belongs in the prequels - right down to sub-par CGI and cheesy dialogue. As a whole\\, the movie intriguingly explores the \\\"connection\\\" between Kylo Ren and Rey (and to a lesser extent\\, the mentor\/mentee relationship between Luke and Rey). Despite a questionable script\\, Mark Hamill's performance is impressive\\, most impressive\\, and Carrie Fisher's final performance as Leia is remarkable. Other highlights include Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron\\, beautiful cinematography\\, unique and crafty battle sequences\\, and a few well-used moments of humor (including a very memorable line said by a long-time franchise favorite). Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo is well-played but awkward. Ten to twenty years down the road\\, it will be interesting to see how this is viewed within the context of all the other Star Wars movies (including those yet to come). After all\\, this is the middle chapter of the new trilogy\\, and it is not meant to provide a complete sense of resolution and finality. Hopefully\\, Episode IX will tie up just enough loose ends to \\\"save\\\" the many low-points of The Last Jedi and keep it (or rather\\, make it) relevant.","true":true}
