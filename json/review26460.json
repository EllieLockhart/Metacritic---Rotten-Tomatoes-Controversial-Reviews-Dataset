Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now this met my expectations. \\nFranchise altering story\\, proper homage to the originals\\, with an ending that is only fitting to the Hero's Journey. \\nI'm on the \\\"Bravo\\\" side. Adam and Daisy have taken the torch and run with it. \\nBack then\\, \\\"Empire\\\" had this amount of divisivness...\\nMark Hamill....??\\nRian...dude...you nailed it\\, sir.
