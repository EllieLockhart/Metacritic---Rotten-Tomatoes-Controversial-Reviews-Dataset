Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" will leave the viewer with mixed feelings. It is a movie that we want to love\\, yet are not satisfied with. The humor in this movie is a bit forced and cheesy at times\\, as it felt like an unnecessary addition to grab the attention of the younger audience and easily amused. The movie leaves you with no feelings for the characters. When a moment arises that should have the viewer feeling either happy or sad one is often left with a feeling of neutrality. During the opening sequence cheers erupted at the nostalgic theme we've all come accustomed to\\, yet by the end of the movie only a small forced set of mixed claps could be heard as if a student had just given a class presentation and everyone knows they should clap. There were no cheers by the end and you could tell those who left had more questions leaving then they did going in. Although there are some key moments that will provided an immense visual appeal the story structure does not hold up and characters are dismissed as mere filler.","true":true}
