Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Spoilers. This game is probably one of the worst stories I have ever experienced. Honestly I am so disappointed with naughty dog and I just wish this game never existed in the first place. First of all\\, there was absolutely no need for a sequel because the game should have just ended with Ellie and Joel arriving at Jackson. If they really wanted to make a sequel then they should have just made a DLC where they don't kill Joel like its nothing and make a completely new character which shows up out of nowhere. The thing that makes the game so bad isn't just the fact that they killed Joel but the fact that they made Ellie dislike him because he tried to save a childs life. Why would you make her dislike him when shes too young to even decide for herself? Whats even worse is that naughty dog puts 8 hours of gameplay with Abby\\, the character that shouldn't have even existed and that is utterly despised for murdering Joel. I find this part truly disgusting because they tried to make us have sympathy for her? Why the **** would you do that naughty dog? This part of the game just makes me hate her more and makes me feel 0 sympathy towards her. I honestly wish someone questioned Neil Druckmann when he was making up this story\\, if he was actually sane at the time of creating the storyline. Lastly I beg you not to play this game if you wish to continue liking the last of us franchise because the sequel ruined it for me. Thank you naughty dog for ruining a game that was amazing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
