Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hated it\\, wanted to like it. Liked clone wars even better. The whole thing felt like a theme park ride. Couldn't follow anything\\, felt shallow. Aimed at 5 year olds. For instance\\, when comparing the humour to Thor Raga's\\, it is at the opposite end of the spectrum of wit. So clich\u00e9\\, so forced\\, not enough big epic star-wars\\, and far too much dark indoor face closeups. The the lack of realism (like when a character pilots a canopy-less craft only to see a slight breeze in their hair) and no buffeting air is plain ridiculous. It reminds me of the romantic in-car shots of the 60's - made on green screen with cars on rollers. I feel sorry for all the actors wedged in there\\, with no where to go! NO where to take the story. Disney have really milked this one dry!","true":true}
