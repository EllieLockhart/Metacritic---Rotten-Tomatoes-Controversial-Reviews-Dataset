Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Reboot to the series. It is time to let go of the past. To create such poetic imagery and complexly layered movie is a difficult task. As in life it is always difficult to cope with the character arcs of our favourite heroes come to an end but a new hope can only then be reborn.","true":true}
