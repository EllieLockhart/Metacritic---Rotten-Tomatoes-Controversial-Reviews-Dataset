{"101487":130003,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe Last Jedi can be more awful than Force Awakens. Absolutely terrible\\, plot is a mess and illogical\\, no development for Rey's character\\, Finn sidelined to background noise\\, no explanation to why the 1st Order can become so powerful than the New Republic since the latter was victorious in Ep 6\\, all the mythos set in previous episodes is thrown out of the window\\, Luke's legacy destroyed in the most disrespectful manner.","true":true}
