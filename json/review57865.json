Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, Star Wars was doomed to be next.  Star Trek went down first.   Taken down by the real dark side of the force\\, progressivism.  All the poor reviews are essentially correct.  This movie is the product of liberal thinking and liberal fantasy.  Think about it.   Anti-capitalism --- it's there.  Feminism --- there.   Animal rights --- there.   Disregard for anything holy or canon --- there.   Nihilism (meaninglessness) --- there.   Progressive liberal moviemakers are more interested in changing your thinking then entertaining you.   If you complain about a lack of heroism\\, too bad.   Heroes can only exist where there is a common acceptance of right and wrong\\, and where the first is celebrated.   Liberalism can't stand male heroes.  That's why they want to take down the NFL eventually.  \\nHollywood is a moral cesspool\\, so let's not be too surprised at what they are churning out.   Goodbye Star Wars.","true":true}
