Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Biggest Star Wars fan going into this movie...left betrayed as if my childhood was stolen from me. Too much emphasis on the new characters while destroying the depth of the old ones and desecrating basic concepts that make the original movies so powerful and meaningful. Terrible way to end a legacy and go into the final part of the trilogy. George Lucas's vision has been obliterated..","true":true}
