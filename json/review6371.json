Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney really outdid themselves\\, this is one of the most mediocre corporate purely money making films ever. Diversity hires\\, bad plot filled with holes\\, bad humour \\, the list goes on and on . You literally cannot get immersed while watching it with all these arbitrary forced things that make no sense happening all the time.  But it still sold tickets and I bet it will sell even more toys so the audience gets the movies it deserves.","true":true}
