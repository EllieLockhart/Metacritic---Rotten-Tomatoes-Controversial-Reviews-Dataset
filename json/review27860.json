Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal movie. Johnson proves himself to be the perfect fit for this film as he not only delivers a visually stylish and beautiful film\\, but also an intelligent and emotionally captivating story that was smart in focusing on developing its characters rather than strictly progress the plot\\, delivering some stellar displays of conflict in the characters and some surprising twists that break new ground for the franchise\\, alongside some very good performances from its cast\\, especially Hamill\\, Fisher\\, Ridley and Driver\\, and solid supporting performances from Isaac and Serkis. This is\\, hands down\\, the second-best film in the franchise behind Empire.","true":true}
