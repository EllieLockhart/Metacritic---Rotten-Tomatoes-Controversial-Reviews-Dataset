Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(my caps lock is off\\, yet rotten tomatoes seems to OVERRIDE that for some reason)\\n Amazing visuals cannot negate objectively bad fan fiction-esque writing. \\nCheap laughs cannot distract from disregarding the nature of established characters. \\nSubverting expectations for the sake of subverting expectations cannot excuse builds ups that lead to disappointment.\\nGiving the fans what they want does not mean you need to cave to their every whim and desire\\, but it is far worse to simply spit in their faces instead.\\nBlaming your failures on the very people who made your success possible and labeling them as something they are not cannot not save you.\\n\\nI actively tried to like this movie\\, to feel what the movie wanted me to feel. I just ended up depressed.\\n\\nAnd finally\\, Rotten Tomatoes\\, adjusting algorithms to not count reviews with zero stars is still not enough to bring this movie above 50%. Laughable. Leaving this movie half a star as a result. Just know Lucasfilm\\, you didn't earn it.","true":true}
