Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thankfully it is not an \\\"Attack of the Clowns\\\" travesty\\, but it's certainly not an \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" analogue. Like many modern movies it is bloated\\, with the Rose\/Finn story arc being 40 minutes that could have been excised at little cost. The important moral behind  Rose's sacrifice could have been included in another way (Finn saving Reay?). And whilst the seemingly downbeat non-resolution of Reay's origins makes sense\\, the swift despatch and no coherent origin story for Snoke is hugely unsatisfying\\, and\\, like the film as a whole\\, ignored the basic tenets of taut cinematic storytelling. The humour\\, whilst trying to nod at the lightness of tone in the original\\, and not being anywhere near as annoying as Jar-Jar\\, was still jarring (No pun intended). All in all\\, disappointing though not entirely disastrous.","true":true}
