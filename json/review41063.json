Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie Granted was not what I wanted to see when I went to the Movies. All the Qiuestions I had Going Into the movie were not only left unanswered they were gone as well because they no longer mattered like \\\"Who Is Snoke\\\". When the movie was later released on Netflix i gave it a second viewing knowing non of my questions would be answered\\, i honestly was just bored and down to watch the Kylo and Rey Montage scene and it was upon second viewing i enjoyed what i was watching. The Last Jedi is a second viewing movie.","true":true}
