Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh\\, I came into TLJ with the idea formed from TFA that these aren't \\\"Star Wars\\\" movies in any real sense. They are SJWs in space movies wearing a gutted Tauntaun to try to smell like it might be Star Wars\\, but in reality just stinks pretty bad. If you go into them with that in mind\\, the cinematography and special effects are pretty nice. The characterizations are SJW visions of what heroes and villains are. The plot was weak with many unnecessary and bizarre details that didn't fit anything from the previous continuity. ?","true":true}
