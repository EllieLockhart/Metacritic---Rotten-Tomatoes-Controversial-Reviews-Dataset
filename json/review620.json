But unlike games such as Telltale's The Walking Dead where some things will happen no matter what you do\\, in Until Dawn your choices matter and affect the story.\r\rUntil Dawn's story is about a group of 8 young people who go on vacation at a winter resort in the mountains only to get into trouble because (surprise!) there is a psycho killer on the loose. The story begins awkwardly but soon it finds its pace\\, and diverts from a simplistic Scream-like plot into a Resident Evil-esque one. The game's atmosphere is tremendous thanks to the amazing job done by the artists and graphics programmers of Supermassive Games.\r\rGameplay is pretty simple\\, you explore the environment and look out for clues or objects to interact with. There are many indian totems scattered around which offer visual hints of things to come (like a character's potential death or a way to escape from a trap). But most of all\\, the game's full of choices to make. Some times you will have to defend a person in an argument\\, other times you will have to sweet talk to them. The game's also full of QTEs\\, but failing one doesn't necessarily mean instant death. There are also some nice motion control events and I suggest you play with motion controls enabled\\, it adds to the game's immersion. Your overall choices will affect the fate of every character. By the story's end\\, some characters may get killed\\, maybe all of them will die\\, maybe everybody will survive. It's up to you.\r\rMy only gripe is the camera. It's not free to rotate like in most games. It's like the old Resident Evil games\\, it's static and transitions into a new point of view as you walk around. It works\\, but I don't like a static camera. Oh\\, and the killings can be too gorey for my tastes.\r\rOverall this game is fantastic. It's suspenseful with plenty of plot twists and surprises\\, your choices affect the story\\, and it's built for replayability. Go into this game and try to survive\\, ehm\\, Until Dawn.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
