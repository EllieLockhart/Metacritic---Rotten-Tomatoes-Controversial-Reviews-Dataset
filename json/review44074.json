Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is not a bad movie\\, but you can guess that hindering restrictions were made to one of Disney's finest licenses when it comes to more drastic storytelling\\, which ultimately leads to a dull attempt to create a second TESB and a loss of suspense that could indicate a problematic point of departure for a third installment in the new series.","true":true}
