Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4.5 stars because it succeeds immensely but does so by defying expectations that create a few hollow moments. Having seen the movie\\, I don't think they could have done better under the weight of those expectations. Either they had to make a rehash of fan theories and been-there-done-that Extended Universe stories\\, or they had to do something unexpected and\\, with the rigid restriction of doing something that pays homage and rings true but is also breathtakingly new while mired in the overpopulated sea of ways this continuation has already been imagined\\, I think they did an amazing job. Even not considering the challenge as I've described it\\, it's great\\, but if you consider that it had to be at once heartbreakingly classic and surprisingly new\\, it's a very impressive achievement.","true":true}
