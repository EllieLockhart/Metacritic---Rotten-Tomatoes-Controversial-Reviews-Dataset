{"101487":101260,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All these people giving the movie 1 star or a 1\/2 star\\, really? Anyone that rates this movie so poorly is either just exaggerating because the movie didn\u2019t meet their expectations or just isn\u2019t a true Star Wars fan. It wasn\u2019t the best of the series\\, but it did take it in a new direction which opens up a lot of new possibilities. The new characters are all still extremely likable and are primed to carry on the saga without the heroes from episode 4-6. The Last Jedi has lots of action and a good plot. I doesn\u2019t really answer well some questions that I think everyone was hoping for. I still have no real idea who Snoke is and despite how powerful he is made to initially seem\\, he ends up being a fairly weak character. His origin is still a complete mystery\\, and he ends up being more of a subplot than a super villain. You do find out who Rey\u2019s parents are\\, sort of. It is very anticlimactic and does not give any explanation as to how she is so strong in the Force. There are so many plot twists in the movie that it at times seems disjointed. Definitely worth watching though if you\u2019re a Star Wars fan. They can\u2019t all be the best movie ever\\, and it does do a great job of opening up possibilities for episode 9 and beyond.","true":true}
