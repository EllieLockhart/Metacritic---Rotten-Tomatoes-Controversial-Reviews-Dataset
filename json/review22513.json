Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me preface this by saying that some of my favorite Star Wars stories from the Expanded Universe have female leads\\, and ummm\\, @ Disney\\, here's a hint: Star Wars has always been about diversity. So don't you dare label lifelong fans as racist\\, sexist\\, fanboys because we don't like your trash movie. As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I have every right to call this movie the pile of garbage that it is without being lumped into your imaginary group of people who supposedly have a problem with what you made because of some underlying bigotry. Thankfully this site gives the audience a voice too\\, so we can help set the record straight and give you a clue too. \\n\\nWake up Disney. Sci Fi movie goers just want good stories that take them out of present reality\\, with respect for beloved characters and storylines\\, quality character development and to not have current political and social agendas rule the decision process in how the movie develops. This story is a pile of garbage and is plagued with poor attempts at humor\\, established character trashing\\, and poor storytelling that is lost in a sea of SJW agenda.\\n\\nFrom the opening scene\\, the viewer is repeatedly drawn out of the fantasy onscreen to ask themselves questions like\\, \\\"Was that funny?\\\"\\, and \\\"Did that make any sense?\\\". Sure\\, a casual viewer might walk out of the theater with some sense of satisfaction due to the great cinematography\\, a critic might write a good review because the movie appealed to their own agenda or technical knowledge of film making\\, but the fans... the fans. The fans are the ones who buy the toys and teach the lore to their kids\\, the fans are the ones who made Star Wars a multi-billion dollar franchise\\, and what you've done is trash the fans' great love and defend your choices by calling them names. \\n\\nI'm not sure you completely understand the magnitude of the offense you've committed against the fans with this movie\\, yet. But you will. As sales continue to drop\\, as the new movies continue to decline in popularity and success behind other franchises who treat their fans with respect *cough* Marvel *cough*\\, you will continue to scratch your heads and wonder where it all went wrong. Well\\, look in the mirror. Because you did it by alienating your fans\\, trashing their characters\\, giving them movies that put your agenda first and the love of storytelling second. \\n\\nWe have a voice\\, and each time you hear it say your movie sucked\\, your public response is to call us names and defend your use of these movies as a stage for your agenda. It's really pathetic. I could go on and talk about all the bad choices that were made in order to promote your agenda over good storytelling\\, but it's very apparent to anyone with half a brain who see's it\\, and there are plenty of people talking about it anyway. I'll just wrap this up here and save us both the time.","true":true}
