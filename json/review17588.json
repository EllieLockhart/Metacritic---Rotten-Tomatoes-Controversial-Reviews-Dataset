Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I sorely miss the look and feel of the prequels. And Luke Skywalker would never try and kill his nephew. And would never hide and sulk. And we never saw him in action. And the rest\\, garbage. Some of the Kylo and Rey stuff was interesting\\, then wasted.","true":true}
