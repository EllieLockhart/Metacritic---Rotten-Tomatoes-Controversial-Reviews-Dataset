Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd like to know what Disney thinks the average fan is going to be looking forward to seeing in the next episode. \\n\\nAny interesting character from any Star Wars movie is now either dead or meaningless.  Any interesting story angle from The Force Awakens has been driven off the tracks in The Last Jedi.  I wanted an interesting story of who Rey was\\, who Snoke was\\, how he got to his level of power.  But now that anyone of interest is dead and apparently anyone with zero training can use the force\\, I no longer care.\\n\\nBy the end of TFA\\, I had a vested interest in Poe and Finn\\, but they were so under\/misused in the Last Jedi\\, I no longer care.  This movie was beyond boring to me\\, it was insulting.  \\\"Rose\\\" is there to preach to us about animal rights.  \\\"Holdo\\\" was there to show us that women are in charge now.  I didn't care for the SJW propaganda and found it insulting to have to pay to listen to this crap.\\n\\nI won't watch the next movie because I don't like the new character Rose and I don't care anymore about the old characters from TFA.  And\\, I won't pay to be lectured to.","true":true}
