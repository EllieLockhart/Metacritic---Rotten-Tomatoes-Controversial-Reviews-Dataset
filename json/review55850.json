Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Proposing that there's no absolute good and evil\\, that both Jedi and Sith were equally wrong because of their dogmatism and that both of those factions used the Force and viewed themselves as good (as a mean to reinforce their power) is treason against the core morality that was deeply embedded in Lucas' original philosophy\\, one that he tried to build in the tradition of ancient mythology: he carefully showed how this relativistic \\\"grey view\\\" of good and evil is just a trick used by the dark side\\n\\nModern psychologists and philosophers\\, such as Jordan B. Peterson\\, are now opposing post-modernism by re-elaborating the work of western philosophers such as Nietzsche\\, Schopenhauer\\, Jung and Campbell. They see the relativistic approach to morality as only partially true\\, as it ignores the evolutive and social consequences of disposing of the dualistic war between good and evil that lies at the root of western culture (and\\, explicitly\\, in Lucas' original approach to the symbolic narrative of Star Wars)\\, negating the inherent conceptual difference between acts of objective evil and objective good and thus removing the moral compass from society. This view of morality has led to the modern state of relativistic (or non-existing) moral values that is characteristic of the consumerist\\, individualistic individual\\, full of feelings of meaninglessness\\, which modern capitalist societies tend to produce. Disney is pushing this philosophical deformation of Lucas' original vision\\, the Campbellian Hero's Journey\\, precisely because they want to reinforce those kind of individuals in our society.
