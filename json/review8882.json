{"101487":121881,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the past week I was struggling with myself. I had a very important decision to make. And now that I decided\\, I'm feeling relieved. I finally decided to not watch The Last Jedi on the cinema. And I don't know if I'll watch it on DVD or Blu-Ray or Netflix or whatever... It was not an easy decision but I know it was the right one. I already know what happens on the film and I don't want to see those things happening with my own eyes. I don't want to see Luke milking an alien cow\\, I don't want see him denying his nature\\, I don't want to see him desisting his life and dying in the first film he really appeared after more than 30 years\\, I don't want to see Leia flying like an old and pathetic version of Supergirl\\, I don't want to see a villain that dies in his second film\\, I don't want to see the ridiculous Marvel kind of humor in a so called Star Wars film\\, I don't want to see an unknown boy with a broom\\, and I don't want to see new characters with zero charisma. Two years ago\\, after seeing The Force Awakens\\, I left the cinema feeling sad and empty. There was a big hole in my chest. I felt that I watched a film but this was not the saga I love. It was not part of it. And this new one is even worse!\\nThe sad reality we all have to face is: Disney's focus are not the real fans of the saga. Those who love it and understand it. Those who really care about the meaning of the saga\\, the meaning of those characters including the prequel's characters. Disney's focus is to target the new generation and the general public to sell toys and games and make lots and lots of money with NO story\\, NO plot\\, NO Star Wars soul. This is not Star Wars it's Star Wa...lt Disney! It's something different! For a different public. \\nWe can see that the first six films form a saga. There is a huge connection between them. They have a meaning\\, a purpose\\, a reason to exist. They came from the mind of a man who knew what he wanted to tell\\, he had a story about a Father and his children\\, a story of redention. He could make some things that some people would love or not but it was HIS saga! And now we realize that the saga doesn't exist anymore. Disney is really trying to fool us all! But the real fans won't buy it! \\nBy reading the comments of those who like this film we see that most of them are general public. They say: \\\"I know nothing about Star Wars\\, but I like the film\\\"\\, or \\\"I like Star Wars but I'm not a huge fan\\\". They also say: \\\"This is only a film\\\". NOOOOO\\, it's not only a film! It was supposet to be Star Wars\\, and Star Wars has not been only a film (or only films) for decades!\\nSo\\, we have to face the sad truth about Disney intentions\\, but we don't have to agree or accept it!\\nAs long as we keep going to the cinema and giving them our money\\, they will continue making their Star WaltDisney for kids and for entertaining people and making money. They don't take Star Wars seriously. We do! So\\, let's stop going to the cinema! Let's not watch this film. Let's not watch the next film (no matter if it's JJ doing the next\\, he is the one who started to screw SW with that empty The Force Awakens)! Let's NOT got to the cinema to see NOTHING that comes from Disney with the Star Wars logo! Let's boycott this infamous Star WaltDisney!","true":true}
