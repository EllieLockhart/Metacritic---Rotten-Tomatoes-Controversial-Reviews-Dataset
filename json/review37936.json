Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These movies are being written for young audiences. Disney is grooming the next generation of Star Wars fans by writing witty quips and big action into the existing Star Wars universe. These feel more like Marvel superhero movies than anything else. I expect that the anthology movies will be more adult-oriented for hardcore fans while the trilogies will be mainstream and easily digestible.","true":true}
