Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between this and Rogue One\\, Disney\/Lucasfilm is taking a ballsy\\, forward-thinking approach to Star Wars. Where Force Awakens was all about nostalgia\\, The Last Jedi is about clearing the decks and about reframing what a Star Wars movie can be.\\n\\nAnd I think that's wonderful.","true":true}
