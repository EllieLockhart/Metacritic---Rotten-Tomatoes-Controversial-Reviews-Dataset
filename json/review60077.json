I went in with an open mind but couldn't quite gel with the new characters despite the game's best efforts.  There is no doubt the game plays well but the story IMO was a major let down and prevents this game from matching calibre of the first one. I was left feeling let down by the end\\, and the game seemed to drag on for far too long.If it had finished sooner I feel it would of served the game better.ND seemed to be going for shock value over substance which is a real shame.The flashbacks just reminded of how much I loved the bond of the characters from the first game.I feel this game was a grand missed opportunity and not worth the 7 year wait. I wished they had left it as a stand alone game and not made a sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
