Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some jokes that i felt did not match the tone that i wanted from a star wars movie and a slower middle act. The last Jedi provides a refreshing and surprising amount of twists and genuine character development for the majority of the major characters that helps elevate this film above the standard blockbuster.","true":true}
