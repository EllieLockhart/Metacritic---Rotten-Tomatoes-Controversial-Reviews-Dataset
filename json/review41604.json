Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is God Awful. The only saving grace is Adam Driver (Kyle Ren). The characters are boring and most of them can\u2019t act i.e Kelly Tran\\, John Boyeaga & Daisy Ridley. The plot sucked & The comedic breaks were the opposite of funny. ","true":true}
