Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many of the plot lines made no sense at all and were just BORING (especially that slow \\\"chase\\\" of the armada vs the one ship. Couldn't one or two of the armada just hyperspace in front of the ship?)\\nSo many small things didn't make any sense in the Star Wars universe (Leah floating harmlessly through the vacuum of space\\, how one little ship can destroy a huge one simply by going into hyperspace into it - no one ever thought of that before??)\\nSo many things were pointless (Luke dying. dead Yoda destroying that cool Jedi library\\, milking a whale)\\nIt was simply a terrible\\, terrible movie.  I found that I neither knew nor cared how the characters & plot fit in with all that's gone before.\\nI have seen all of the other episodes of Star Wars multiple times.  I have zero interest in ever seeing this one again.\\nI can't imagine how the last of the series could possibly get back on track?  I have scant hope that it will........but I'm going to see it anyhow!","true":true}
