Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi did for me what I never expected. This film changed the way I saw Star Wars. The Force evolving in such a unique way\\, the mythology of the Force\\, and an end battle that gave me chills.\\n\\nI don't care how many people hate me for this\\, I think The Last Jedi is a masterpiece.","true":true}
