Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a joke of a film\\, Disney have ruined the franchise\\, worst Star Wars film I have ever seen \\, never going to the cinema again to see a Star Wars movie\\, one star for spelling Star Wars right","true":true}
