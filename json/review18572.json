Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It leaves you like you just witnessed a blockbuster\\, but with a nagging feeling of emptiness:  or rather\\, there is no audience emotional involvement in any of it.\\n\\nTo start\\, we let's take Phasma.  The character survives the last movie\\, only to be used as a prop for a Finn duel.  That's it.  Then she dies\\, unless there is another comic made to tell the tale of how she escapes death yet again.  Here's the deal: phasma does not represent more than a sideline villain\\, there is no emotional struggle between Finn and her\\, she doesn't represent anything other than the bad guy Finn hates the most.\\n\\nA bit above Phasma's character development is Snoke.  All powerful snoke who is defeated without any real struggle or life-altering stakes that the audience can really cling on to.  Already there are fan theories that Snoke was simply force projecting like Luke\\, but that misses the point: the film failed to engage the audience in any meaningful way so that the death meant something tangible at an emotional level.  In the end\\, it's a scene that leaves a bland feeling that is covered up with Rey and Kylo briefly joining forces.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker:  as a fan of Star Wars lore\\, I understand that Luke has transcended into a very powerful force ghost (see yoda).  But why not give the scene more muscle?  Why not let the audience know what's happening through the eyes of Luke?  We get to see Rey face herself in the mirrors\\, why can't we see Luke's final acceptance of the balance and his willingness to cross over?  The fact that I has to think about it after the movie was done rather than enjoy it as part of the story-telling is dissapointing.\\n\\nThankfully some aspects of the movie were enjoyable:  Leia and Poe's mentor-student relationship was very well executed.  Poe makes decisions that we the audience actually feel the reprecussions of because they dictate the direction of the plot. When Leia comes back\\, she has her \\\"i told you so\\\" moment\\, and shows Poe the value of true leadership.  When Poe makes his decision to retreat and leads everyone to the cave exit\\, his personal journey and growth are complete\\, and the audience FEELS it. Leia confirms it with her sassy\\, \\\"what are you looking at me for.\\\"  It was great.\\n\\nThe rest of the characters\\, however\\, move from action scene to action scene\\, victims of their circumstance instead of driving the adventure forward. \\n\\nRey's character gets a pass since she was stuck trying to convince Luke to help\\, but even her parallel journey a-la Luke's stay in Degobah didn't include as big a reveal as when Vader tells Luke he is his father.  Kylo tells her about her parents\\, but the moment is nowhere near as epic.  Her soul is not crushed\\, and she does not\\, like Luke\\, seemingly choose death over living with the revelation of her parents.\\n\\nSome say the movie is about destroying expectations and \\\"the past.\\\"  That's fine\\, but the story could have been told in a way that the movie was enjoyable as a stand-alone.  As it is\\, it feels like a filler-episode in an otherwise great saga.","true":true}
