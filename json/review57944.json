Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What movie were the critics watching? Some pretty scenes\\, but The Last Jedi had terrible plotting\\, tone deaf comedy\\, and negative character development.\\nI can't say it's the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, but it's the first one I've actively disliked.  FWIW\\, I really liked TFA and the new trilogy it seemed to be setting up.","true":true}
