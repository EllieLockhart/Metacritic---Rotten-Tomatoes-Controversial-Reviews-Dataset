Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Omg.. that movie had three different endings.. it felt as though the writers took 5 different scripts and couldn't decide which was best so they took elements of a lot of different stories then tied them into one.  There were several \\\"jump the shark\\\" scenes that felt unnecessary but probably were there just to keep the story together.  SO disjointed.. I defy anyone to make sense of the major gaps and contradictions in the film.  It gets you cheering for one set of characters then makes you doubt their purpose and in the end there really are no heroes.. was that supposed to be the point??  Ugh..","true":true}
