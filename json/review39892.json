Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far one of the best Star Wars movies I've experienced.  I felt like a kid again watching this.  I laughed\\, cried\\, was shocked\\, cheered\\, felt thrilled - so many emotions while watching this.  The beauty of it is that it's a subtle nod to the OT and Prequels.  For deep fans of the franchise they'll get it; no explanation necessary.  For casual fans\\, it may be hard to digest.  But don't be fooled; this is a real fans movie.  Sure there were some very minor things that I would've liked to see in my head\\, but I would've never guessed what happened.  That's the brilliance of it.  I think truly great art will have a divided audience which is what we're seeing here.  I think time will tell how brilliant this film is.  Can't wait to see it again!","true":true}
