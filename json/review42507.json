Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing! I still am trying to get what the negative backlash is all about. It totally completed several characters stories and was ready to start on a new path with new people. While it\u2019s not the best of the eight it ranks for sure in the top three. Can\u2019t wait to see it again. Go see it and gather your own opinion. Enjoy! ","true":true}
