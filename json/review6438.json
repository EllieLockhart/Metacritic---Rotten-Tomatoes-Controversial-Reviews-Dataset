Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney think tank :- every setup in the previous movie be damned.  lets make everything unexpected for the sake of shock value!  let's mutilate the character story arc for the sake of drama and political commentary. if there are big plot holes worry not\\, we'll cover it with beautiful cinematography\\, CGI and action scenes non will be the wiser.","true":true}
