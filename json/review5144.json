Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Damn I am quite disappointed by this installment. Many plot lines that were built up from The Force Awakens were simply thrown out the window. Two prominent antagonist died in the most retarded ways. The movie has several big plot holes and several quite cringy moments such as Leia flying through space or Rey beating Luke and the Imperial Guard with ZERO training.\\n\\nAlso Luke's character was abysmal. From throwing his father's lightsaber behind his back at the start to becoming one with the force out of no where with no context or anything at the end of the movie.\\n\\nThe high ratings given by critics at metacritic and rottentomatoes are extremely suspicious. Did the critics get paid for those praising reviews.......?","true":true}
