Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler Free Star Wars The Last Jedi review: I'm in serious mental stress on converting to a Trekie. You know those sports fans that get so passionate after an upset game they burn police cars and break shop windows? I can now relate. You remember when people were youtubeing videos of themselves destroying their Kurig? I want to do that and I don't even know what Kurig has to do with the Last Jedi. You know the white trash that you blocked from Facebook because their misspelled drama was just too much? I want to send them all friend requests with apology letters and read all their old posts that I've missed over the years.  Do you remember how we hated the prequels and trash talked George Lucas? I want to write an apology letter\\, watch the prequels with a new appreciation and weep like a single girl on prom night.","true":true}
