Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is not only the lamest Star Wars movie ever made\\, it is simply a garbage movie.  I persisted and gave this movie two Cinema viewings\\, hoping my experience would somehow change but alas I was left bereft and bewildered at the poor and inconsistent plot\\, failures to expand upon characters and storylines setup in the previous movie\\, and the woeful attempts at slapstick humour.\\n\\nWhilst production levels such as cinematography and sound engineering is very good in this movie these technical attributes can in no way make up for this movies inconsistent tone\\, pacing issues\\, and just plan poor story telling.\\n\\nLawrence Kasdan and JJ Abrams\\, and associated creatives\\, wrote and produced a far superior and thoughtful Star Wars film in the Force Awakens.  Yes\\, The Force Awakens with its reboot notions of a New Hope was peculiar...but the film was well crafted and positioned many potential plot lines and characters to be easily expanded upon in the next 2 films of this 40 year and a 9 film saga.\\n\\nSuch a shame\\, and so very disappointing\\, to see 40 years of cinema history treated this way.","true":true}
