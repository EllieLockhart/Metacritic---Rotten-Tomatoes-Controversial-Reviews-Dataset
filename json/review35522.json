Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has proved two things to me.\\n\\n1. Rotten Tomatoes is not a credible source for film review. There is no way this film is a (currently) 90% production.\\n\\n2. Disney has no idea what to do with this new trilogy. Honestly. How did they get it so wrong?","true":true}
