Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the best film of the sequel trilogy and the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. A nuanced\\, compelling drama of a nobody girl from nowhere trying to find her place in the galaxy; a spiteful\\,  powerful young man burdened by his legacy and the phantoms of the past; a reluctant \\\"legend\\\"\\, and a small band of freedom fighters desperately trying to survive the onslaught of a rising evil. . .","true":true}
