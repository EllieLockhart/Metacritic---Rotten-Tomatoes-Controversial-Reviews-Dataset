Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horribly scripted by Lucas Films Disney. Luke should have fought in the film\\, perhaps fighting Snoke vs. the crap that happened. Also Phasma should have been more of a bad ass\\, for whatever reason they keep making this character out to be weak\\, Fin should have died\\, or Poe should have died\\, pick one\\, they are the same character. The only thing they got right about this film was Rey and Kylo.\\n\\nLastly the entire Casino Planet thing was pointless... they rescued a bunch of horse dogs\\, but left those 6-7 kids in slavery? Not sure what the hell that was about.\\n\\nAlso where is Lando and Boba Fett? Still waiting on these two characters to show up\\, but given that we have one film left I don't see how Disney can fix all of the story issues created by this horrible script and roll out new characters in the span of a single film.","true":true}
