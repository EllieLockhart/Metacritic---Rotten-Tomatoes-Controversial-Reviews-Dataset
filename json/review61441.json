The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Overall\\, it's not a bad game\\, but not a good one either.\rIn my opinion\\, the story is decent\\, not nearly as good as the first game's story\\, but still ok. The biggest flaw it has is the presentation and the order the events are shown in.\rAbby is a decent character\\, and to be honest I found myself more invested in her story than in Ellie's mainly because she doesn't appear as just a character dominated by one single wish which is to take revenge\\, although I must admit that they forced you a bit too much to care for her. Her killing Joel would have been better if the players knew who she was and why she did it first\\, instead of her showing up out of nowhere and bam\\, Joel's now dead.\rI'm really bothered by the fact that Joel was reduced to having two appearances before dying\\, which is a horrible decision. Why not show the flashbacks first and tell the story chronologically? Just a horrible decision overall.\rAlso\\, I didn't find myself caring about any of the new characters they introduced besides Abby\\, which was because they shoved the fact that you must care about her for the story to work\\, and all the deaths in this game carry nothing with them\\, not even a trace of significance for the plot or the characters.\rAlso\\, what's with all the SJW stuff in the game\\, like all the male characters that matter to the story besides Tommy and Lev dying until the end? They were just not necessary and they don't bring anything to the game besides pleasing hardcore feminists or whatever.\rThe character development for Ellie is just a mess. Besides the final farm scenes where she maybe kinda tries to walk away from what happened for what felt like 5 minutes\\, she's just a bland character obsessed with revenge.\rThe gameplay\\, although it doesn't bring many new stuff to the first game's gameplay\\, was more fun mainly because the fights were more satisfying\\, and you have more ways to play the game in a stealth fashion with craftable silencers and bows that are straightforward to aim with.\rScavenging is pretty fun\\, although a bit excessive at times\\, with the absurd amount of safes that you have to find codes for.\rThe graphics\\, environment and voice acting are just amazing\\, no other way to put it.\r\rOverall\\, it's certainly not a bad game\\, but the story is just a mess in the way it's presented and gameplay can feel a bit exhausting at times.\r\rTL DR :\rGraphics - 10\/10\rGameplay - 8\/10\rStory - 4\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
