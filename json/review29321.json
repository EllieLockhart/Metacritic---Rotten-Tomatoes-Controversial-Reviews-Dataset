Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Disney managed to do what George Lucas couldn't do which is to completely destroy Star Wars and sanitize it to a child-friendly commercial filled with political propaganda. It has now become a sad exericse of ticking the box and it is truly disgusting. They don't care how they destroy star wars as long as the money keeps rolling in. The Last Jedi is not a 'film'\\, its a big middle finger to anyone wanting to watch an exception film - instead we get a half-baked comedy filled with scenes to waste 2.45 hours of your time. Thank you\\, Disney\\, for ending the franchise to millions. I hope your company rots to hell.","true":true}
