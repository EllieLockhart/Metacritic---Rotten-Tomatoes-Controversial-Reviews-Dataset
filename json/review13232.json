Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the haters nor do I care to. I've seen Episode IV over 150 times and have well over 300 total viewings in the Star Wars universe. I've collected the toys\\, read the books\\, played the games\\, etc.\\n\\nThis is an excellent movie that fits well into the Star Wars universe. It is quite funny at times and it is quite dark at times. Quite honestly\\, it is easily in my top 3 Star Wars movies (Ep. IV\\, Ep. V\\, and now Ep. VIII). \\n\\nNow for a spoiler that's not a spoiler. This movie hints that the Resistance is similar to\\, but softer than\\, Antifa. The First Order acts in a way similar to the extremists at the edge of the alt-right. \\n\\nThis is the reason for many of the poor reviews here. The movie reviews by movie experts have been overwhelmingly positive. All of my Star Wars loving friends (who happen to be liberal or moderate politically) have loved it as well.\\n\\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that professional reviewers offer valid reasons why they loved (or\\, in a few instances\\, hated) this movie. Do not let a deliberate and coordinated assault here dissuade you from watching a good movie. I\\, and many others\\, believe you'd be missing out on something pretty cool.","true":true}
