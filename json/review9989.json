Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film! Maybe not as great as Empire but easily the 2nd best Star Wars film. Great action(saber battle with emperial guards was epic!)\\, great story\\, great drama\\, and a great tribute-to Carrie Fisher. Everyone in my family loved it from our 8 year old to our teenager and both myself and my wife!","true":true}
