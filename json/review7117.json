Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enghh. A lot of subplots left open in this one that just made things disappointing. This movie could have been condensed as well\\, a tad long. Too much going on too quickly but Mark Hamill was great and probably the saving grace for this film. They need better script writers at this point. I mean it wasn't terrible and a few moments did shine but overall they can do better than this.","true":true}
