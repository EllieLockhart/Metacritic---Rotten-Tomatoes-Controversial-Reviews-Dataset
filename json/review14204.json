Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get its Disney but Leia flying like Mary Poppins ? \\nShe never used or showed any powers before. \\nAnd everytime the ratings on this gets lower all the sudden \\nIn a flash there is a wave of praise for it. Every Abrams movie does this\\nGets you excited ya dart off to see it and are disappointed the only otger consistency in JJ movies is that somewhere Greg Grunberg will show up. \\nI really think they need to give Simon Pegg a crack at the story with Kevin Smith. Not like Disney has anything to lose.","true":true}
