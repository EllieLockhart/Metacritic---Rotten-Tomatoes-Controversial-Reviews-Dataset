The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have never written a review on metacritic before\\, but due to this game's controversy\\, and it being review bombed\\, I feel like I should write one now that I finished it. I'm no writer\\, so I'm sorry if my review isn't particularly well written.\rIt took me around 25 hours to finish it\\, spending a lot of time exploring as much as I could.\r\rThe short\\, spoiler free review is:\r\rThe game is amazing! It's hard to play like some movies are hard to watch. It's uncomfortable\\, it kept me on the edge of my seat for most of it and I really love it.\rPlay if for yourself\\, borrow a copy if you are afraid you might not like it\\, but I can't imagine someone not liking it. Yes\\, things happened in the story that made me angry and sad\\, but a good story doesn't only have things the audience wants.\rI truly believe this game deserves a 10\\, but I understand not everyone will agree with me. That being said\\, I can't imagine anyone giving this game less than a 6. A 6 would be the score if the person absolutely hates cinematic and\/or survival games\\, but if you hate this kind of games then you shouldn't be playing it.\r\rThe longer\\, with some spoilers review follows (SPOILERS!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)\r\rI avoided any spoilers before playing the game. Even trying to avoid them I knew people were pissed because the antagonist is trans (although I can't understand why that's a reason for someone to be pissed) but I didn't know any details. Well\\, the game really does have a trans character\\, but it is not the antagonist like people assumed. People though Abby was trans\\, but she is just really buffed. There is another character that is trans\\, I really enjoyed his journey\\, but now I wonder if there were two separate leaks\\, one saying there is a trans character and another showing Abby with the gold club and people just made a wrong assumption.\r\rAnyway\\, I really enjoyed the way the story is structured. It uses it's two protagonists to show the player the same events through different lenses. I hated a character in the beginning\\, then later loved them because I got to see things in a different way. I got really pissed at characters I've always loved\\, but I \\\"forgave\\\" then once they found redemption. Everyone is the hero on their own story.\r\rThe first game had some \\\"nice\\\" and \\\"light\\\" moments (like the giraffes)\\, and this one does too\\, but on this game those moments are mostly flashbacks and memories. The present of the protagonists sucks most of the time\\, they are always under pressure\\, fighting for their and for their loved ones lives.\r\rThe game is good I get why some people are angry even after playing it\\, hell I'm angry at the game\\, but It's still really good\\, it's supposed to make you angry\\, it reminds us that everyone has their own story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
