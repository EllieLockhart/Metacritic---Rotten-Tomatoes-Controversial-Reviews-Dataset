Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"boring\\, stupid\\, enraging. the entire movie saga has built up the idea of throwing away the past and starting a new future. but instead\\, because disney realizes this means they can't sell jedi toys anymore\\, they completely do a 180 in the last 10 minutes of the movie. Now it's a battle of good vs evil again. why? Why did you do this?\\n\\nnow let's talk about \\\"subverting expectations\\\". If this movie actually accomplished what it was leading up to\\, then it would successfully subvert expectations and result in something amazing and new.\\n\\nbut nooooo\\, these idiots think \\\"subverting expectations\\\" means that you don't write a real conclusion to anything. every plot point will instead result in a \\\"nope\\\" like charlie brown missing the football and falling on his back. i cannot enjoy anything about this movie because now it's just annoying.\\n\\ni wasted my time and money on this gross misuse of a decades-long FRANCHISE. sorry disney\\, you failed to shove star wars through a mold to make it like marvel movies. this isn't marvel.\\n\\nI'm voting this 1 star because rotten tomatoes does not calculate half-star ratings into the audience score. if you look at the actual audience ratings\\, you'll see an incredible amount of half-star reviews\\, but the \\\"average rating\\\" is still 2.9 out of 5. why is this? it's because in a lame attempt at blocking automated bot attacks\\, you've just blocked out the opinions of the majority. now instead of real people giving their feedback\\, you have bloated art \\\"critics\\\" pasting their pre-made review to praise this dumpster fire manufactured for two year olds.","true":true}
