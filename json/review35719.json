Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a very underwhelming and incongruous addition to the Star Wars series. The Marvel-esque \\\"that's gotta hurt\\\" quipping that followed every epic moment\/explosion diffused so much of the drama and felt cheap\\, lazy and completely out of place. The portrayal of Luke seemed mishandled\\, tarnished with the aforementioned wisecracking -\u00a0a far cry from his character in previous films. A trip to a casino planet was horribly designed and realised\\, more like Star Trek than Star Wars  -\u00a0complete with an unfunny CGI skit involving an anonymous gnome and BB8. Killing off Snoke was a baffling decision and ruined all of his ominous build up in The Force Awakens. Fans of the film will say this is a \\\"brave\\\" departure with \\\"new\\\" ideas - for me\\, it simply made The Last Jedi feel more like a Marvel film and less special. Very disappointed and I hope that Disney see this as a misstep in retrospect.","true":true}
