Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Have to agree with others: There's something ROTTEN about Rotten Tomatoes' score for this film!  \\nI can't prove critics were bribed but the *audience* score is CLEARLY lower than 50%\\n\\n1\/2 star and 1 star reviews outnumber positive ones so overwhelmingly\\, it should be around 20% \\n \\nAlso\\, isn't it a bit suspicious that the majority of 5 star reviews are so brief and generic??\\nHuffPost put about the \\\"anonymously sourced\\\" rumour that the 1 star reviews were bots. (Even though\\, most include clear\\, specific reasons for disliking the film.)  That rumour was quickly debunked. But now\\, it appears to have been a cover for fake 5 star reviews!","true":true}
