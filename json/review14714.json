Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never worked so hard to like or understand a movie. The more I want TLJ the more I hate it. The story or director suffers from the Dunning-Kruger effect. Rian Johnson has a cognitive bias in which he believes that he is smarter and more capable than he really is. Essentially\\, he does not possess the skills needed to recognize his own incompetence with this film. There's fan films out there with better plots. In short\\, this is the worst Star Wars movie ever made.","true":true}
