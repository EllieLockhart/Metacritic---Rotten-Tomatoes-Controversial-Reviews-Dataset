Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely disagree with many people who dislike the movie. Short and sweet is there are some parts you would like done better\\, aspects of story that are just unanswered\\, and a few odd parts\\, but all that aside the movie was funny at points\\, great fight scenes\\, and as a mild fan boy of Star Wars not as big as some people but way more than many people\\, it is not a disappointment. I need to see movies like this 3+ times to have a final opinion\\, if you are same type my opinion is a good movie\\, not great.","true":true}
