Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Average rating 3.3?  What the hell\\, are you people on crack?  This movie was AWESOME.  In case you were unaware\\, good films subvert your expectations\\, not just fulfill them.  Honestly\\, if all you wanted was more of the same you should have stayed at home\\, ordered a pizza and watched Empire again.  This movie was great.  Not better than Empire (maybe nothing ever will be)\\, but absolutely worth your time.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is not to be trusted.","true":true}
