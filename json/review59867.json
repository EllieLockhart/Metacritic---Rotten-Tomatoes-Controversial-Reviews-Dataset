The story jumps all around the story's time line which isn't confusing but it distracts you enough from the new characters that you just don't feel connected to any of them. As a sequel it looses touch with the first game and the characters feel like they all suddenly became retarded out of nowhere. A game with good mechanics and graphics but a very poorly executed and terribly written story is a bad game in the end if it leaves you unsatisfied in the end then it's a bad game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
