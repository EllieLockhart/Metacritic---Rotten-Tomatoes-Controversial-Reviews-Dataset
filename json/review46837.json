Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well... that sucked. Did Rian Johnson just take the force awakens and say how can I ruin every back story and character so that there is nothing left... not only ruining this movie but also the original trilogy. May the force be with J.J. Abrams... he\u2019s the last person in the making of Star Wars that the fans might still like","true":true}
