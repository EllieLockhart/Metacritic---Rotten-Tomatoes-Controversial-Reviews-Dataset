Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"bitch Vader becomes mega bitch Vader by being a bigger bitch. this whole movie would of ended in an hour with thousands of rebels living if  fin and fins love interest  (idk her name cuz who real gives crap about the new characters) sat on their ass and didn't do anything. yet\\, they didn't so bitch luke (they killed luke character so bitch luke is his new name) has to save the rebals gang by pulling a old Ben on bitch Vader. so if you like a plot that contradicts itself and its source material then you'll like the last bitch Jedi.","true":true}
