Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney have just taken a massive dump all over George Lucas' creation. The real Star Wars ended in 2005 with Revenge of the Sith.

Not even sure how he discovered that one","true":true}
