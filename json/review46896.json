Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went and took the kids and wife to this last night\\, as a huge fan of the original 3 films growing up (not so much of the prequels) I was very satisfied how the story played out. I am also looking forward to the continuation of the story with the next part and closing out this part of the series.","true":true}
