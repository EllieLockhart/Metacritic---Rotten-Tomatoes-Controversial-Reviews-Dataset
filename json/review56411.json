Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The allegation that all the terrible user reviews are politically motivated\\, work of white supremist groups is a laughably poor excuse to explain the movie going public's disgust with reviewers who have clearly been bought off or pressured into giving poor films great reviews.\\n\\nRead the average review by an average fan-critic and they will explain the numerous lazy\\, illogical places the script leaps off the rails. Del Toro's role\\, which took up a sizeable chunk in the middle dealing with a casino\\, was a completely needless Mcguffin. The \\\"romance\\\" in this film was laughable fan boy junk. There was absolutely no attempt whatsoever to build any convincing back story (or tell one) regarding most of these characters. Virtually zero. It seemed like a rush to get in all of these different characters into the film and then consider the diverse reach and merchandising opportunities selling them.\\n\\nThis is certainly the last Jedi. The spirit and the care in crafting characters we get to know and care about is lost in this film. It's all about \\\"images\\\" - we can pit a female  white hero\\, a black hero\\, an Asian hero\\, a white knowitall\\, an alien villain without having to explain a darn thing about what magical Force it is that protects them... other than the need for a sequel. Shame on Disney. This is what passes for a 4.5 star movie these days.","true":true}
