Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It tries too hard to be 3\\, 5\\, and 6\\, but forgets its 8. I had never been more solely disapointed in a star wars film since episode 2. Not only does it NOT feel like Star Wars\\, it just feels like the guardians of the galaxy 2.3.\\nPowerful moments ruined by awkward comedy. Very confusing character motives\\, and a confusing story made me want to walk out of the middle of the film. It drags itself so hard it made me wish it ended faster.\\nI will no longer excuse it like i did for episode 7. It feels more like a remake than episode 7. I hold high standards for star wars and this movie was low par.\\n\\nI did like the special effects and the action was great\\, but in my opinion\\, SE only represents 1 star of any movie\\, the other 4 needs to be earned by story and music\\, which\\, music ques and scores represent the half star of this review.\\n\\nImportant characters are killed off for no reason when they could be used in future installments\\, and as much as i love Mark's comedic scenes\\, 50% feel out of place.\\n\\nI can go on and on about how this movie failed me as a die hard Star wars fanatic\\, but if i did\\, it would crash the internet. So\\, the end. I'm not seeing this movie a second time.","true":true}
