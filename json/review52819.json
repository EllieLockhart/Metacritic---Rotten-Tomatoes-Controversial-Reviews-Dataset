Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of missed opportunities to explain things they set up in episode 7. Why do a build up as if certain pieces of information are important\\, only to find out they actually aren't? This new trilogy with the old & new cast can't seem to decide if I wants to be nostalgic or do something brand new.","true":true}
