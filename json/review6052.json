Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. I'm glad Carrie Fisher didn't have to see what Rian Johnson did to her. Still disagree with how Johnson also utilised Mark at the end of the film. It's sad what Disney are doing to the Star Wars franchise","true":true}
