Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson has taken some risks here\\, some of it works\\, some of it doesn't but overall I did really enjoy this film and I'm keen to watch it again.  First the bad\\, the whole casino section is so bad.  It feels like it's taken from a different film and adds nothing.  Also the whole flying Leia section and her miraculous survival is almost cringey to watch.  Anyway to the good...  The Rey\/Ren relationship was really interesting and wrapped up in this we have Luke's conflicts as a teacher and mentor.  His short scene with Yoda was probably my favourite bit\\, some actual deep emotion and not just trading on nostalgia.  We have a definite handover from the old films to the new characters here which is handled well and some new characters like Rose also promise some interesting stories to come.  Rey's lineage is answered in a unique way (or is it?)\\, interesting to see what they do with Leia in the next film now that Fisher has died as well.  There's a lot covered and as such there seems to be extra moments of humour and creatures like the Porgs.  Some seem to have hated that but I thought it was needed and keeps the films open to a wider audience.  I look forward to watching it again\\, I might just close my eyes when 'Super Leia' takes off across the screen though.","true":true}
