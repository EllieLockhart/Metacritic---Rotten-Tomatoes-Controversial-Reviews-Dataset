Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disappointment. Diversity is good; I love seeing minorities and women leading things as much as the next person\\, but not having such forced down our throats with zero regard to the requirements or history of the story in an attempt to be politically correct. It's crazy: bombs 'dropping' in the vacuum of space? Chewbacca prioritising the Animal Rights Movement over feeding on a new\\, hostile planet? Using just 18 hours to locate a master code breaker on an entire planet? The wanton and completely meaningless destruction of the Casino just to make 'rich people suffer'? The sappy rescuing of the sports animals on the aforementioned planet? I could go on and on. This movie was shambolic\\, disregarded the already flimsy laws of Star Wars physics\\, and was just meant to promote liberal politics and make money for Disney. How I long for the good old days of Star Wars!","true":true}
