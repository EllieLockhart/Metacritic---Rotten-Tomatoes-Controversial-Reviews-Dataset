Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the few whinging fan-boys! It's a good movie...much better than any of the prequels\\, and much more in line with the original series in quality of storytelling. Like Episode 5 (Empire)\\, it's a transitional movie. It stands well on its own in many ways\\, and I sense that it will fit well into the larger picture. There are smart\\, broad themes about the nature of heroism. Great acting\\, great effects\\, and overall the high quality in production and script that one would hope for in a Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
