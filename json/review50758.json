Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A barrel of laughs\\, truly a great comedy as we witness ineptitude on a galactic scale. Just look at that discrepancy between the critic score and the audience score! I'd also need to get paid to like this movie!\\n\\nThe previews foreshadowed something interesting happening but it all devolved into the Avengers in an even more tired\\, overdone franchise.","true":true}
