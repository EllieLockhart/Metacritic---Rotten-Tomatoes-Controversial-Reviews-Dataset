Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I loved it. I was hoping Yoda would be in it\\, and he was brought back exactly how I wanted. The opening half of the movie was weaker than the final half\\, and my only criticism is cutting between ~4 subplots became tedious.","true":true}
