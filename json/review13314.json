Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd rather watch The Clone Wars than sit through this rubbish again.  This isn't as bad as it was disappointing and confusing.  Hopefully this tired saga can survive.  The critics here have lost ALL remaining credibility by not ripping this POS apart.","true":true}
