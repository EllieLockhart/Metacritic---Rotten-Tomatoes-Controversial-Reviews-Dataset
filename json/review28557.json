Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the best Star Wars film since Empire. Full of wit\\, story\\, strong characters\\, excellent acting along with twists and turns. Anyone ranking this below three stars went in biased with expectation on what they wanted to see and can't accept anyone's vision that does not include their own personal check lists. Go in with an open mind.","true":true}
