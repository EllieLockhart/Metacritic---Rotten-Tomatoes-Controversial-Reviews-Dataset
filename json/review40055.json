Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first rotten tomatoes score ever. I am not a robot. I am  fan of starwars. Have been one since I was a child. I hated this movie. They intriduced Disney mysticism to starwars and it doesn't work...... It's so bad..... really bad. Leia should have clicked her heels before force space walking. Lukes whole who gives a shit attitude towards the force and his family set the tone for how much you really shouldn't give a shit about this movie. I am real.... Not a bot.... I agree the movie was shot beautifully. But when all you shoot is a polished turd....... why do this to starwars???? If you wanted something new then go create your own space drama. Don't split fans of a franchise that's been around longer than a contract of ownership. The only thing missing at the end? You know the Disney commercial scene. Is a Hasbro logo.... This review is just the tip of the iceberg. I haven't gone into detail. Way to split a fan base who's only disagreements were dark side and light. It's a sad day when Sith and Jedi can come together and bash a starwars movie....","true":true}
