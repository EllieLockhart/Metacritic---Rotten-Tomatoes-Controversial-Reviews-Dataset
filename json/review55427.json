Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Marvel's Star Wars. This was by far the worst Star Wars movie because it ignored everithing that made Star Wars great in order to check all the generic boxes of the last three Marvel movies. What? Humor ist popular? Ok\\, then lets add humor everywhere\\, especially in all the wrong places! Did you like Madagascar's penguins? Well\\, your in luck because their in Star Wars now! Oh\\, There are only three rebel ships left! Now two! Now one! Oh\\, there are only ten escape transporters left! Now nine! Now eight! And this literally continues small step by small step\\, until all members of the rebellion can fit into the final frame. After adding a black Storm Trooper last movie\\, what are we missing? Asians! So lets add one that dies immediately and one\\, that is great at technology and goes on a mission with the black guy\\, nods approvingly to his plans of heroism\\, saves him from dying of being too heroic\\, and kisses him before dying herself. Because there can be no mixed gender mission without love!","true":true}
