Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie you hope for is never as good as the movie you get. This movie bridged the gap between older generation of Star Wars and the newer younger Star Wars. Much like the symbolism of ying and yang\\, which this movie uses way to much\\, it had great moments and disappointing moments. ","true":true}
