Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched this piece of garbage last night. \\nHow do you take such a legacy and pay no heed to its former message and meaning. How do you destroy something so wonderful. I was so upset that I thought that I was going to be sick. Disgusting. I can only hope that this will be seen as a teenage girls fan fiction.","true":true}
