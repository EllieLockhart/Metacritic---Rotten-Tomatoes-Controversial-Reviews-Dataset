Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even Tommy Wiseau  could have made a better Star Wars then Rian Johnson. I feel as if Star Wars saga should join the #metoo movement for how bad Rian Johnson gave it the johnson.","true":true}
