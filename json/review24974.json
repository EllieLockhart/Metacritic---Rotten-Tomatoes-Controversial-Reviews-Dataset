Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"my main issue with these movie is how they handle Luke story he never lost hope on his father but he did on his nephew you look in the dictionary and Luke basically means hope\\, Oscar was great as Poe same as Daisy\\, Carrie\\, Adam\\, Mark Hamill even tho they did not care for his character he brought A+ game to the character I still can't imagine he was gonna do that no way no my LUKE\\, Boyega feels like his having ton of fun when you see him on scene but in this one the script failed him thank God he got ton of charisma\\, Phasma.....I don't know\\, Rey's parents was a big meh\\, If they plan to do that on snoke why saving him for this one just to do that\\, a lot of great HOLY SH+_+ moments that make star wars scream but that was it I dont know how to feel about this movie I was gonna see it again now I don't know","true":true}
