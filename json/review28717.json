Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Putting all the political nonsense in the movie aside\\, it just wasn't a good story. There were some outstanding backdrops and sets in this movie\\, that is the only reason I even gave it 1.5 stars. The Tomatometer gives this movie a 91%. My only guess is those reviews are coming from people trying to keep their jobs. I still am looking forward to more Star Wars content\\, but only from creators like Dave Feloni.","true":true}
