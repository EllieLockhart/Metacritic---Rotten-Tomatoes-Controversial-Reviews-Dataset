Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An exciting\\, fun\\, unique Star Wars film. The Last Jedi is a very bold film\\, Rian Johnson did something new and special. Fans of the series should be delighted by all the new things Johnson has added because I sure am.","true":true}
