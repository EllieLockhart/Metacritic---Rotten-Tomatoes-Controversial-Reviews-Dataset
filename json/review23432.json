Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved seeing the development of the characters and the departure from all good\/bad\\, black\/white\\, because people in life are shades of grey. I enjoyed seeing the different storylines\\, woven together\\, with crucial decisions and disasters in each. I loved that there wasn't a storybook easy ending to any of them. I felt the conflicts felt real and actually part of the characters and events and not just something tossed away and simple. I will miss our General\/Princess in the future\\, she was wonderful here.","true":true}
