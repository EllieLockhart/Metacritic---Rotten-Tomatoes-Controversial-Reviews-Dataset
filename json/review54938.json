Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker dies. More feminist garbage\\, more bad plots and terrible tropes. Leia survives via a force field? Snoke dies with no explanation as to who he is (just another pointless plot thread)\\, stupid porgs\\, characters we dont care about and lots of CGI. The crap Disney is turning out is low quality fan fiction. Im now done with the Star Wars franchise altogether and Ive been a die hard fan since 77. Disney needs to fire Kennedy and the entire Lucasfilm story group (6 women\\, two guys) or they can shitcan the entire franchise. I'm the old school fan with the money for Black Series and Force FX sabers...I'm not spending a dime on this new trash and I know for fact Im not the only one.","true":true}
