Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This entry in the Star Wars Saga went in all kinds of unexpected directions. I was equally surprised as well as disappointed. It\u2019s not the best of Star Wars films\\, however it contains several moments that rank near the very top. I love this franchise and \u2018The Last Jedi\u2019 has done nothing but ensure I always will. ","true":true}
