Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal plot that keeps the audience on their toes with so many twists that obliterate fan theiries\\, and the sequences are incredible in a cinematographic sense; however the characters could have been better developed and there was (despite the beautiful use of puppets) an excessive use of CGI. Overall\\, 4\/5 stars.","true":true}
