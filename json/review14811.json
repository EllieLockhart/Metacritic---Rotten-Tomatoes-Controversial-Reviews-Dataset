Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say\\, I avoided having any and all expectations for this movie\\, and it payed off. The humor might've felt a bit forced at parts\\, the entire Finn and Rose plot was useless\\, and that time could've been used to flesh out the First Order. However the music\\, the way it was shot\\, and the Rey-Luke-Kylo dynamic was great in my opinion. I understand why many people don't like this version of luke\\, but I thought seeing him as a broken man was interesting. It sure wasn't perfect\\, or even close to perfect\\, but I considered it to be enjoyable nonetheless. I don't really understand why people are saying it's the worst movie of all time.","true":true}
