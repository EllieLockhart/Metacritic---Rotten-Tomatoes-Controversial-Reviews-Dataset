Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. The scenes were all over the place and it was difficult to follow along with the characters. I felt there was no build up and there lacked chemistry between the characters. The film made an attempt to be funny\\, but it ultimately fell short. I wish they could've focused on just telling the story and stayed away from the absurdity of particular scenes. ","true":true}
