Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not much to say that has not already been said in other reviews. Sad to say that the movie was very below par and the biggest complaints were how the questions and mysteries set up in the force awakens were either dismissed or brushed away completely. Also\\, the way that two big key characters were handled was nothing short of unforgivable. This is definitely a movie aimed at a younger audience more than a mature one. I have only seen the movie once as  I found a lot of it painful and cringe-worthy to watch\\, and I don't think that seeing it again would change my mind how I feel about it. The money was there\\, the tech was there\\, the actors were there\\, but it was sadly very lacking in the storyline and plot department. We waited two long years after force awakens for this sore\\, bitter disappointment of a movie. :(","true":true}
