Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring story\\, no goal\\, no sense: nothing. Costumes and special effects are great\\, but that is not giving justice to a Star Wars movie. Very disappointing.","true":true}
