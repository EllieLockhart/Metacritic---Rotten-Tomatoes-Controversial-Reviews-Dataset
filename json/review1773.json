Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AS a Star Wars fan since the original came out I struggled with this movie immensely. I am not sure if it was the film or my expectations.  I had so many theories and was hopeful for answers.  Sadly this movie provided none.  I Have been a fan of Luke for some time and was shocked by the portrayal of  of this iconic figure.  I get him going into hiding\\, but questioning the legitimacy of the Jedi order as a whole was difficult.  There are no answers in this film\\, none\\, and the ones that are provided were a vast let down.  I wanted to love this film and after seeing it a second time\\, feel worse.  It's worth the money to see but may leave you feeling empty.","true":true}
