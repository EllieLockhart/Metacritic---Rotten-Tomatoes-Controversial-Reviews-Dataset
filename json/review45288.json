Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"* useless plot line with rose fin\\n* really there is not jedi training if you see it again\\n* phasma wasted character.\\n* leia should have stayed dead that's was stupid as hell.\\n* no explanation on the knights or Ren. Leaves you with more question then answer.\\n* snoak could have been great villain but killed pretty early\\n* Luke could have gone out more bad ass.\\n*Rey really did not grow as a character.\\n* Chewie was left in the background only about 3 showings for like 30 seconds.\\n*story line was kinda dumb. \\\" We are running out of fuel and first order is going to kill us\\\".\\n* movie was all over the place with no clear time line.\\n* director ignored from previous films including Lore from previous movies.","true":true}
