Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've got a bad for feeling about this.. How true that quote came to be for The last Jedi.. Incoming spoilers.. \\n\\nThe credits rolled I had to slap my self in the face a few times  to make sure what I had witnessed was real. \\n\\nLeia suddenly has superman powers.. the books that built the foundation of the jedi order worthless let\\, No need to train for years with a lightsaber\\,  anyone can use them it seems. We discover the origins of Reys family after theorising for months and months .. That was fantastic story wasn't it.. Luke Skywalkers character and legacy cast aside like a used tissue.. There was so much crap in this movie that didn't make sense\\, I understand Disney is trying to meet a wide diversity of people\\, but it didn't feel like Starwars\\, It felt like a Disney action movie.\\n\\nWe finally get the reveal of Snoke\\, hyped up in the first movie an evil lord of the darkside\\, only to be taken out with some basic force manipulation. They should of done Kylo in.. I mean for someone who is suppose to be a powerful darkside user\\, he comes across as an angry teenager who's dad has just grounded him for whining to much.. For one they should of kept his mask on\\, at least he a degree of intimidation. I\\n\\nIt just makes me wonder what Disney is thinking when they think Starwars? I mean the only half decent attempt was when Luke walked out in front of the ATATs and was about to take care of business only for that to be cocked up a few mins later. He wasn't even there\\, Force ghost second movie really Disney? At least give one of staples of starwars a bit of respect\\, Luke Skywalker is not a random stormtrooper taking a blaster bolt. \\n\\nI need to give Agent J call so I can get a flash of the nerurlizer to wipe this crap from my memory.","true":true}
