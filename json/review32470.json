Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars movies are made by their villains in this movie we are shown a group of bumbling idiotic \\\"bad guys\\\". You are never made to believe for even a moment that the so called villains are actually anything of a threat. This removes almost all the tension in the movie at no point do ever fear what will become of my heroes. The heroes prevail not because of their strength\\, but instead because of the incompetence of the villain. At points during the movie you feel like you are sitting through a horror movie screaming at teenaged girl not to open the closet\\, but instead you're yelling at the villains \\\"oh my god just shoot all ready\\\". I could have beaten these villains with a jar full of sand and a wooden stick.","true":true}
