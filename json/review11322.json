Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrendous... all of the questions from The Force Awakens received terrible answers (nothing exciting\\, profound\\, or compelling). The answers given made me care even less for the new heroes of the galaxy.  The characters each had a tag line\\, which they repeated as nauseam. The movie moves at such an erratic pace I never felt a real sense of urgency. It takes the original heroes and tosses them away like trash\\, and the new heroes all have lots of maturing to do (even though this is the second movie). The ending leaves me as far from excited for Episode IX as I could possibly be\\, in fact I wouldn't notice if it never gets made. \\n\\nThis movie gets a star because of the nostalgia buttons it hits.","true":true}
