Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not worth a second viewing. They killed so many characters so they could have a new \u00a8rebellion\u00a8 and the lightsaber effects was really bad\\, especially that last fight. Some effects were cool but most of it looked like a video game\\, Yoda should've been cgi because that puppet looked horrible. The overall plot is still a bit fuzzy to me. I won't compare it to other SW movies but this is not something i'd like to see again.","true":true}
