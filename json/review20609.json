Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've read a lot of reviews comparing the plot holes and acting in this movie to the prequels and I agree.  Rose is the new Jar Jar and there is some really bad acting.  \\n\\nI just want to add that I thought Superman Lea was as cringe worthy a scene as when Vader yells \\\"Nooo\\\" at the end of Revenge of the Sith.","true":true}
