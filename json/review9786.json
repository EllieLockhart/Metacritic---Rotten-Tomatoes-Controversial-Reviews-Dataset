Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Go watch it again. I feel like people hate on this movie for no reason. It felt incomplete without Rise of Skywalker\\, but now that the trilogy is done\\, this movie fits into the other two quite well. Rian Johnson did well with this one. I notice a trend\\, people either hate this or love it. There's no \\\"like\\\". I love it. It reminds me of Empire Strikes Back\\, as Luke no longer wants to train Jedi like Yoda didn't\\, and a force ghost has to appear and convince them to help. Hell\\, Luke is a better helper in this than Yoda was in the OT. His death was honorable\\, and wise\\, too.","true":true}
