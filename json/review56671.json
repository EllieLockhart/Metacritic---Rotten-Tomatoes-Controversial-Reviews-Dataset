Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was beautiful. I laughed\\, I cheered\\, and I cried\\, and I screamed. It was a wild ride of so many emotions with great characters. Props to Mark Hamill\\, his performance was spectacular! It took risks and it was different from the original trilogy and there were so many twists and turns. I won't go into spoiler territory but I was shocked on multiple occasions. This is a very character driven story and I can see how some of the narrative flaws can turn some people off. I also know some people didn't care for the humor but for me nearly every joke landed. The contrast between the dramatic moments and the funny moments made both of them stronger! I absolutely LOVED the Last Jedi and I can't wait to see it again!","true":true}
