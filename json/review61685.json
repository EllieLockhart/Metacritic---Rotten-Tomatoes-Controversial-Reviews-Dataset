Not because of how she looks\\, or what sex she is. I don't care how many dogs the game makes you pet in it's weak attempts to make you like her.\r\rIt shows a lot about how pathetic I am I guess\\, but it's been five days\\, and my day is still ruined. Maybe it's because they outright said that fans of the first game might hate this one? Who knows.\r\rThis game is very pretty\\, but it's sort of like putting a cute snapchat filter on your arm that was just torn off. It certainly looks nicer than it would without it\\, but gosh darnit this is certainly a pile of trash. A painful pile of trash.\r\rThey destroyed the first game in an attempt to tell a blatantly obvious message of 'revenge bad' (unless you're Abby\\, then revenge is perfectly fine). They tried to be artistic\\, and in the process managed to throw the love and adoration the fans of the first game had for Joel and Ellie in the trash. And then burn the trash. And then spit on the charred trash.\r\rAnd finally\\, once they finished spitting on the charred pile of trash that is Ellie and Joel\\, they walked away with hundreds of awards for being the best at spitting on burnt trash. Then they took all the money and awards the garbage bin gave them(while it is a very pretty garbage bin\\, with lots of flowers and high resolution) and used it to buy a pretty crown. Now that the game is finally out\\, they at last get to put the trash crown on their heads\\, that the art designers earned for them. But hey\\, what worth does a stupid fan have when you can get a cool crown\\, some pretty '100's' and a truck full of money?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
