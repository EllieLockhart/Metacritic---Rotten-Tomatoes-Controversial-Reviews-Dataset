Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe people with these terrible reviews. It's the same crowd trying to use the Jedi mind trick to make us think the DC movies are good. They just want a xerox copy of the original trilogy. Just go down into your mom's basement and watch those movies\\, stay away from children and the sunshine\\, and get off the internet. Those of us who have seen a boob in real life\\, will love this movie. It's well written\\, has great characters and a fresh story but still holds on to the Star Wars feel. \\n\\nPS everyone in my sold out theater\\, roared into applause at the end and a few times throughout the movie. The real public is loving this movie.","true":true}
