Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish this film could have been better. Truth it\\, I personally did not enjoy it. Lousy storytelling and stale characters. Subpar visuals that make the prequels feel like masterpieces. Very sloppy pacing and very sloppy exposition. The first three films and the prequels explore the culture of the galaxy\\, a great selection of settings--Naboo\\, Taooine\\, Coruscant\\, Hoth\\, etc. The films take the time to introduce you to the people inhabiting these planets and in return\\, these planets force the characters to develop and adapt to the environment. Rather\\, that element is missing here. The entire thing is disjointed and structurally flimsy. I should have saved my money and waited for it to be available on a streaming service. The best part of the film is BB-8. He has a few memorable moments.","true":true}
