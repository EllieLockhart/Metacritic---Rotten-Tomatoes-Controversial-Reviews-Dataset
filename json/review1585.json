Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a livid Star Wars fan\\, this movie did not disappoint.  Fears of an \\\"Empire Clone\\\" were immediately casted away.  While the movie takes a while to get rolling\\, everything is set up for moments more intense than have ever been seen in the franchise.  The soundtrack is spectacular\\, as always!  The choice of how characters were created was great\\, as was a super secret guest appearance.   There are moments that make you say \\\"oh my god...\\\"\\, and opens up the story greatly for future Star Wars films\\, perhaps this story even beyond Episode IX (though I do hope they wrap this up by then).  You will question everything\\, from the Jedi\\, to the First order\\, to the Resistance\\, and you'll definitely need to see this a second time!","true":true}
