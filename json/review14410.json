Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had no emotional connection to this movie and I was stuck considering plot holes and nonsensical narrative choices. I find it odd that people like this movie as nobody in my packed theater was laughing at the jokes\\, reacting to the action\\, or responded to the ending. I heard some people start to react to what they thought might happen only to have the plot twist contradict their expectations.\\n\\nImportant note: Nothing in the movie will make any sense if you don't already have a strong grasp of the Star Wars storyline.","true":true}
