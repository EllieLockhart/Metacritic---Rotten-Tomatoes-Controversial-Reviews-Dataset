Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics contempt for fans critique of TLJ demonstrates the disdain and arrogance of the self serving industries full of back slapping agendas. The fans few us the purist views\\, they have no agendas and call it as they see it. TLJ is a monumental screw up whether you believe in cannon or not. It's a woeful film without the whitewashing or massacre of jedi mythologies. This was not borne out of the lust for change\\, new direction I hear. It was born out of incompetence\\, it's wasn't about fulfilling fan theories it was a failure of actually telling a story\\, poor narrative and character arcs\\, pathetic dialogue and characters behaving in unorthodox ways. The Force awakens set up a perfect scenario on a platter but Rian ruined it\\, frankly beyond repair \\nKey embarrassing concerns:\\nLuke throws away Lightsaber\\, he wouldn't disrespect the sacred weapon of the Jedi regardless of his current feelings\\, it was done for a cheap gag. First signs things were wrong\\nHe calls it a Lazersword = impossible\\nShips now gave Fuel anxiety\\, since when\\, fhel or lack of gave never been an issue especially in last minute hyper space jaunts = poor knowledge\\nPrincess suddenly finds the force after 65years and now can float through space like Mary Poppins = gringworthy\\nChewys jobs s to kick ass\\, throw around stormtroopers and use his crossbow = wasted character\\nSnoke? What was the point in inventing a character\\, who was actually quite interesting and shows his superior jedi powers yet he can't see a Lightsaber strike 2 ft away = it doesn't add up\\nGreat flashback of Knights of Ren assault on Luke\\, wasted opportunity\\, same flashback of Luke in brown beard\\, copied and pasted twice to timelines as he suddenly feels threatened by his sleeping nephew\\, dwhen do the knights of Ren become a group = pointless bullshit\\nFinns whole journey and chemistry with his partner = pointless\\nChaptain Phasma = pointless\\nRey family timelines\\, parentage cones to nothing\\, again another failure of resolving a timelines\\, narrative thread through sheer incompetence \\nNew jedi powers = now Jim Henson puppet Yoda can burn down temples by flick of finger\\, now ghosts can interact with real world\\, so obi wan etc missed many opportunities to hurt the emperor previously\\, ah well\\nLuke x-wing was shown\\, obviously to be pulled out of the water to perform some kind of final act\\, nah can't be bothered with that \\nKylo can't see that Luke hasn't aged in 10years\\, wow look at that great brown hair and beard\\, fire when ready \\nI could go\\, what's the point\\, it was a cock up of monumental proportions and Disney\\, Rian\\, frightened critics refuse to tell the truth and are living in denial.","true":true}
