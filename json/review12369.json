Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am yet another person who registered an account just to review this movie\\, as I am still dumbfounded how it was written\\, acted\\, directed\\, produced\\, edited and released without anyone saying: hang on\\, this is Star Wars\\, not some random sci-fi teenage battle flick\\, maybe this does not quite meet the standard required by that franchise.\\n\\nI will not rehash all the faults as they have been eloquently set out in the many previous reviews (mess of plot\\, juvenile humour\\, boring characters\\, unnecessary SJW messaging...).  I will however repeat what has also been said many times before: this has killed my enthusiasm for future Star Wars releases and even damaged my nostalgic love for the older ones.  \\n\\nAgain\\, how did people whose only job is to produce movies not see this coming??","true":true}
