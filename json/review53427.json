Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney had a pile of money to operate with when they decided to buy this from Lucas. They could've done anything. Any of the characters from the extended universe mixed with some new ideas would've been more than fine. What did they do? They proceeded to take acid to the original mythology and replaced our long established characters with cheap imitations. The affirmative action Star Wars with none of the soul and all of the loud visual noise that bludgeoned the viewer into submission. What a garbage franchise written and directed by people who just recently discovered what Star Wars is. A total insult to anyone who chucked money at this corporate monolith the past four decades. Disney basically said \\\"Hey\\, thanks for making this a viable brand but guess what? We no longer want you.\\\" \\n\\nThis movie is everything that's wrong with the modern Hollywood film. Written by people who have no grasp on the material. They tear down the work of people who actually had to use their imagination and replace it with stupid shit that no one cares about. The Duchamp version of Star Wars. Stick to the original trilogy. It's quite apparent we're never going to reach the creative peak the old ones hit. The will to make a quality film that isn't full of self-aggrandizing political nonsense is simply not present in the industry. Garbage.","true":true}
