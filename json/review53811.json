Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hammock is brilliant\\, but that's about all I enjoyed from The Last Jedi. Too much has been borrowed from the original films with TLJ being a repeat of Empire and ROTJ. I'd hoped for an all powerful Luke eventual duelreally it's m with Snoke and for prequel level light-sabre sequences.","true":true}
