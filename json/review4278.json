Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst SW movie ever made. Felt more like a parody\\, a la Space Balls\\, without the wit. A movie made by accountants and marketing executives. \\n\\nBoring plot; poor acting; cringe-worthy script. \\n\\nSoulless. This movie broke my childhood over its knee.","true":true}
