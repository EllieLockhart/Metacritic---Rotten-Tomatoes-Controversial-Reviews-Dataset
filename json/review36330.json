Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The moive was darker then the past films but it also had funny moments to balance it out. It had so many pilot twist and turns it kept you guessing what would happen next.  Carrie's performance was wonderful. I'd say it just as good as the originals and I want to see it again.","true":true}
