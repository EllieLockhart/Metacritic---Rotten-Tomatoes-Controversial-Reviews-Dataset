Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a star wars fan from being a child this has crushed me. I feel lost with the future of this franchise and I don't care about any of the characters AT ALL. The comedy didn't work\\, the plot wasnt believable and by the way- if you took out the rose and Finn story it wouldn't make any difference. The whole thing felt like a Disney film\\, NOT A STAR WARS FILM. This is the worst film of the series and I don't think Rian Johnson can save this\\, and he's destroyed the franchise for a lot of people. Being set to do more in the future worries me as there are SO MANY PLOT HOLES. Most of the action sequences were fantastic and I loved the lightsaber battles... When there were some\\, but overall I felt as a star wars fan we were ignored and crushed. This is not how you should feel after a huge blockbuster film!! If you're a casual filmgoer then you'll probably enjoy this\\, if you're a die hard fan like me prepare to be disappointed overall.","true":true}
