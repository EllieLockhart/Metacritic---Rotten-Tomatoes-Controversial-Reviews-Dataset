Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People who hate this movie are people who are against change. This movie took chances and in my opinion it paid off. Just because people\u2019s theories weren\u2019t correct or questions weren\u2019t answered they decide this movie isn\u2019t good. The questions we did get answers to were because they were the ones that mattered and the ones that weren\u2019t answered means they simply aren\u2019t important to the story. This movie is a Star Wars story that takes chances and paid off. Other then one or two scenes and a few misses on trying to hard on comedy a perfect movie.","true":true}
