Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie. Entertaining. I know it's not saying much\\, but as with the previous episode\\, is light years better than any of the prequels. I don't feel it deviates too much from what makes Star Wars great but it is kept from being a great movie by disconnecting too much from The Force Awakens with regards to character development outside of Luke and maybe Rey. Who is Snoke? We lose him before we really discover anything about him except that his Jedi powers are pretty crazy. What about Rey's lineage? It gives us almost nothing (at least not satisfying or credible) after all the mysterious build-up and foreshadowing in Episode 7. Finn's importance seemed to be diminished and we don't really find out anything new about him either. Frankly I wonder if I would have liked it more had I never seen The Force Awakens. There are some epic moments too\\, and unlike some\\, I have no problem with what was done with Luke. We see new depth and complexity to him which includes weakness. It takes nothing away from his greatness\\, and in my opinion adds to it. I will certainly watch it again\\, and suspect I will enjoy it just as much\\, if not more\\, upon rewatching. It certainly could have been better though. ","true":true}
