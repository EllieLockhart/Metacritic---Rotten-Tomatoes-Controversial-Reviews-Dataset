Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been nothing but impressed with the sequels so far and I really enjoyed this movie. While I was surprised by the backlash bandwagon that made the film out to be worse than it was I'm not necessarily convinced these complainers have any grounds to even pretend they are story snobs. I mean this is a saga that once gave us Jar Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker complaining about sand in his crack while using the force to play with fruit. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens\\, Rogue One\\, Last Jedi and Solo have all entertained me in different ways and while they aren't entirely perfect  I have enjoyed every experience in the theater watching them. I have always been a Star Wars fan\\, particularly the original trilogy. My fianc\u00e9 loved this flick\\, as did my mom. My father\\, who lined up to see all three original flicks when they came out said he enjoyed this one the best out of the entire Saga and its spin offs. Go figure. We are all very excited for Episode IX!","true":true}
