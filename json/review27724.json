Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People criticising this film simply because they wanted it to be something else. It is a good film. Great action\\, interesting plot and characters. A great example of what a Star Wars film can be. But the fans are just embarrassing themselves.","true":true}
