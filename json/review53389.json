Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed in how Luke was presented and how some other story elements were handled\\, but I enjoyed it overall\\, and hope to see it again quickly. I'm afraid the fan base ratings backlash will end up doing more harm than good. I am sad that the original trio (Luke\\, Leia and Han) have been killed off and snubbed since Return of the Jedi. the prequels had some good moments and some memorable characters\\, but I'm sadder than ever now that The Originals actors we're not in the following movies. I am glad that Last Jedi gave Carrie Fisher Princess Leia Great Moments in this film\\, the Y will always be sad that Star Wars 9 was supposed to be her movie even more then 8 twas\\, but due to her sudden death that will never come to be.","true":true}
