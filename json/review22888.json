Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looked great\\, but have never been so torn on a movie in my life. There were some beautiful moments visually\\, but then... There was no detail when it came to the nuance and intricacies of the story and lore. Compared to even the prequels the story was trash. The forced humur ruined moments that were meant to be intense or dramatic\\, tone deaf. It felt disrespectful at times. I really liked Rian johnsons's past work and everything he was saying going in. I had a lot of hope. Now\\, It hurts to analyze and think about. I love Star Wars and this movie left me with a void in my heart.","true":true}
