Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"convoluted.  too many jump the shark\/nuke the fridge moments.  the plot was paper thin. Luke's catchphrase is nonsensical.  Kylo's Charlie Rose gaff was completely gratuitous and like most of the twists and turns\\, without any reason than to grab the audiences attention. I didn't love TFA but it was overall much better than this.  It doesn't hold a candle to R1.","true":true}
