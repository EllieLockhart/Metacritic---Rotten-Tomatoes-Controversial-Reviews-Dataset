Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi opts to drop everything Star Wars to \\\"Let the past die.\\\" It is entertaining and visually stunning\\, but fails to connect with the feel of Star Wars.\\nEverything from the slap-happy humor to Luke's treatment felt unnatural. The Last Jedi also toys with new powers and maneuvers in a way that seem great\\, but these ultimately set-up future Star Wars installments for failure. The most important being the Holdo maneuver. This act was visually stunning and left me in awe\\, but it breaks precedent set down before.\\nRey and Kylo's connection is ultimately my favorite part of The Last Jedi. The two are like the opposite sides of a coin. Different in many ways\\, but still one\\, still connected.\\nThe Last Jedi is fun\\, but I left feeling unfulfilled and questioning many of the \\\"goofy\\\" moments. Maybe this is due to my lacking of that blue milk Luke enjoy's so much.","true":true}
