Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed:\\n\\n- What was the point of those cute things that looked like puffins?\\n\\n- Poor sub casting.\\n\\n- Not a lot happened.\\n\\n- Weak story\\, which was lazy and convenient e.g just happen to drift past an old rebel base and find another code breaker bloke in the same cell that you're locked up in WTF!\\n\\n- The whole casino thing didn't work for me and was daft.\\n\\n- Key scenes were copied from Retun of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nShame really as the last film promised so much in where this story could go ??","true":true}
