Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is overall just a mess. It clearly is trying to emulate the nostalgia of empire strikes back but fails. Jokes are out of place\\, parts of the story are  mess and it struggles to keep consistent tones across scenes. They ruined previous plot lines and all suspense that was set up from ep7. The film tries so hard to be different and unexpected that it falls flat on its head and betrays who some previously established characters even are. However\\, if you can look the awful writing and simply just want to see a star wars film go for it. However\\, if things such as 30 minute segments of the film that add little to nothing to the plot and are overall just pointless\\, save your time and money.","true":true}
