Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is what happens when you allow a monstrous corporation like Disney to take the reigns on a franchise like Star Wars. The atmosphere\\, tone\\, dialogue and even the \\\"star wars physics\\\" were completely out of place. I will never pay to see another Star Wars movie after this rubbish.","true":true}
