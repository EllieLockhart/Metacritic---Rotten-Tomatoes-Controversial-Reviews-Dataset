Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total Disney garbage. Doesn't add anything to the star wars lore. No interesting character twists. Po and Finn stories are dull and pointless. All the fan theories about Rey and Kylo are far more interesting than what actually happened. This is the marvel-ification of film. Crappy story. Awful villains. No depth whatsoever. Just crappy chase scenes and explosions. ","true":true}
