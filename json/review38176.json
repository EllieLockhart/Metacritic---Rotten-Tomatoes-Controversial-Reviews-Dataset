Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The trailer did warn us that this want going to go how we thought it would. To all those who think it should be Sith vs Jedi\\, why?  Because that is what was in the original? Wait didn't everyone complain about the fact the other one was TOO MUCH LIKE EP 3 TO 6?! And now you're all mad it's different. Make your minds! \\n\\nIf you want to see me different star wears go see this film. \\n\\nIf you want to whine about somethibg","true":true}
