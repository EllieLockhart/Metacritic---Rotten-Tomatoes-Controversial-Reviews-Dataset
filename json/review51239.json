Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely my least favourite star wars movie and one of the most disgusting writing ever...With the tension and hype that the Force Awakens brought for example Snoke\\, Rey's parents and Luke's reaction at the end of the movie with his light saber. Throwing all of it out of the window it was brought with pointless and meaningless scenes and characters\\, a lacking plot wich felt empty and pointless. This star wars felt like a true Disney movie and not in a good way.","true":true}
