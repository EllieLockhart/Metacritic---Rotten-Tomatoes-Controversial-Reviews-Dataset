Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't see how the critics loved this so much. It had entire sub plots that were irrelevant\\, a moment with Leia that didn't make ANY sense and totally took me out of the movie\\, and I'm not really liking who the main villain will be moving forward. I don't mind the Luke story line as much as other and I liked the development of Poe\\, but I just don't think it's a good movie.","true":true}
