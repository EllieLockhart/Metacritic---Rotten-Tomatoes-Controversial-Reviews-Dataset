Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was badly written and is just a big piece of crap. Kathleen Kennedy should be removed as creative director\\, JJ Abrams needs to be replaced for episode IX. Rian Johnson can't write a Star Wars film for shit. There have been many good story lines in the new cannon material\\, but you can not screw up the main saga the way they have. I have seen all of the film's\\, watched all of the TV shows\\, and read all of the new cannon books. Disney should just through this piece off shit out like they did with all the \\\" Legends \\\" material and call it non cannon. At least Star Wars \\\" Legends \\\" had a better story line for after the Return Of The Jedi.","true":true}
