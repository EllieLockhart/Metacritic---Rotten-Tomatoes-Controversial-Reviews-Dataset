Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say\\, I\u2019m sick of all the hate towards this movie\\, first everyone complains about awakens being too predictable and now everyone\u2019s pissed off that they didn\u2019t guess the whole plot on their YouTube channel. When I first watched the Last Jedi there was a moment when I had no idea what was going to happen\\, I was at the edge of my seat the entire time waiting to see what was coming next. Sure it wasn\u2019t perfect\\, there were characters and scenes that didn\u2019t really need to be there but that has happened in every episode\\, Jj binks\\, I don\u2019t like sand\\, Ewoks\\, you name it. The amount of hate towards this movie in particular is undeserved and to be honest\\, embarrassing. If you hate corporate agendas then direct your hatred towards the corporation and not the people they hired. The more support shown to the Star Wars films and projects\\, the more inclined Disney would be to respond to our requests.","true":true}
