{"101487":139676,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie weeks ago and I finally decided to write a review hoping it would make me feel better about the whole thing. I didn't like the movie\\, and to be clear I am not a bot\\, nor am I a white male whining about gender roles in the film. \\n\\nAt first I thought I was upset because I am a long-time fan of Star Wars\\, and the movie just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. It felt like whoever wrote this movie actually hates Star Wars. I think some originality was called for after 8 Star Wars movies\\, but this film felt like some sort of personal vendetta where the creators went out of their way to ridicule the original movies at every opportunity. I mean to have Luke Skywalker himself mock the idea of a guy with a \\\"laser sword\\\" taking on the First Order himself is clearly a shot at the original trilogy. After all\\, that was basically the premise of those movies. I could write that off as simply poking fun at the movie's heritage\\, but stuff like that goes on all movie. The theme of a few pilots going up against impossible odds to inexplicably save the day is also serially belittled\\, despite that again being a recurring Star Wars motif. But ok fine\\, maybe it was a great movie and I'm just an overly sensitive SW fanboy that's just whining\\, as SW fanboys tend to do.\\n\\nThen I thought about it some more. My wife is not a SW fan\\, she's seen all the movies exactly once\\, and only to humour me. She didn't mind them. She liked Rogue One. She thought this movie was awful. She has no investment whatsoever in the SW lore and history\\, but told me (before I told her my opinion) that the story was way too slow and didn't make any sense. I think this is true. If you engage your critical thinking skills to any degree\\, it's hard to argue that the writing of this film is anything but super lazy. I'm actually ok with the plot twists from a distance (spoilers ahead). Luke Skywalker as a broken\\, disillusioned man? Interesting\\, tell me more. That certainly is unexpected. But the way they executed it was awful. Why would Luke\\, who successfully turned the mass murderer Darth Vader to the light and overthrew the evil Empire decided to murder his own nephew in his sleep? For this to be convincing you need to have a compelling reason. But the best they could come up with was some sketchy vibes from Kylo??? Dude hadn't even done anything wrong yet. \\n\\nTake Poe\\, the loose cannon. I didn't really get that impression from him in the Force Awakens\\, but ok interesting tell me more. But the whole mutiny being prefaced on the fact that Holdo didn't tell him the plan just seems sloppy. Poe had enough support among the crew to stage a mutiny\\, but somehow didn't get wind of a plan to evacuate the entire ship? I feel like a few people would've had to know about that ahead of time\\, particularly pilots. I'm sure 5 minutes of thought could've come up with a plausible and thought-provoking moral dilemma that could've explained a divide between Poe and Holdo\\, and divided audiences as to what the right course of action is.\\n\\nI'm actually fine with Rey's parents being nobodies\\, and Snoke being killed off. It certainly was shocking. But how Snoke doesn't notice a lightsaber right next to him spinning around is beyond me. All it would've taken is a foreshadowing line from Kylo commenting on how Snoke's faculties are failing to make it more believable. Or have Snoke stabbed in the back by one of his red guards while he's distracted by Kylo\\, and have it revealed Kylo has been plotting Snoke's downfall for some time. Seriously\\, 5 minutes of thought by an actual writer could've made things so much better. \\n\\nThe whole movie seemed skin deep\\, beautiful visuals\\, unexpected twists\\, dilemmas that all don't actually stand up to any sort of critical thought process. Everything seemed done to be flashy without any respect for continuity\\, logic\\, or interesting character development\\, which for me requires the character's growth to make some semblance of sense. Flipping characters' personalities and actions around randomly for shock value is not \\\"character development\\\" - it's lazy and insulting writing.\\n\\nSolo will be the first Star Wars movie that has come out in my lifetime that I will not be seeing in theatres. And Episode IX? I have no interest in seeing it at all.","true":true}
