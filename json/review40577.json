Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. Important details go unexplained\\, there are plot lines that are pointless that does not move the story forward\\, the main villain is weak both in the force and in character\\, there's a whole lot of goofiness that shouldn't be there (and people said jar jar binks was bad) and certain individuals become strong in the force with zero explanation as to how they got there with no training. I didn't like Episode 2 & 3 but this one was worse than those 2.","true":true}
