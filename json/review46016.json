Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually spectacular like TFA\\, but beset by the same poorly conceived plot and weak characterization.  I did not enjoy TFA.  I particularly found Rey to be a flat character\\, as if Disney wasn't willing to take any risks with the female lead\\, by giving her the flaws that come with a real personality.  This movie did nothing to change that assessment and merely cemented her as  super-great-at-everything for no internally consistent reason.\\n\\nSnoke's fate was a huge wasted Sith-Jedi mythos potential\\, which was frankly insulting to the audience.  Finn's story was weak\\, Poe's was farcical\\, and Phasma was squandered.\\n\\nThe space battles were pretty amazing though\\, with some 'wow!' scenes\\, but that's only enough for about one star.  The production design was pretty great too.  Carrie Fischer was a joy to watch\\, but the space scene was a bit much.","true":true}
