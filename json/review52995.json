Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan im highly disappointed. Its the most beautiful looking bundle of bad ideas in a movie ever. Even outside of the star wars universe this story just doesnt hold up. And without the specticle of the amazing soecial effects this movie gives us one dumb thing after another. The choppy speed pacing in the beginning and the dragging in the middle with an anticlimactic end. The treatment of the characters is poor at best. They want us to love and sinvest in these new characters that are being passed the proverbial star wars legacy torch but johnson gives u no reason to fall for them. Poe goes from being a highly trained and trusted member of the \\\"resistance\\\" in ep7 to a hotheaded idiot in ep8. Finn is wasted again on a meaningless task with weak characters. Rey gets nothing for training and is even more badass. Not to mention that the overall timeline from ep7 to ep8 is a couple days tops and as she goes to full blown force using badass over bight so does the first order which was a fringe element in ep7 the day before and now is the ultimate power. The treatment of the Skywalkers was a tragedy and watching this movie will effect how you watch the original trilogy because you wont be able to see them again knowing how sad and lame it ends for the characters we love so much. The first star wars movie i only needed to see once.","true":true}
