Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Wow\\, where to start. I was anticipating this game for a very long time after the playing the first. Gutted.The gameplay is painfully dull and more often than not pointless as everything interesting happens in very long cutscenes. It's not even worth talking about.The 'moral' of the story is absolutely weak. Revenge isnt the right way? After being forced to kill every member of Abbys team\\, you leave her alive? The woman who murdered Joel? The reason for the entire story? There is no reason to make her seem 'good'\\, she killed Joel in revenge and then acts like Ellie is stupid for trying to take revenge on her? The most interesting characters are killed off unceremoniously (Jessie\\, Joel\\, Mel\\, Owen) and for what? Nothing gets resolved? You might as well have made a film instead of a game\\, but then you couldn't charge \u00a360 for it hey?I dont mind Joel dying\\, although he deserved something less mundane. Some story elements were really well done\\, but sadly they were few and far between. There is 0 enjoyment in this game. Watch someone play it if you want to see the story\\, but god you aren't missing a thing by not spending a ridiculous amount of money on it.If you liked TLOU\\, you wont like this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
