Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie in the Disney era so far. From a technical level\\, it is the best Star Wars movie so far\\, it's cinematography is rivaled only by Rogue One. It is well acted\\, well directed & well edited. Kylo Ren\\, Luke Skywalker & Rey are the best parts of the movie. The movie tries to juggle too many ideas & themes\\, and can often be self-indulgent in auteur theory at the expense of being accessible to as many Star Wars audience members as possible. But then again\\, i'm just a pretentious Star Wars fan who loves themes\\, themes\\, themes & has always advocated for the writer-director approach to film making\\, so it is exactly my type of film. I rank it as my 3rd or 4th favourite Star Wars film.","true":true}
