Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't see how they recover from this. This movie threw away every plot point set up by TFA. Truly disappointing. This movie made be feel disenchanted and incredibly discouraged for the future of SW. I have no interest in the movies going forward. I will stick to the first three and try to forget the rest. Rogue One was wonderful. TFA was not all bad and I atleast felt JJ cared and created some interesting plot points...Rian Johnson seemed almost spiteful in his total disregard for the movies before TLJ and spit in the face of JJ Abram's direction. What a gigantic middle finger to some of the best most die hard fans and to an incredible franchise. He will only be remembered for this and he seems to enjoy it. Pathetic. I AM NOT A BOT....","true":true}
