Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry - on second viewing my like this more - but really slight story - too many plot contrivances. Adam Driver saves it. There were a couple of amazing shots\\, couple of funny points. A lot to wrap up in the next instalment. Maybe the template is just too predictable now - but then without that you lose Star Wars. Maybe I would have enjoyed and connected with it more if I wasn't in physical pain having sat through The Force Awakens as part of a double bill\\,","true":true}
