Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now before someone comes at me about being a Star Wars  hating  fan that is just complete and utter nonsense. I love Star Wars so much that I feel it is my obligation as a Star War fan to show Disney how I feel about the new installation in the Star Wars the last Jedi.  When it comes to Star Wars the best part of it for me is the lore and all the storytelling that makes Star Wars stand out from the rest. In the last Jedi the lore and the storytelling is all jumbled up and hard to decipher (without going into spoilers). Any plot point that was set up in the previous installation Star Wars the force awakens has been completely and utterly thrown out the window and replaced by a new shell of a Star Wars story.  Even Mark Hamill himself said that he did not agree with the way the story was being read.","true":true}
