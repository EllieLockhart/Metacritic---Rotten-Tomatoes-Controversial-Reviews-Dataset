Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a quote I found from a commenter on YouTube that sums it up pretty nicely: \\\"Ever seen a relay race where a runner receives the baton from a teammate\\, then turns around and shoots that teammate? No? Well the last Jedi did just that.\\\"","true":true}
