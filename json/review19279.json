Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not my favorite Star Wars movie. The story was not that great. But I still enjoyed it. To me Rian Johnson just completly did things the way he wanted to with this movie and did not care or even respected the fans of Star Wars. And I truly hope he stays away from the Star Wars franchise. ","true":true}
