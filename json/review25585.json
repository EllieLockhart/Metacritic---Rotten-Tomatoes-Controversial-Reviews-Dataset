Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOT a fanboy here. Simply put\\, the whole story is rushed\\, badly edited\\, and the general evolution of the characters is really approximate\\, generic\\, (again) rushed\\, shallow. It feels like huge things are coming\\, and then nothing really happens. Some really stupid things here there (flying characters and sudden deaths)\\, some explanations that will never given (read: what do we do with this character? Mmm don't know\\, let's kill him so it's done) Simply unconvincing. A huge\\, huge letdown.","true":true}
