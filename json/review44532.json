Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To sum things up this movie looks like squeezing a toothpaste tube that has been empty for days. It is full of cliches\\, bad jokes\\, redundant characters\\, illogicality and it's impossible to shake off the feeling of general lack of true inspiration behind it's creation. \\n\\nIt starts with a stupid space battle\\, followed by senseless space chase forced beyond any logic just so that the movie would have a story to go with. Than we are treated to an hour or so of Luke Skywalker acting like a 6 year old child while in a sub-story that will lead to nothing\\, excess characters will go to\\, no less than a casino! A casino in Star Wars!! Come on!!\\n\\nTo vindicate things a bit\\, there are two characters in the movie that actually make an effort and these are off course Ray and Kylo. But to see their story you have to watch through all the other stuff going on that is on the intellectual level of Independence Day.\\n\\nFortunately\\, to save the character that was loved for 40 years Luke will in the end get a grip for about 5 minutes\\, and appear as a wise Jedi he should be. This makes for an original confrontation scene with Kylo. But all of that is happening amidst such nonsense and a story that is so boring I've felt like shuffling through google a bit while still in the theater.\\n\\nWhat the hell did critics like about this movie? Does anyone fell like re-watching this movie for pleasure? My guess is no.","true":true}
