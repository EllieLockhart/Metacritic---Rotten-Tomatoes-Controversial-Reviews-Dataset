Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A phenomenally innovative and extremely ballsy entry to the series. The fact that many fans aren't appreciating it\\, is how you know it was a different\\, unexpected and high risk-taking film. Smarter\\, less \\\"black and white\\\" and more complex than any Star Wars film before it. Gives each and every character (new and old) a ton of dimension\\, deep motives and a reason to empathize with\\, even the wildlife and droids. Characters that were lame in The Force Awakens now have plenty of reason for us to care for them\\, and have worthy subplots that will be stuck in your mind long after viewing. Everyone is greatly tested. The film takes the series to new places\\, cracks open the flaws of Star Wars lore and questions them\\, further strengthening the story of the saga as a whole. The film has huge personality\\, not afraid to make fun of itself and to cast aside dopey fan theories in a way that feels almost meta. If you are a huge Wars fan but also desire something new from the series\\, this is your film. Long Live Supreme Leader Rian.","true":true}
