Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bots and naysayer's be d***Ed!  This was a great Star Wars movie with lots of action and intrigue!  The characters were well fleshed out and fun.  The story had lots of unexpected twists which was a great contrast from Force Awakens.  Everyone who complained the Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope are probably the same people who are complaining now that this was too different.  Some people will just never be satisfied and the rest seem to be bots bringing the score down!  See it yourself and ignore the noise!","true":true}
