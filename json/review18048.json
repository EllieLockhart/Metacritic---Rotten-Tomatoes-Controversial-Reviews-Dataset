Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this movie has huge plot holes\\, doesn't uncover any of the great secrets from episode VII (or at least not to any satisfying point) and comes up with big inconsistencies like Luke behaving completely abnormal. Then there's a lot of blunt humor which seems totally misplaced and a completely unnecessary part of the movie (the casino planet stuff). Benicio Del Toro is wasted for a senseless character. The Rose character also makes no sense and adds nothing important to the movie or the story. Yes\\, it looks good\\, but here's the sad truth: CGI can't rescue a movie (but is capable of destroying one...). I'v seen all star wars movies a lot of times\\, even the prequels. I don't feel that I want to watch this one again.","true":true}
