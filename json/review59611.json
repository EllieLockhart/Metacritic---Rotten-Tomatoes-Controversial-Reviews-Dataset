The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First lets address some of the stupid criticisms:This game is not some LGBTQ+ propaganda. Yes Ellie is gay\\, and her love interest is a significant character\\, but her being gay has no importance to the story. The game would not be any different if she was straight and Dina was a guy. Ellie is the main character on an incredible adventure\\, that just happens to be gay. There's not a leftist agenda being pushed on Ellie's sexuality\\, just a character trait. Second\\, Abby's arms are huge. If you had lost your dad and spent the next four years tracking his murder down to seek revenge\\, my guess is you'd be hitting the gym hard. Abby is a brute character and provides a very fun gameplay difference from what we're used to.This game is DARK\\, and does not have a happy ending. I was very mad at Joel's death\\, but I knew it had to happen. The point of this game was to show that all actions have consequences\\, and there are two sides to every story. It's easy for us to think that Joel made the right choice in part 1 saving Ellie\\, because we played the whole game as Joel. But he killed a lot of people\\, including Abby's father. It's great that we're mad at Abby in the beginning\\, because we buy into Ellie's revenge story. We cheer her on at every step and don't care about the lives she takes because to us\\, they're the bad guys that killed joel.Then the tables turn\\, we play as the murder. It's weird\\, I didn't like it. I found as many ways as possible to kill abby just hoping I could change joel's faith. Then we learn about her father\\, and start playing as her perspective. You start to care about her and her friends and want to explain it all to Ellie. All the sudden we feel bad about Owen and Mel\\, we want to do it all differently. This game makes you feel all sorts of crazy emotions. We hate Abby for killing joel\\, hate it. But understand the reason\\, because we played the same with Ellie. Both sides are avenging a father figure\\, and both sides are blinded by this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
