Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a piece of trash I can't even put into words what a disappointment this movie was\\, after the incredible Force Awakens I really had my hopes up but they were crushed within the first 10 minutes.\\n\\nWaste of film.","true":true}
