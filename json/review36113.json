Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a huge disappointment. The attempt at humor was just too much too often. And the villains are weak and there moments short lived. Kylo Ren continues to be a little B although he had some good moments. I just want to take a moment of silence for the 2 million plus stormtroopers that died toward the resistances about 350.?","true":true}
