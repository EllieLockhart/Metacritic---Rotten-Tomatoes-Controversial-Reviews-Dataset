Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually some of the coolest stuff we've seen done with Star Wars.  Storywise\\, what the hell was this?  As others have said\\, it completely throws away all the questions that were introduced in The Force Awakens and which you assumed would set up the sequel.  (And yes I know the The Force Awakens was basically a remake of A New Hope.  I'm 47 and saw A New Hope opening weekend as a kid and have been all things Star Wars my entire life).   I can see why Disney would have been inclined to give Rian Johnson his own new trilogy to develop but he should not have been given Episode 8 because he obviously had no intention to develop the story that JJ Abrams introduced.  And again as an old school SW fan\\, what he did with Luke Skywalker is completely insulting to the franchise.  I might see it once more but I will not be seeing this one the 4 or 5 times in the theater that I have with every other SW release.","true":true}
