Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finaly a fresh take on the tired Star Wars formula. Not everything works and the three main characters could have been utilized a little bit better here and there\\, but overall they all get three very strong arcs. Probably the first Star Wars Movie since the very first one\\, that's actually true to what it preaches.\\n\\nThis would have been a great jumping off point for the Finale of the new trilogy or even a new one. Sadly\\, that didn't happen.","true":true}
