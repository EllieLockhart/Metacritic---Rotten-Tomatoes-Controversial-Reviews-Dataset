Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So watched the last jedi.... Hmmmm my thoughts are I liked it but it had some flaws some major and some minor...\\n\\nCan't really do a lot hole write up with this cause it's to spoiler heavily.. But I will say there is some stuff that was built up in episode VII the force awakens that was just sort off just ignored and kinda like meh.. It was a journey with no pay off. Some other stuff in the story that really really didn't need to be there.... And something that happens that was both sad and joyful...\\nEnough with the flaws I had \\nFor the most part I really did like the last jedi.. I had tears in some scenes it was emotional and great... but at the end of the day the bad out way the good unfortunately","true":true}
