Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is complete garbage. So many stupid eronious plots. As a Star Wars fan I'm so disappointed. First off you don't need 30 comic reliefs. The opening scene with the general and a fighter pilot doing a prank call starts the movie off horribly. Princess flying through space like Superman is unreal stupid. The cheesy sayings\\, the lack of any semblance of a story. Everyone that had a hand in this monstrosity needs to be fired. After the first one I was so excited only to see a movie where Luke and snoke were thrown away like garbage. Awful awful awful. Also I don't care about animal cruelty the industrial military's complex or any other stupid themes during a Star Wars film. And Rose was the worst character since Jar Jar or maybe ever. Just redo this film and pretend it never happens Disney. Say you are sorry and give yourselves a mulligan.","true":true}
