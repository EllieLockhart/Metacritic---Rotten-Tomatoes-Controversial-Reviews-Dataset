Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You thought the prequels were bad right?  Wait til you get a load of this movie!  Bad acting\\, bad pacing\\, no direction and a character who is even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks AKA Rose!","true":true}
