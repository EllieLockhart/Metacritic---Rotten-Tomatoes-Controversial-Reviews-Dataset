Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The three rebels we met in A Force Awakens\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rey\\, each serve the light and split up to complete a mission that will help to defeat the First Order. Rey goes to find Luke Skywalker who everyone hopes will return and bring order back to the Universe. Luke trains Rey in ways unimaginable to learn Jedi techniques. Poe defies every superior to advance his gung-ho agenda. Soon he learns that maybe the Admirals and Generals know much more about military strategy even if it means losing a few battles to win the ultimate war. Finn and an engineer named Rose fly off to find a safecracker in order to disable the tracking device that is inhibiting the Rebel ships' escape. They end up on the Imperial Destroyer where they are captured and almost executed. After all that\\, the Rebel put up a final stand on a salt planet that was once a Rebel hideout. While it looks bleak for them at the end of film\\, they uncover Kylo Ren's big weakness which could lead to the unraveling of the First Order in the Star Wars Universe and may bring balance back to the Force.","true":true}
