Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand some of the hate about this film\\, some passages were not needed and could have easily found themselves on the cutting room floor. Other thing happen and you turn to your Significant Other with a face of shock and humour waiting for it to be over so you can go back to enjoying the movie. However despite this\\, I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Jedi for its rollercoaster ride of change and pushing the story forward. We now know that the force has truly awakened and is far stronger than we could have possibly imagined. I for one am looking forward to the 'Rian' inspired trilogy and Episode 9.","true":true}
