Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a very good movie.  Large plot holes and incompatible time sequences.  One set of events appear to take days while another set is supposed to be occurring in a set time period.  A good editor could have reduced this entire movie to about 30 minutes and the pieces of a decent movie.   Synopsis: An extended episode of Battle Star Galactica - the original TV version.","true":true}
