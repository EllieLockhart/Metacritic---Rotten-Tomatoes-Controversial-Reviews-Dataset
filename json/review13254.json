{"101487":131276,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why Disney even bothered to buy the franchise. After the prequels it would have been so simple to satisfy the fans\\, you could tell that with The Force Awakens. It was a rehash of A New Hope but people were just happy to see new Star Wars movies being made. After The Last Jedi im left wondering: why even bother? They somewhat tried to rehash The Empire Strikes Back but the story is such a disjointed mess and the characters actions are very questionable. Plus the countless stuff that makes no sense like Leia hovering through space like wtf","true":true}
