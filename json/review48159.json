Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this movie had several key elements that elevated it to the minimum quality expected from a Star Wars movie\\, it was hamstrung by irrelevant and bloated plot lines and an utter lack of character development. Is this supposed to be Guardians of the Galaxy? Because it looks like the director just saw that movie and decided 'hey\\, easy cash grab.' The logical inconsistencies and lack of exposition compound on each other to make an utterly incomprehensible plot that was half fan service and half Disney attempting to milk the franchise for cheap laughs and toy sales. Everything that The Force Awakens did right\\, this movie did wrong. And while it attempted to expand the new story line past the fan service of episode 7\\, the only notable expansions were gimicky and led to unresolved plot lines. What has this series become? F*$k you Rian Johnson.","true":true}
