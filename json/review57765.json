Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very sad to see the decline of the Star Wars Saga. Disney has really screwed the pooch. This movie won't be a let down for the masses and is still worth watching\\, however\\, for a fan from the beginning you will be sadly disappointed with the route Disney choose to take. \\n\\nHopefully\\, Disney can find a way to salvage the series and turn it around in the next one....maybe. No lightsaber battle with Kylo and Luke? Seriously...","true":true}
