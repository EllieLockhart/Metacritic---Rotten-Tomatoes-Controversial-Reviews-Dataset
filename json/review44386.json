Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"too many slapstick moments that took away the weight of the film\\, Rose got more backstory than every other character and also SHE'S THE WORST\\, the acting is really off on many scenes\\, Luke did not just disappoint\\, he smeared his legacy with the stinkiest of shits (also let's not kid ourselves and say they Leia has been trained) \\, General Hux is unfortunately a child wearing a grown man's mask\\, convoluted subplot with Finn and Rose was egregious","true":true}
