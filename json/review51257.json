Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely ruined my childhood hero. Turned him into a sad old man with Low-T. I liked TFA but honestly don't care about 9 now.
