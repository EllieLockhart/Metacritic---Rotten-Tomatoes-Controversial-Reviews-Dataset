Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it last night\\, thought it was the best of all the Star Wars movies since the first three. \\n\\nI liked it.\\n\\nA Lot of action\\, some humor\\, strong references to the first three\\, a bit long though.","true":true}
