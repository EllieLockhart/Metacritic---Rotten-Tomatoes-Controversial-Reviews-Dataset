Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On first viewing I was appalled in places\\, surprised at the audacity of over the top powers\\, reveals and literally laughed in places I don't think were intended to be funny. Viewing it again\\, and again\\, brought a deeper understanding of the plight of Luke Skywalker & the new rebellion (the Resistance) and saw the vision Johnson had in creating this next installment of the SW franchise. \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\" as Luke puts it\\, and there are certainly parts of the whole that you won't like on 1st viewing. Watch it all\\, watch it again and make your judgement after letting it sink in. It's definitely worth it.","true":true}
