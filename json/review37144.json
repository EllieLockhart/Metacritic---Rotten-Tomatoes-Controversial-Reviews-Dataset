Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason for the pure hatred of this movie is it challenges what purists think Star Wars is and people are upset that their fan theories weren't correct. People were upset that Force Awakens was a rehash of A New Hope. Now people are upset that The Last Jedi takes Star Wars in a new direction. \\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Is it perfect? No. There are some scenes that make you go \\\"That's pretty weird.\\\" And I don't feel the characters were developed as well as they could have been. But the movie was a boat load of fun and that's all I ask out of Star Wars movies.\\n\\nIf you honestly think this is worse than the prequels then I don't know what to tell you.","true":true}
