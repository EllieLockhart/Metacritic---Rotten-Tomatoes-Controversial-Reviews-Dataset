Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just sad to see so much of what I grew up loving about this world thrown away in one film. I\u2019m all for pushing boundaries and telling new stories but I don\u2019t think you have to crap on the ones you\u2019ve already told. I have no clue how they can still say they intend for this to be a cohesive trilogy. Everything that was setup in VII was passed over or torn down in this. The only reason I even rate it this highly is because the visuals were great and there were some really fun moments but overall I left feeling disappointed.","true":true}
