Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Doesn't deserve all the hate from \\\"fanboys\\\" who feel it doesn't fit their idea of Star Wars. This film fits right in with all the others. Is it Empire? No\\, but then nothing is. The casual Star Wars viewer will probably find nothing wrong with it... The basement dwelling 40 year old virgin in the Boba Fett costume probably hates it.","true":true}
