Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the huge flow of positive reviews\\, I was like \\\"this is going to be the greatest movie of 2017\\\". After 2 hours and whatever minutes\\, I was actually cursing outside the theatre. So if I had to describe it\\, the movie was DISAPPOINTING. Seeing it Thursday night\\, I was completely bummed out at school the next day. Anyway\\, about the movie. It wasn't bad...but man was it not good. The thing that got me was that the first hour or so was boring. I was wanting to ask the person next to me if he was bored too. Next\\, the characters were actually pathetic: Luke was a wuss\\, Rey was just in the way of Luke\\, Poe (sadly) was annoying\\, Finn was just there\\, Kylo still reminded me of an edgy goth teenager\\, Snoke just straight up dies so no answers from that\\, and then there is Rose. Oh God\\, why was rose in the movie\\, she was just an annoying loser who would've probably been better if she wasn't played by a mediocre actress. I had NO care for any of the characters throughout this movie. Lastly\\, the Action was nowhere near good as TFA. sure the Rey and Kylo tag team was pretty cool but that's it. The \\\"Hoth\\\" reenactment was stupid\\, it introduced new weapons and machines that you only saw for about 10 minutes and the whole scene lasted for about 15. The ending just pissed me off because nothing happened. The scene that was supposed to be a \\\"shocker\\\" I called it like the first 40 minutes of the film. Anyway\\, in my opinion\\, TFA was soo much better than this subplot mess. I'm going to see it again with friends am I am contemplating if I should call in sick. Sorry Rian\\, you swung the bat and TOTALLY missed your ball\\, hope the coach kicks you off.","true":true}
