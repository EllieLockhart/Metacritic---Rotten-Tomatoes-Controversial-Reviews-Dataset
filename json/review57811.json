Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"### Warning\\, this review may contain SPOILERS ###\\nAlthough a different type of movie\\, this brings back the feeling of watching Empire and Jedi for the first time. Quite a few plot points are tied and the same goes for characters. It's emotional and strong\\, it's fast paced without rushing the story. Luke in action is what we wanted to see\\, although we could do with more of it. Leia is brilliant without taking the spotlight away from the new gang. I've only seen it twice\\, and will definitely do it a few more times. Worth it\\, although bitter sweet.","true":true}
