Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a disappointment. With lousy writing and a lousy story it definitely shows that it is a disappointment. Not even a great performance by Mark Hamil himself can save it. This movie crashed the sequel trilogy and is now in a gigantic hole that it's gonna have to take a miracle to get out of. The Last Jedi falls short of my expectations and is an embarrass to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
