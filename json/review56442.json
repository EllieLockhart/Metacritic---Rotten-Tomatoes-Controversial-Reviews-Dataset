Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The contrivances that they had to put in place to move the poorly paced story along\\, along with the inexplicable decisions made by many characters at critical times\\, ruined the movie for me. I just can\u2019t stand it when people act stupid in key moments - and this movie has a lot of that. The characters were not handled with respect either. You could tell Johnson wanted to come in and wipe away anything that he did not like about where the story was - and he made it clear which parts he didn\u2019t care about with his offhand treatment of major characters. Also\\, it may seem like a minor thing\\, but his infusion of modern slang and speech patterns was a real disruption from the general pattern of Star Wars movies were things always felt a little more regal and formal. It didn\u2019t even feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie most of the time. Overall\\, the weakest Star Wars films since Phantom Menace.","true":true}
