Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Como eu esperava\\, n\u00e3o foi igual ao 5 e tornou-se um filme muito bom\\, apesar da primeira parte ser um pouco longa em excesso\\, poderia ter uma meia hora a menos. Tive a impress\u00e3o de que focou um pouco mais nos personagens n\u00e3o-jedis\\, como no excelente rogue one.","true":false}
