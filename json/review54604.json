Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so disappointed in this movie. After 2 years of anticipation and speculation...this pile of garbage is what we get?? This movie single handedly ruined star wars. I have so many problems with this movie that can't be fixed in the next episode\\, because then what was the whole point of this trilogy if we have to keep back pedaling? The characters were written poorly with no thought of their previous development\\, so many plot holes\\, half of the movie was pointless with no consequences\\, the story was ridiculous\\, I hate the reylo relationship\\, and I'm extremely upset and angry the Skywalker family ended like this.\\nWhy was there so much mystery and hype over Anakin's lightsaber if it was going to be literally thrown away by Luke (which was ridiculous) and broken by reylo?? How did Maz obtain it? Why was it Rey drawn to it? Guess we'll never know. \\nUltimately\\, I'll be happy if I never have to see this again. It's devastating how the entire mythology and lore of Star Wars was ruined by this shit movie. I'm not excited for episode 9 at all. What a shame.","true":true}
