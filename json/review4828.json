Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete waste of time; sorely disappointed. It seemed as if The Force Awakens never happened. There were a couple of cool action scenes which warrants 1 star but nothing else. At a couple points I was incredibly bored and wanted to walk out - and it crossed my mind that I would rather watch a prequel film than this huge pile of human excrement.\\nLUKE was a coward and should've been given a heroic last stand dodging laser fire with his saber and picking up the four walkers and smashing them down.\\nLEIA had no commanding presence in the film. Marvel hero Leia flying through space was just stupid and meant to be heroic and awe inspiring. The audience laughed when it happened in my theater \\nREY is a Mary Sue and needs no training at all to be the best. I guess the 3 lessons Luke taught here about breathing and lifting rocks was enough training. Oh wait\\, there were only 2 lessons!\\nCAPTAIN PHASMA... seriously guys? Wasted character - good job. Johnson.\\nKYLO REN still doesn't seem to know what his path is. He is a master of hesitation and complaining which only makes him a weenie and that much weaker as a character. Menacing? I think not.\\nSNOKE was just wasted potential\\n\\nOverall opinion:\\nThe slow chase which was like having the enemy take a mud covered trail instead of the paved road\\, Snoke's Death\\, Luke's death\\, Phasma's death\\, Rey's parentage fail\\, Luke milking a sea cow and drinking it\\, the pointless casino world that taught us all animal cruelty is wrong which  makes the trip there purposeful? Finn and Rose serve no purpose\\, Po Dameron acted like a complete douchebag\\, Leia \\\"Superman\\\" Organa\\, BB8 the Swiss Army Knife of the Galaxy\\, Luke's cowardice\\, Kylo the whiny millenial\\, and Snoke being mysterious in TFA to becoming  a cocky a-hole who CANNOT SENSE LET ALONE HEAR A LIGHTSABER MOVING NEXT TO HIM??!!! Oh yeah\\, the Knights of Ren were cool... wait\\, where did they go? \\n\\nWith everything that happened\\, it seemed as if the director was creating a story that he hoped to continue in Episode 9; and I do not believe he was a fan of TFA\\, just throwing that out there. Good luck with your new series... actually no\\, I hope it fails.\\n\\nSo will J.J. Abrams make the final film acceptable? Who knows.","true":true}
