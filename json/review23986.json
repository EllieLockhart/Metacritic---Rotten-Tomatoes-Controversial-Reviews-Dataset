Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many people do not like this movie. I remembered walking out of the theather with a biterrsweet taste after watching it. But not because the movie was bad\\, but because what took place on the story. Yes\\, it has plotholes. And maybe some wrong decisions. But I think the main problem is that people wanted to see something different on the screen. Things that did not happen. But that does not mean the movie is bad!","true":true}
