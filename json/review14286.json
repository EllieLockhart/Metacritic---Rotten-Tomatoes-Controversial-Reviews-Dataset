Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignoring the fancy special effects\\, the story line of the follow up to the highly anticipated next chapter in the Skywalker saga is lacking and is a disappointing entry into a marvelous tale.","true":true}
