Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelievably underwhelming. This did not feel like a \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie. The lack of Lightsaber fights\\, the weak lightsaber fight between Luke and Kylo\\, and the vast amount of social justice forced into a lacking story are just some problems. Thank god I rented it from Redbox for a dollar fifty and not spend fifteen for a ticket.","true":true}
