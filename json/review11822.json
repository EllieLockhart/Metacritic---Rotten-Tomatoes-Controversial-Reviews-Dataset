Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How this has such a high critics score is beyond me only two Star Wars movies are worse than this\\, phantom menace and attack of the clones\\, let\u2019s start with the pointless merchandise opportunities (The Porgs\\, BB9\\, Phasma) all unnecessary and don\u2019t add to the story\\, as for the story with the exception of Kylo Ren there is no character growth and Kylo\u2019s is limited\\, it answers none of the questions left unanswered after the force awakens\\, the story is infantile with huge plot holes\\, I\u2019m not going to go into details as I don\u2019t believe in spoilers\\, Daisy Ridley\u2019s acting is atrocious\\, that said there are some good set pieces and action sequences although these alone get this to a measly 2.5 stars a lack of light sabre action is also disappointing ","true":true}
