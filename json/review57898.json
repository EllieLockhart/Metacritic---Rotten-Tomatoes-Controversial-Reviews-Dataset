Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disgrace that so many \\\"professional\\\" reviewers rated Last Jedi as \\\"fresh\\\"  Are they paid by Disney?  Or have they never seen a dramatic\\, well-written\\, well-acted movie?  Almost ANY television show from the space - sci-fi genre beats this by miles.  I had low expectations\\, and it STILL bored me to tears\\, with so many pointless\\, drawn-out scenes that had ZERO dramatic impact\\, and so much bad acting. The rebels were pathetic.  Even the bad guy was a wet noodle.   The force of good movie making is clearly not with Disney.  I miss George Lucas.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.  No matter how low your expectations\\, you will be disappointed.","true":true}
