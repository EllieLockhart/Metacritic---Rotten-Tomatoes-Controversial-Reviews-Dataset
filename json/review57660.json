Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally killed my enthusiasm for Star Wars...forever. Unless Kathleen Kennedy gets fired and a competent person becomes head of Lucasfilm\\, they never hire people like JJ Abrams and Mr. Rian 'Clueless' Johnson. Actually\\, forget it\\, there is no unless. They killed it. They had it at the right time\\, they had a great chance to end the main saga on the highest of notes and they blew it. Big Time. I will never give my money to Disney in any shape or form again because they need to feel what they've done to the fans fiscally. That's the only language they understand.","true":true}
