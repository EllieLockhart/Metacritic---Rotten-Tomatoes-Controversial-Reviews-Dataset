Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie manages to destroy everything that was good in star wars in 2 hours and 32 minutes. Luke Skywalker doesnt appear in this film at all. Zero screen time. Instead they have some bizzarro Luke Skywalker take his place. Keep the jokes away from this franchise. Too much estrogen just for the sake of it. Not cool! \\n\\nThe force being available to everyone \\\"is all around us\\\" is not a new concept. Anakin was a slave. Powerful female characters : Ashoka Tano\\, Chaak Ti\\, Jyn Erso\\, Princess Leia. Previous Star Wars movies didn't put down male characters to create strong female roles. Obi-Wan\\, Mace Windu\\, Anakin\\, Luke\\, Han Solo.. They can all coexist. Leave the politics propaganda out if the screen. \\n\\nNo character development\\, literally the story didnt move forward at all. These new characters are all trash. None of them are remotely relatable or intriguing. This movue sucks!!!!! Sucks!!! Save your money\\, go see Coco instead. Or Jumanji...","true":true}
