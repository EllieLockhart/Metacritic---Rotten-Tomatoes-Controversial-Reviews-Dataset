Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I made an account just so I can write a review. I\u2019m only about 5 hours into the game so take it with a grain of salt but I can agree with most of these reviews and am truly baffled by the number from the \u201ccritics\u201d giving this game a 95!  Honestly\\, I almost stopped playing after Joel was killed.  I almost threw up I was so disgusted with how ND decided to kill off probably the most loved character in gaming history.  Truly a slap in the face.It\u2019s also questionable\\, imo\\, to have such a \u201cwoke\u201d storyline.  Practically turning off most gamers.  I\u2019m not homophobic but I would appreciate if not everything in my life is someone\/something trying to push their progressive political views on me.If I wanted that **** in my life I would create a Twitter account and join the \u201cwoke\u201d\\, \u201ccancel-culture\u201d crowd of 20-30 year olds with a functioning brain power of 5 year olds.I\u2019ll finish the game no doubt\\, but I already know it will be forgotten in a week.  Unlike the first game that still brings up fond memories.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
