Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing is the worst i have ever seen in a movie. This movie destroyed what was left of the characters we love. The humor is often bad. It has way too much american political points for being a galaxy far far away. These new movies creates new force powers here and there and does a lot of new things that screws of the older movies. The special effects look good\\, the actors are fine but it's not enough to make a good movie and absolutely not enough to make a good star wars movie. Disney does not care about star wars at all\\, not the movies nor the games. When the hero of the franchise says he disagrees with everything you should really start thinking things through again. This movie is called the last jedi\\, there is no sith or characters you really care about anymore after the movie is finished so from now on there is no star wars to care about.","true":true}
