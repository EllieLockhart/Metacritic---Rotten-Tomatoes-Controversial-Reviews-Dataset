Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"I at one point had to say to Rian\\, 'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character.\\\" - Mark Hamill\\n\\nI agree with Mr. Hamill. I not only fundamentally disagree with every choice made for Luke. I fundamentally and wholeheartedly disagree with every choice made in this entire movie. This is NOT a Star Wars move. It's awful and has no substance. Rian is a terrible story writer and director. No I'm not a \\\"fanboy\\\"\\, no I'm not a \\\"hater\\\". I am a casual Star Wars fan at best\\, but I still enjoy the movies and franchise. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other movies that get bad reviews and no one calls those people \\\"haters\\\". It's a poor excuse to chalk up the bad reviews and the huge gap between critics and audiences to \\\"fanboys\\\" and \\\"haters\\\"\\, and say they're not important. This is just a terrible movie all around. Real people are reviewing this and sharing their feelings\\, not bots. I'm one of those real people. This movie is a joke. Just awful.","true":true}
