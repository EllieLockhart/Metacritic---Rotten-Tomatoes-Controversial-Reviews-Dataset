Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst in the franchise\\, but not great.  The acting was great and it had the most \\\"oh s*** moments\\\" of any film in the franchise\\, which is what saved it from being worse than Attack of the Clones.  But don't get it twisted\\, the plot\\, which is the most important element of the movie (to me) is the absolute worst in the franchise.  This is the only star wars movie that has ever left me feeling empty inside.  At least Attack of the Clones\\, the worst movie in the franchise\\, had a solid plot\\, just horrible acting and dialogue.  This movie is like a bad cake with great icing\\, basically.  But it also had a few \\\"WTF moments\\\" that almost negated the good moments.  There was one scene in this movie that was worse than anything Jar Jar ever did\\, but in case there are people who actually haven't seen it by now\\, I won't spoil it.  Overall\\, if this movie had a solid plot\\, it would be in the top 3.  But the plot was all but empty.  And boy\\, does Kylo Ren suck just as much as I've been saying he does for the last 2 years.  This movie confirmed that the current generation of force users are of a very VERY low quality.  Padawan Kenobi could've taken Kylo and Rey together and barely broken a sweat.  And that's worst case scenario for padawan Kenobi","true":true}
