Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot express how much the end of this movie angered me. Everything I had longed for in a Star Wars movie was swept away in one fell swoop. I have watched the original well over 100xs\\, read over 30 of the books in the series and named my son Benjamin after Obi Wan but because of the ending to this movie I will not be watching Episode IX","true":true}
