Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had mixed feeling after leaving the cinema\\, I didn't know how I felt\\, but the more I thought about the story\\, the more I disliked the direction they are taking the saga. \\n\\nThere were so many plot holes\\, unnecessary humor which took me out of the movie\\, it didn't leave me wanting more. So far before the Last Jedi\\, I was always extremely hyped for the next movie\\, this even included the prequels. But after the Last Jedi\\, I didn't feel at all excited about episode 9\\, the lack of any character development and the overpowered protagonist just killed me interest in Rey as a character. The line where \\\"when the dark rises\\, the light will come at meet it\\\" is lazy writing\\, pretty much used to explain Rey's overpowered abilities. A main character that seems perfect from the beginning is a boring character. \\n\\nWhen I first heard that Disney bought over star wars\\, I was stoked\\, as everything Disney touches turns into gold\\, I thought they will finally do Star Wars it's justice\\, but I was wrong. It is a terrible idea to allow a different director to write the story as it goes\\, story feels disjointed and the character traits just doesn't feel genuine.  As many people have mentioned\\, the useless scenes with Finn and Rose through the casino chase and finding the hacker should have been cut\\, the cheesy lines oh man thinking about them makes me so angry. There were so many scenes where characters did not seem to understand the seriousness of the situation and the lack of urgency\\, so they just stand around and have a nice chat :\/ \\n\\nI really hope they fix Star Wars\\, it's not going in a good direction at all.","true":true}
