Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the cloest film I've seen that is as good as Empire Strike Back\\, there are a few things I would have changed but they are minor compared to the beauty excellent story telling and just awesome new way they have moved Star Wars forward. This is the first time in ages I have been left not knowing what's coming next and having a sense of wonder and awe of the Force and myth behind Star Wars.","true":true}
