Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disregard for exposition\\, context\\, and character backstory leave audiences with a story that skirts by without creating any compelling or complete  \\n character arcs\\, motivations\\, or emotional beats.  Its not just disappointing for Star Wars fans\\, its disappointing for anybody who fans of thoughtful storytelling.","true":true}
