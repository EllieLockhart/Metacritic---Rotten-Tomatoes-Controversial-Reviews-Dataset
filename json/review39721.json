Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great addition to the Star Wars universe. I have been a fan my whole life and think Rian Johnson did a great job. Don\u2019t listen to the negative remarks by some fans\\, I saw it 3 times and it it fantastic!! They have done a great job and taken the series in a new direction. Wonderful cinematography\\, great action\\, good pacing and transitions. It might not be the answers some people were looking for and that is what disappoints them but what they have managed to accomplish is something great for the series overall. Really looking forward to where the series goes from here. Also\\, a beautiful nod to the original trilogy and SW lore.","true":true}
