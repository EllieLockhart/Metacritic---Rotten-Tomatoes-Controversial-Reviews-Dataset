Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, there's a lot of BS out there. Here's the real deal\\, according to...just me: this film is excellent and warrants multiple viewings (though multiple viewings are in no way required). It's not the fan service extravaganza I expected (The Force Awakens was\\, and I loved it)\\, but despite what some might say\\, Luke continues to be the ultimate hero; humanized\\, now\\, to whatever extent that's possible for a semi-god in a galaxy far\\, far away. \\n\\nJust plain great.","true":true}
