Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much wrong with this movie it's hard to decide where to begin. So I'll just give a basically a list of my main complaints. The first half of this film is a bloated\\, disjointed mess that has minimal influence over the second half of the film. The main conflict of the first half moves at a snails pace\\, apparently to give enough time for an additional handful of subplots that ultimately go nowhere. Character decisions must have been made based off a roll of the dice instead of the situations presented in the story. The few crumbs of character growth are forced and not natural. There seemed to be a push to add as much humor as possible\\, which most of the jokes were out of place and fell flat. On top of being just a bad movie in general\\, it also wasn't a very satisfying star wars movie. It has very little regard for any star wars material preceding it ( including TFA).  Characters don't behave as has been established\\, they don't use Star Wars \\\"physics\\\"\\,  OT characters are dispatched like they are in Game of Thrones. It doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. Which some may argue is a good thing but I can't agree that opinion. In summary this neither succeeded at being a good movie or an enjoyable Star Wars movie.","true":true}
