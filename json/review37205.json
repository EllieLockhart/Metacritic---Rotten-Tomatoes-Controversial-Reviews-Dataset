Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only way you can save Star Wars is in episode 9 it starts where episode 7 ended with Luke Skywalker and he wakes up and episode 8 was all a terrible nightmare. This option can save Disney from a disastrous  episode 9.The absolute disrespect to Luke Skywalker's character is unforgivable.","true":true}
