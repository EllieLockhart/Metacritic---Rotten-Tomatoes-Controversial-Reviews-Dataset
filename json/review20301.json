Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was terrible! So boring and very poorly written! Even Mark Hamill disagreed with the script and stated so to no avail. Such a huge disappointment! Luke dies and Lea lives when we all know in reality is the opposite. The whole thing is bad. 2 seconds Luke is cool & 2 seconds he only interacts with Lea. Huh? Audience was robbed of no Luke last film & NO screen time of our three fav characters together EVER! What a shame! The new Asian super boring nobody cares character steals ALL screen time with Finn. Rey needs no training but still has no attachment or heritage to Jedi's. Dumb! So dumb! I want my money & time wasted back! ","true":true}
