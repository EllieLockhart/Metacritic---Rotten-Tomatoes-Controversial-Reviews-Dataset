Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not like the plot.  The movie was done well with the SE and acting however the plot was terrible.  I was really let down and feel like the rest of the previous movies are basically not even relevant anymore.","true":true}
