Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, lazily directed\\, characters completely departed from who all prior films set them up to be; many storylines unnecessary and important\\, relevant ones were disregarded or dropped\\, and there were so many glaring holes in the plot that all suspension of disbelief was dropped. As a long time Star Wars fan who was excited for the new trilogy\\, this was immensely disappointing to me. The only time I have been more disappointed in a film I paid to see was Shymalan's Avatar: The Last Airbender. This film has singlehandedly managed to make Star Wars boring and predictable for me\\, and I will not be paying to go see any future Star Wars movies unless Disney rectifies this somehow.","true":true}
