Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where as The Force Awakens just play things safe and was just a bunch of mystery boxes\\, The Last Jedi actually focuses on making the new characters really matter in their own way without having to rely on old plot points from past films\\, Rian journeys the characters through new experiences\\, even old fan favorite characters like Luke are able to still develop in new ways\\, rather than stay their traiditional note. While not every character moment was a sure hit and sometimes the humor was misplaced in some moments\\, its still the most exciting star wars experience I felt since Disney started producing them. It's time to really start seeing new things and new perspectives on this universe.","true":true}
