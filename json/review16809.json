Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short\\, I agree with just about everything negative that's already been said. This movie has incredibly poor story telling and several plot holes that detract from the viewing experience. This site lost a lot of credibility with at least me for giving this movie a 91% rating.","true":true}
