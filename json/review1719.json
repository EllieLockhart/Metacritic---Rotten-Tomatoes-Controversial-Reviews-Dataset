Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a self-proclaimed\\, lifelong geek of multiple subjects\\, I possess a hybrid of expectations and anxieties when it comes to movies like these. However\\, this film successfully differentiates itself from all other films in the \\\"Star Wars\\\" canon by thankfully deviating from the formulaic plot devices so many of us have grown accustomed to and frankly bored by. The audience is provided with a certain level of fan service without being so heavily tied down by pandering nostalgia and coupled with a visually stunning experience\\, riveting answers\\, surprises\\, thrills\\, entertaining battles and surprises. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" achieves what some fans claimed that \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" failed to provide which is to deliver a novel\\, impactful story\\, and reinvention of the franchise\\, within the realm of the universe we all know\\, love and have grown up with.","true":true}
