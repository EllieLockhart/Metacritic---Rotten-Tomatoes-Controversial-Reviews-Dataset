Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an amazing addition to the Star Wars franchise. I hope that the disappointed fans will warm up to the movie eventually\\, and while there is alot of reasonable criticism\\, the blind hate against this film is unfounded. The characters are explored through all their vunerability\\, and it feels refreshing. I can't wait for Episode IX!","true":true}
