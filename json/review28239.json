Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, poorly executed story...and this series is ALL about story.  Disrespectful to SW Canon and original characters\\, and the director apparently doesn't understand how space works...LOL  This will be the LAST SW film I attend\\, and certainly would never actually purchase it.  Disney put the 'J' in SW.","true":true}
