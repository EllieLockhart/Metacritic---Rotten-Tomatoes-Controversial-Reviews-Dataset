Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is great because it gives so much more story to the new trilogy. The story is packed behind everything you are seeing on the screen. For example: Snoke isn't dead because he's stronger in the force then Luke and could realistically force Display himself and fake his own death. He's lived since the old republic and isn't a Sith Lord or a Jedi!","true":true}
