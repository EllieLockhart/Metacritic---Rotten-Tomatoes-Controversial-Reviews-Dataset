Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social Justice Wars: The Phantom Plotlines.\\n\\nThis movie was absolute garbage and if it's any indication of what's to come\\, Disney should just allow Star Wars to die the dignified death it deserves. \\n\\nCharacter development was non existent\\, empty\\, hollow\\, which was worsened by poor acting. None of the characters brought anything to the film other than the ability to fill each diversity checkbox. Who was snoke? Who were Rey's Parents? killing off Luke? really??? \\n\\nTFA was much better and much more canon and set up a number of questions that SHOULD have been answered by this dumpster fire of a film\\, rather all this film did was answer none of them\\, leave the audience with even MORE unanswered questions thanks to the excessive number of plot holes and continuity problems... \\n\\nIt's quite clear from this film that the direction disney plan's on taking this franchise is the direction of the Marvel films.... The 'Call of Duty' of films if you will. Same excessive CGI explosion fest rehashed over and over again that is guaranteed to sell because of the name slapped on it... Why disney\\, why did you have to kill our childhood?","true":true}
