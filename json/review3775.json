Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between Luke Skywalkers cowardice\\, finding our hero suckling at the teet of an alien space cow\\, yoda the book burner?\\, Laura Dern's purple commadress hotttie-fly-boy commentary\\, Leia going all Kal-El\\, a shirtless Kylo Ren\\, sub-plots of sobplotted sub-plots\\, Rey who?\\, this movie was exhausting. The only redeeming quality was the music of John Williams. All in all\\, this movie Sucked!","true":true}
