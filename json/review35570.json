Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a complex\\, sprawling\\, even inconsistent film. And yet\\, it's great\\, because it's exactly what the franchise needed\\, just as Rogue One was last year. It's savvy to contemporary issues and politics\\, inclusive\\, and most of all\\, really means it when it says that you have to let the past die. The performances and action sequences are moving\\, the score is great\\, and the story is thorough. Best of all\\, we now have no real idea what to expect in Episode IX\\, which is as it should be.","true":true}
