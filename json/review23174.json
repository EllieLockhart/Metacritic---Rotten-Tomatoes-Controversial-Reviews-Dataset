Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Fresh and new from a great director and great staff. Too bad a film this new and fresh was given to a fan base who LITERALLY hates fresh and new. ","true":true}
