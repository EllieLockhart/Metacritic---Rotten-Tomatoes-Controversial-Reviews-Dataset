Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm Star Wars' number one fan and I don't wan't to even say this but this film was the worst in the franchise\\, I wanted to like it... But it just left me kind of angry. The reason I'm not writing a passionate\\, long\\, angry review is because a lot of other fans agree with me. Sadly this is a huge let down and I really don't even care about  episode 9. Sure I'm going to see it opening day (mostly because Daisy Ridley is my new Hollywood crush\\, then again that might change in a couple years\\, never mind this is beside the point) but all I'm all I'm unamused and disappointed in the sloppy writing and delivery of this film.","true":true}
