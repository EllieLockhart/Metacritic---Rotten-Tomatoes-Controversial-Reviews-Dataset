Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't go to the theater to have someones idea of a PC world shoved down my throat and that is what I got. Weak story line left me wondering again and again\\, \\\"Why did they do this or that\\\". Half way through movie I kept wondering when would this torture end.  All the time thinking that this is not Lucas's vision leaving me sick to my stomach enduring till the credits rolled. I walked out thinking that the next episode will not be worth the purchase of a ticket. Who made this mess?\\nOne last bit of comments before leaving Star Wars in the past unless in the unlikely event that Disney replaces those who purposely wizzed on the fans faces. Make no mistake about the intent of the directors. It is not like Kathleen and co. all of the sudden forgot how to make a good movie. Rest assure that this gal gets a raging hard-on from every negative review confirming to her that the mission was a complete success. Which mission is to get on screen all of the SJW PC BS possible sticking it to the fans which is really just sticking it to George's baby (don't think for one moment that Mr. Lucas does not know this) and laughing all the way to the bank.","true":true}
