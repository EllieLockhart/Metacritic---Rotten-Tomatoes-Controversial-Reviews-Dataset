Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't even know where to start in this review. TFA was at least comfy\\, this movie on the other hand was a total mess. The director\\, for some obscure reason\\, decided to subvert expectations for the sake of it\\, completely ignoring little cues left behind from JJ. Rey's parentage? Please. Anyone remembers Rey's flashback?","true":true}
