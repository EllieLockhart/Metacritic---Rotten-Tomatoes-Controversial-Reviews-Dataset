Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The majority of my issues with this movie revolve around diction used. The script writing felt lazy\\, and used 2017 American diction (e.g. \\\"God's speed\\\") that was not authentic to the Star Wars Universe. Moreover\\, this is movie #2 of the new trilogy and felt like it took place over a few hours. We're talking about a galactic war here and the story feels like it barely moved along. If this had been a standalone film\\, or there was no limit to the story\\, maybe it would be okay. Overall\\, the storytelling just wasn't up to par. \\n\\n\\nLastly\\, there are a ton of questions that were INTENTIONALLY raised in The Force Awakens that were cast aside here. Sure\\, some of my reaction is from having high expectations\\, but I waited over 6 months to ponder and re-watch and had the same issues. \\n\\nPositive note: acting was great\\, visual effects were amazing as always\\, Rey is a badass\\, there was a phenomenal action sequence with Rey and Kylo.","true":true}
