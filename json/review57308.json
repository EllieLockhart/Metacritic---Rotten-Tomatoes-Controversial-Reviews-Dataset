Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie is enjoyable\\, but flawed. When i watched it\\, I thought it was good. But it could be improved.\\nFirst\\, we should've been some small hint on Snoke's backstory. This isn't a major point\\, but this would've been a bigger shock.\\nSecond\\, and this is one big bug bear even I have\\, Finn was a wasted character. I would've loved to have seen more connections of his First Order past\\, which has been glossed over. The Cantobyte act was unnecessary.\\nThird\\, Rey. This movie has enforced her as a Mary Sue character. However\\, I think that she being related to a character in the originals would make her even more Mary Sue. I think her character's immense ability to use the force and skills need to be sussed out cleverly.\\nLast\\, the Resistance fleeing the First order. It's not a bad scene\\, but it didn't make sense how that Admiral woman didn't tell anyone her plan (if she had a plan\\, which I think she didn't). If Admiral Ackbar was in that place\\, it would've been fitting.\\nHowever\\, there are good things. The acting and visuals were stunning and Kylo Ren has a villain arc which is amazing. I think the change in Luke Skywalker's character is realistic and was different from just having him the same way. In the next movie\\, I would like to see it tie everything together and try not to waste all the assets which it could've been using.\\nI don't think it's a bad movie\\, it's just flawed. And it's sad to see a fanbase so divided over one movie.","true":true}
