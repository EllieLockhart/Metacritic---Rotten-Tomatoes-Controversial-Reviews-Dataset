Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very dissapointing. Opening sequence was great but it started falling apart after that. I liked some of the prequels better than this and those were at the bottom of my list for Star Wars movies. Visually there were a lot of cool things going on but the story just wasn't very good and at the end nothing really advanced with the characters and you know no more than what you did at the end of episode 7 and it makes the movie pointless in a lot of ways. It is going to be hard to salvage things with episode 9 after that mess.","true":true}
