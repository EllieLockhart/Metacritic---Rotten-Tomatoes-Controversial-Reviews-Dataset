Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of all eight episodes this is my second favorite along side Empire Strikes Back. It reignited my love for Star Wars as well the film transported me back to when I was nine years old and saw the films for the first time.","true":true}
