Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had soul crushing moments and my heart beat spiked more than a few times. The movie has some obvious problems. Reylo is life and confirmed. Our twin siblings finally reunited was perfection. Luke deserved better. He deserved an epic story. And that didn't come through.","true":true}
