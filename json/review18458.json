Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is inspiring to see all these five star reviews on this site after it was relentlessly brigades by angry fan boys for months. They still show up in waves to protect their moronic audience poll. This film is fantastic.","true":true}
