Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is a very good star wars movie and well deserves a 93%. highly recommend watching. this movie is a great addition to the franchise. directors were not afraid to take risks and executed  everything pretty well. this movie does a good job to connecting to all of the super fans out there and most of the criticism comes from those that barely know whats going on in the universe.","true":true}
