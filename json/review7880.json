Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excitement falls flat\\, throws legendary characters to the wind instead of holding the legacy. Jokes are great but not in every scene. Decides to ignore most of the set up from Force awakens. Literally the movie would have been over in the beginning if Vice Admiral Holdo just told her people her plan\\, and di would have never had the chance to rat out the rebels and everyone would have made it to safety ","true":true}
