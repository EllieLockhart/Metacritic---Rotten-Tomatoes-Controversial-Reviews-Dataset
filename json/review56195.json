Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans\\, preserve your love for this franchise and stay at home. This is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made; for me\\, it's also the worst movie I've seen in years. The critic reviews for this piece of crap baffle me. \\n\\nThe new characters are one-dimensional\\, vacuous\\, and sometimes irritating (Rose). Worse\\, our fave legacy characters are carelessly inserted with new characterizations that depart from well-established personas we've known and cherished for decades (Luke). Horrible dialogue\\, lazy script-writing\\, forced political commentary (that does not serve these legitimate issues justice)\\, and mostly ill-timed\\, tasteless humor. So many plot holes and narrative laziness that I swear this movie could be used in a film class to explain the concept of 'deus ex machina.' Sadly\\, it will be difficult to unremember this horrible addition to the Star Wars franchise. Shame on you Rian Johnson for completely disregarding the Star Wars canon and slapping so many fans in the face. 55% audience score is not a triumph.","true":true}
