Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed VII.  It felt like a return to form for Star Wars.  Even though the story was very similar to IV\\, it still set up VIII to be an interesting story.  In the prequels\\, even though they were pretty bad\\, I never left the theater disappointed.  This is the first Star Wars movie that\\, when it was over\\, I felt let down. Hopefully JJ can save the trilogy\\, and I'm glad he's doing IX\\, but Rian should be fired and a restraining order put on him by the Star Wars Franchise.","true":true}
