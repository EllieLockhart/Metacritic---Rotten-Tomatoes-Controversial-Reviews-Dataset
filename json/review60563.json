When it comes to dialogue and acting Naughty Dog remains unequaled.\r\rI bought the game on release and am currently halfway through my second play-through and still havnt encountered a single bug or glitch. Also\\, there are NO in-game loading screens. A breath of fresh air compared to most releases we have seen this late in the PS4s lifecycle.\r\rThe game-play is great with intense action that sometimes feels almost scripted\\, partly due to superb ai. You can tell that a lot of effort has gone into \\\"quality of life\\\" adjustments making for a really smooth and satisfying game-play experience.\r\rI recommend turning the difficulty settings up one step from what you are used to. Or atleast to turn up the difficulty slider for Player\\, Allies and Resources. For me Hard represented what I expect Normal to be.\r\rOverall its hands down one of the best games I have ever played.\r\rMost of my criticism comes down to nitpicking or personal preferance but here goes:\r- I dont like playable flashbacks or playing different characters\\, it brings me out if the story. I would have prefered if some of these parts of the game was replaced with cut scenes.\r- I would have preferred more focus on building an adventure compared to telling a complex story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
