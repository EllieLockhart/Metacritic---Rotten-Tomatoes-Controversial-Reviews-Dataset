{"101487":175218,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a movie filled with intense action and thrilling moments\\, yet falls short with a low-grade. one-dimensional copy of The Empire Strikes Back Story.\\n\\nLet's start with positives. The movie is visually impressive and looks beautiful\\, nothing more I can say on that front. The Action of the story is great\\, I felt suspense the entire time during the action segments\\, feeling the intense heat of the moment\\, almost as if I was there... For the most part. The Big problem with the action is that instead of ending them in glorious moments and epic finishes\\, almost all of them end in disappointing finishes that kill the mood of the action and take all the setup for a climax of action away. Consequently\\, this causes the plot to drag on and become predictable and boring due to the same formula of suspense followed by a mood-killing action playing out every time except for the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie.\\n\\nNext\\, we move on to the characters. Like The Force Awakens\\, Characters are a major weak point. Rey and Luke are the only characters to develop any throughout this entire movie. Unfortunately\\, there was no effort to give any background info for any of the characters except Kylo Ren. We still don't know who Rey is or why she can use the force very well with next to no training. Finn and Po\\, as well as Rose go through multiple plot threads that end up being pointless as they experience no development what so ever\\, it felt as if they're roles were simply there to cause filler action for the plot.  Luke does have a good character throughout the movie and by the end becomes a complete character\\, He was the best character of the Movie. Kylo Ren\\, while his backstory is revealed\\, has much setup for development\\, but like most action in this movie is thrown all away at one moment\\, wasting all the potential the plot thread had. Leila didn't change at all\\, mainly due to her being extremely minor in the movie. Lastly\\, though\\, the worst case in Supreme Leader Snoke who has so much mysterious setup that made fans love Darth Vader and The Emperor in previous installments... It was all wasted (Won't explain though due to spoilers). Overall\\, the characters in The Last Jedi are\\, for the most part\\, either either wasted potential or completely unnecessary filler doing events because they have no baring on the main plot due to their actions having no affect at all on the plot\\n\\nThe Story is alright at best. While it is suspenseful and dramatic and had me interested in parts\\, still had many flaws. The main problem that I've already stated is how it drags on and has a lot of filler for most of the movie. The plot can be divided into three plot sections: Beginning\\, Middle (The Longest) And End. The Plot takes place mostly in the middle section with the same plot point taking over. The Biggest Problem with this section\\, the majority of the movie\\, is that it is full of filler. Rey's side of the story during this phase is fine\\, however on the other character's side\\, it is a long journey that ends up having no effect on the plot as the effects of the hero's actions do not change where the plot leads at all. It would have made no difference if the characters stood around and did nothing\\, the only positive of the filler is the action. The Beginning was great with much action and direction\\, as well as no action interpreters\\, making the efforts of the heroes actually mean something (Which is quickly met the cliche reaction by the cast that it wasn't worth it because people died). The Ending was alright with a pretty epic climax\\, the only problem being the poor characters and predictability. That Last issue I need to address is just how slow it is\\, which I have yet to explain. The Last Jedi has no direction at all\\, it feels that the same conflicts happen over and over and over again... and that's because that is the case exactly. The entire movie is The First Order strikes and narrowly kills all of the resistance. The Resistance then barely escapes only to be found again\\, thus the process repeats. This same formula is the entire conflict and the only difference is how it plays out each time. Otherwise\\, the same concept is used over and over and over again. All other conflicts are minor threads within the major conflict.\\n\\nLastly\\, I'll talk about what I stated in the opening\\, how this movie is essentially a copy cat of The Empire Strikes Back. What do both movies have in common? Bascially everything. In both movies the main protagonist is away for most of movie being trained and comes back at the end to face the villain and ultimately has a victory for the good guys. Both Movies feature a clear and majority victory for the Bad Guys and dark moments for most of the cast until the very end. The only difference is that The Empire Strikes Back executes it much better with developed\/developing characters\\, Direction of Plot\\, and Suspenseful Moments that live up to the setup.\\n\\nOverall\\, The Last Jedi doesn't live up to any of the hype set up by The Force Awakens and sets up a wild horse with little potential to make Episode 9 any better. The Great Action and intense Thrills\\, as well as amazing visuals and sound quality give this movie many points for the half of the battle in sacrefice of the other half composed of the story elements. The Last Jedi is alright\\, while extremely dissapointing with horid reactions from the hard core fans\\, isn't the worst movie to exist\\, but it's laziness to create an exciting plot to live up to The Force Awakens forces this movie to fall to a mediocre 2.5\/5","true":true}
