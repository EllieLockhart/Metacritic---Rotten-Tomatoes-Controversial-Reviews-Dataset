Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember when Luke Skywalker was awesome and was constantly learning and growing.  I like this new Luke that is milking sea cows and sits on an island all by himself the whole time and being near zero value to the Universe.  He might as well just thrown himself on the fire at the end of Episode 6.\\nAlso\\, the lack of leadership is seen throught this movie.  Leia shows almost no leadership ability\\, her replacement shows even less leadership\\, Only Poe Damron has anysense of leadership during the entire movie.","true":true}
