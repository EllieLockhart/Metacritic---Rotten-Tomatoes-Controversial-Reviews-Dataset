Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad story structure. Too long. Full of product placement. It's time for Star Wars to end.\\nI liked The Force Awakens. Even though it was not a perfect movie\\, it set up story arcs that I was excited about. TLJ took a massive dump on those arcs. The movie was a mess. It not only destroyed what the previous movie created\\, it ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. It's pointless\\, inconsistent\\, and awkwardly tries to recreate the original trilogy by artificially resetting the universe to the same state.\\nDon't bother.","true":true}
