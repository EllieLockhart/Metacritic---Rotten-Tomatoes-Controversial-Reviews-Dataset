Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan myself\\, I'd want nothing more than to love this movie but the excessive plot holes\\, poorly written dialogue\\, unusual character decisions and numerous other weak points makes this a less than average action title that spends 2 and a half hours doing nothing.","true":true}
