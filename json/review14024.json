Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you liked Guardians of the Galaxy\\, you'll love The Last Jedi. Dialogue excerpt:\\nPoe: Quick\\, BB-8.
