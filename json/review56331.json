Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure this movie has Star Wars in the title and several beloved characters from the franchise. But in NO way does this feel like a Star Wars film! You can't have a scene where bombs are falling in space to a scene with Leah in zero gravity! We've all accepted over the years that these gravity exists in space and that tie fighters and xings can turn on a dime. But now suddenly Leah is floating away in space and does a Mary Poppins and flies back to the ship? Totally takes you out of the movie! And speaking of Mary's how bout Rey? The Mary Sue of this new trilogy? Where is her struggle? She's just so naturally gifted she can beat Luke and Kylo without any training? This is lazy and uninteresting story telling! Disney should be ashamed of themselves for hiring a hack who doesn't even understand the mythology of Star Wars. This idea that they are trying to appeal to a younger audiance is obsurd! These films do that naturally and organically. You don't need to dumb it down for millennials\\, they will get on board reguardless. Besides parents have been taking their kids to see these movies for 30 years! With each new generation of fans joining the ranks. Horrible filmmaking!","true":true}
