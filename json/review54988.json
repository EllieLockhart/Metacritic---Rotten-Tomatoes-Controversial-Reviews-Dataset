Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was entertaining\\, but it wasn't Star Wars. Missed a huge opportunity to enhance the franchise. Reye did not train to become a Jedi like Luke did. Took a number of opportunities to shove the popular opinions of the day into a scene where it had no place. The intimate conversations and wisdom between shared in older movies was non existent. Luke was nothing but a shadow of himself where he should have been positioned as the next Yoda. Luke's mistake was that becoming a Jedi required seeking\\, not forced training like he did in the past. Could have capitalized on the concept. The only memorable qoute was from Yoda - you are what you grow beyond. ","true":true}
