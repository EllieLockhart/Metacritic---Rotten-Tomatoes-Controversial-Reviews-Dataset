Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It absolutely baffles me how people think this movie is good. There are too many lazy plot holes and social messages that are too in your face to ignore. My initial issues after seeing the movie: 1. Leia flying through space - this was just absurd 2. Rey\u2019s parentage reveal - I didn\u2019t love this but can understand why they did it. It\u2019s not a huge gripe of mine. 3. Snoke\u2019s death\/lack of backstory - offing Snoke like they did just makes him a completely worthless character in my eyes. Also just not acknowledging his backstory and where he cane from is just lazy. Sith lords don\u2019t just appear out of thin air. 4. The entire \u2018master code breaker\u2019 storyline - this is one of the biggest issues. An absolute misery that this was allowed to be put on the screen. Utterly worthless\\, only In the movie to hammer across the \u2018force is for everyone\u2019 message that was shoved down peoples\u2019 throat. 5. The First Order waiting for resistance fuel to run out 6. No saber fight 7. Vice admiral not telling Poe about her plan 8. FO tracking ships through light speed 9. ","true":true}
