Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's brilliance revives this franchise for me. This movie truly made me love Star Wars with every fiber of my being. Visually stunning and intimate\\, this movie made me feel like a true Star Wars movie should; hopeful and like I was a part of something bigger than myself. Packed full with symbolism and parallels\\, in-depth character development\\, and a moral to this story that resonates with people of all walks of life. Anyone can be a hero. \\nI can't say enough about this film. Every time I watch it\\, I find something new that I didn't notice before that enhances the story. It's tragic that some fans don't appreciate this movie for the creative genius it is.","true":true}
