Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In interviews prior to this movie\\, Mark Hamill said the script surprised him. Not in a bad way. Having seen this (twice\\, now\\, once to get the \\\"ooh new shiny\\,\\\" once to pay attention\\,) I can say yes\\, it is surprising. Yes\\, quite a bit of speculation was... to paraphrase Luke\\, \\\"every word in that theory was wrong.\\\" (I said paraphrase.) \\n\\nI have grown up with Star Wars. As a kid I saw it in the theaters when it first came out. I've gone to day one showings of the prequels\\, and to this. The prequels were well and truly roasted\\, and with good reasons - though not all those reasons have stood up over time\\, some of the acting and direction and such made them poor entries even as they told a needed story. For these? Yes\\, the Force Awakens was very much a tip of the hat back to A New Hope. This really starts pushing things its own way\\, while still touching enough \\\"beats\\\" of the old one to recall the \\\"cyclical\\\" themes and nature of the story. \\n\\nAnd the story IS making its own way\\, breaking away from the \\\"Skywalker story\\\" even as it passes its torch to the new generation. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is probably tied as second-most-favourite Star Wars movie with Rogue One (another one so-called \\\"hardcore fans\\\" seemed to hate.) It'll take a lot to knock Empire off that top spot\\, though. \\n\\nGO SEE IT.","true":true}
