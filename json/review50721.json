Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A absolute travesty to Star Wars canon\\, the characters involved\\, the legacy\\, the technology.  It is heartbreaking and depressing to feel this way about Star Wars.  Rian Johnson intentionally ruined everything the books\\, the original movies\\, and even JJ Abrahm's Episode VII set up for the future.  A rape of everything that is sacred about Star Wars.","true":true}
