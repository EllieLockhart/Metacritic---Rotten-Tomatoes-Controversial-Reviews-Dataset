Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as I enjoyed The Force Awakens and was very excited to see this movie\\, I was left disappointed and heartbroken. They disrespected my childhood hero Princess Leia by making her awkwardly fly through space\\, they destroyed the beautiful character of Luke Skywalker that was so carefully created by George Lucas. Luke was the hero everyone could relate to. Inspite of being a Women I was disappointed in Rey and Kylo's character development\\, Rey is hard to relate to because she's great at everything\\, I'm a women I KNOW i'm not good at everything. Kylo was not scary or intimidating at all and it's hard to invest in a villain that is always going to lose. People keep saying that we're just bots but I can guareentee I'm a real human\\, This movie is awful and I won't spend any more money on Star Wars until Krazy Kathleen and Rian Johnson never get to put their grimmy mits on our beloved franchise again. \\n\\nAnd if Disney doesn't want to listen to us the fans\\, then well my hundreds of dollars I spend on Star wars will go elsewhere\\, No Problem.","true":true}
