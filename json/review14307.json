Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew out of being a Star Wars fan years ago\\, when the Ewoks first showed their furry faces\\, but I forced myself to go see this movie so that I could at least talk knowledgeably about it with others. Surprisingly\\, I rather enjoyed it. It wasn't the fast-paced mishmash of hollow action scenes that I expected. Instead\\, the movie took its time to explore its characters and build an emotional arc.","true":true}
