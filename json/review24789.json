Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Multiple flaws in the plot. If you are a true Star Wars fan prepare to be extremely disappointed\\, on the other hand if this is the first Star Wars movie you've seen it's an OK movie at best. The movie is very long and was drug out. Spoiler alert.... the movie could have been about 30 min shorter if Poe would have been informed of the plan and not have had to come up with his own by sending Flynn and rose on what was a pointless and stupid mission. Overall extremely disappointed.","true":true}
