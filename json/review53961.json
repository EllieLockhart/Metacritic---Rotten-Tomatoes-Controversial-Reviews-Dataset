Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, my entire life I wanted to see George Lucas make episode 7\\, 8 and 9.\\n I started to lose hope as I got older so I began to read the books put out by Timothy's Zahn which continued the series.  I think it was every Star Wars fans dream to see what Jedi master Luke Skywalker not look like\\, what kind of powers he would have\\, what he would be like as a teacher etc.  I could not have been more excited about going to the theater after episode seven.   Although I knew they would kill off on solo in episode seven I was truly hopeful to see the new generation of Star Wars mix with the old generation\\, as every Star Wars fan knows look skywalker is at the epicenter of it all.  The feeling of my heart sinking slowly as I continue to sit through episode eight was almost unbearable.   I was holding out hope that they would not kill off Luke\\, that we would get to see what Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was and what kind of a teacher he could become.   I was so excited to see his relationship with Rey form and watch as he took her through the motions of becoming a great Jedi.  This movie was beyond disappointing\\, from princess Leia flying through space after being dead\\, to watching my hero  Luke Skywalker not use the force throughout the whole movie\\, finally to see him use the force at the end and tell Kylo Ren that he will be seeing him later\\, only 2 feet away and die a minute later.  To watching a pointless casino scene\\, trying to figure out who this villain  supreme leader smoke was without any backstory... Only to be killed quickly and not have a purpose...   To introducing this rose character that somehow loves Finn??  Creating a ridiculous love triangle that makes no sense??  Watching Luke whine about the Jedi order and his mistakes for nearly 2 hours\\, then Rey all the sudden having enough training and power to move   100 huge rocks and boulders for the resistance to escape...   Remember that Luke did not train her at all... So how she knows how to be a Jedi or control the force is anyone's guess... \\n I hate you Disney for ruining the most pure and magical storytelling journey of my childhood\\, I hate you for ruining Luke Skywalker and who he could have become.  To anyone that gave this movie a good review\\, you were never a true Star Wars fan\\, the ultimate backstory\\, good and evil epic storytelling ruined.","true":true}
