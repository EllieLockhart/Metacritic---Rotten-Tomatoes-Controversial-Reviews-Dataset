Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never had a rotten tomatoes account but I specifically signed up to write this review. Why is there any division on this movie? TLJ was so poorly written\\, it's laughable. (Spoilers) You don't even have to look at the issues with Star Wars cannon or SJW political agenda. There were so many plot holes that the movie was impossible to take seriously. This was just a super slow spaceship race. It was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a sci-fi movie. Why would you let the escape pods be destroyed for so long before sacrificing yourself? Not to mention\\, that the first order was destroying a ship a second and there was a 15 minute lightsaber battle occurring while that was happening. How did any ships even get away in time for the stupid light speed weapon to be used? And what was the point of the codebreaker thing anyway? What a collosal waste of time. I've heard people explaining that this movie was about making mistakes and learning from them but why did I bother sitting through an over 2 hour movie to accomplish nothing except - now they have hope? I actually really enjoyed the Force Awakens and I was looking  forward to this follow up. Now I could really care less about episode 9. \\n\\nUgh. I want my 2.5 hours back.","true":true}
