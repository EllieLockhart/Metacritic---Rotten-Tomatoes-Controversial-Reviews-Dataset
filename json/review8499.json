Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finn got next to no screentime and close to no actual heroic moments- a major letdown. Poe\\, Rey\\, and Luke \\\"I know there is good in you\\\" Skywalker are drastically and offensively mischaracterized. The central conflict could have been avoided with a few words of communication\\, but it ended up nearly destroying the resistance and made Finn\\, Rose\\, and Poe look like idiots. Spent half the movie focusing on Kylo and couldn't even make him interesting. I honestly think Attack of the Clones was a better movie.","true":true}
