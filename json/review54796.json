Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that this is a really good movie. I think what it did really well was introduce me to new things. I believe that you shouldn't have expectations for what a movie should be and you should go in and enjoy and if you didn't enjoy it then it's fine. This movie made me love Luke Skywalker more because it makes the hero feel more real and relatable. I like Poe's leadership arc\\, and while Finn's subplot wasn't really good his arc was. Rey and Kylo Ren are interesting in how they interact and how they are basically two sides of the same coin. I liked how in this similarly to Empire everyone fails spectacularly\\, yet they still fight\\, not just from Finn\\, Rey\\, and Poe but also Kylo and even Snoke to a lesser extent and he didn't fight.. Leia\\, Phasma\\, and Hux weren't used as much as I thought they should have been\\, but I'm fine with that for the most part. The way some characters were handled and the casino scenes\\, not the Star Destroyer scenes\\, were my gripes. Overall this is one of the best Star Wars movies to date.","true":true}
