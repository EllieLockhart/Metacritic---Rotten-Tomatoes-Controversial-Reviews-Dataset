Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When marketers were putting together ad campaigns they decided to emphasize \u201cDon\u2019t Let Anyone Spoil This Movie.\u201d This is an indication that there are going to be some unexpected things in the movie. In one of the spots Luke says \u201cThis is not going to go the way you think.\u201d It certainly did not. While the Star Wars Universe remained true to form\\, this movie expanded the Universe. The force is used in ways that we haven\u2019t seen before. New characters are encountered and new locations explored. If you are a person who is sensitive and overly critical about making fictional movies more realistic\\, save some money and your sanity. However\\, if you can enjoy a movie without over-thinking it\\, this is a great escape.","true":true}
