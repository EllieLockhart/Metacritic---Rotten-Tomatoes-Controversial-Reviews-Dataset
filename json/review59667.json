Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"With an impeccable graphic presentation\\, pushing the Ps4 to the limit\\, TLOU 2 brings a mixed feeling.The gameplay\\, almost identical to the original game\\, remains current and fluid. Exploration gained greater prominence\\, bringing more open areas providing a broader perspective of the reality of the universe in which the story takes place.The plot is not well tied. Forgetting everything that was built in the first episode\\, especially the characteristics and the relationship of the people.I understand the idea of \u200b\u200busing revenge as the driving force of history\\, but not even his initial tip-foot is sustained. The intelligence of the players is almost a debauchery. The characters who join this sequel really seem to pertrade the reality of the game.The idea of \u200b\u200bbringing the villain's perspective is **** Using this artifice\\, we are stuck in this narrative wearing the fluidity from the story\\, making it tiring.I believe that the biggest problem of the game is its outcome.After everything the player goes through\\,after all the challenges and losses Ellie has to deal with\\, failure to take revenge makes the journey seem empty and in vain.Sad that a franchise that would not need a sequence has won one that deconstructs everything that was appreciated by its audience\u2026 Expand","true":true}
