Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As as die hard Star Wars fan\\, I want to like this movie\\, but I can't shake the feeling that I've come away deeply disappointed. I feel that so many elements of the original and new franchise were mishandled or poorly executed. I'm shocked at the lack of critical reviews from the media. I have to choke back the bile to admit that I feel as though I walked away from The Phantom Menace with a more positive feeling than I did with The Last Jedi. Perhaps my sense of this movie will change after the second viewing (for which I\\, unfortunately\\, already have tickets).","true":true}
