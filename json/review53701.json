Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun for the kiddies and many casual viewers; but for adults and fans of the franchise in particular\\, this film is a hot mess: a poorly paced series of plot holes and lazy writing which ultimately fails to develop the vastly unexplained narrative context of Episode Seven while sealing the unheroic and undeveloped fate of the original trilogy heroes\\, leaving fans and casual viewers alike with less compelling replacement heroes and villains operating in a Star Wars franchise absent any coherent\\, unifying vision.","true":true}
