Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back is probably the best episode of them all because you really cared about the characters. The relationship between Han and Leia plus the relationship between Luke\\, Obi Wan Kenobi\\, and Yoda. Even Vader was portrayed seamlessly as a strong mature evil mastermind. It's obvious that the writers were using Empire Strikes Back as a template for this story. I can only image this is how the conversation went:\\n\\nwriter 1: we need to remake Empire Strikes Back\\, that was a good movie\\n\\nWriter 2: yeah but we got in trouble for remaking A New Hope\\n\\nwriter 1: ok so let's just flip it around\\n\\nwriter 2: what you mean have the base battle before the space chase\\n\\nwriter 1: yeah\\, we'll just throw the characters in wherever they fit\\n\\nwriter 2: ok but we can't forget any characters\\, we need Rey\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, Kylo\\, and Poe.  I feel like I'm missing someone. Oh well\\, well make up for whatever we miss later with convenient plot holes.\\n\\nsix months later....\\n\\nwriter 2: crap I forgot Finn\\, let's give him a meaningless storyline that doesn't affect the outcome of anything so we don't have to re-write what we already wrote\\n\\nwriter 1: that works\\, no one will notice it's just meaningless crap to fill space to avoid having to do real writing and character development.\\n\\nBad writing is what ruined this movie even for the casual viewer. This was my wife's first Star Wars experience and one of the first things she said about it is that she never found out who all the people were and was confused about why there was that whole scene at the casino. The only thing she likes were the scenes with Rey\\, Luke\\, and sometimes Kylo.\\n\\nAll the bad writing aside the special effects were great\\, even the ones that made gravity and sound come and go in outer space depending on the writers needs at the moment.\\n\\nI can't wait for someone to get a full count on the plot holes in this movie\\, it has to be in the hundreds.","true":true}
