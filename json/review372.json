As a lover of horror movies\\, when I found out I could play through one\\, I was setting aside the cash months in advance to be sure I was ready for this gem when it came out.\r\rI wasn't disappointed.\r\rUntil Dawn puts you in control of 8 friends who reunite at a mountain retreat a year after a horrible event. These character range from the typical \\\"geek\\\"\\, the prom queen\/king archetype characters\\, the jock and the rationale girl who\\, in a typical horror movie\\, you would deem as the \\\"final girl\\\". The great thing about this game is that anyone can be the \\\"final girl\/guy\\\" and any of them can die.\r\rAnd because this game is filled with characters that you will undoubtedly grow to like and some you will despise (yes\\, I had one in particular)\\, it may be in your best interest to put your personal feelings aside because this game may tempt you to let some meet their fates\\, but in doing so can seriously impact the progression of the story.\r\rThis game uses a Butterfly Effect system. Much like the horrible Ashton Kutcher movie\\, this means that choices you make as one character during one scene can impact that character later on either positively or negatively. But it can also have an impact on other characters in scenes later in the game. This\\, of course\\, makes the replay value that much higher. It will make you want to go back and play through again and make different choices to see the various outcomes. Beware though. This game constantly saves (almost like it's recording it as it you play). This means if something goes wrong\\, there is no reloading the last checkpoint in an attempt to do-over. If your favorite character meets their grisly fate\\, oh well. Better latch on to a new character and do your best to keep them alive.\r\rThe story is pretty clich\u00e9 in its execution. A bunch of crazy kids go to a mountain retreat to have what could be their last hoorah after a tragic event from the previous year left them all somber. Horror ensues\\, people die\\, love can blossom and stupid dialogue is spoken. The acting is decent\\, considering some of these people are relatively unknown\\, and some even outshine the more well-known actors (yes\\, Hayden Panettiere\\, you needed to do better in some scenes). The maniac stalking you wears a creepy mask and\\, of course\\, the game provides decent jump scares.\r\rAs far as the actual action of the game\\, much of it involves walking and exploring the really graphically beautiful areas looking for clues as to who the madman is as well as why the events of the previous year took place. When real action takes place\\, it's mostly cinematic with you having to perform quick time events to keep the scene moving along. Beware\\, these buttons pop up in various areas of the screen and can be hard to see sometimes. A mess up doesn't always mean game over\\, luckily. But too many stumbles by character A\\, could lead to them not being able to rescue character B in time\\, just for an example. But if that happens\\, again\\, the game keeps moving. Shed a tear or even a smirk at that character's death and keep on trucking.\r\rThe PS4 was a great console for this to be released on. The graphics are stunning. Using facial capture\\, the characters look just like their actor counterparts and the details are insane. Pause the game when playing a character and see what I mean. You can use the R analog stick to move their faces to get a good look at the details.\r\rUntil Dawn is not a game everyone will enjoy. As a player\\, you take a backseat to most of the action which for some isn't what they look for in a game. But if you enjoy a good narrative and like to have a bit more control over said narrative\\, then this game is worth a try. Those people who enjoyed Heavy Rain a few years back and even Indigo Prophecy from a decade ago (I enjoyed both) will definitely love this game. And the horror factor\\, especially during the first play-through\\, will keep this game interesting. Since many won't be able to save every character during the first play-through\\, it can be a game that can be on constant rotation for months!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
