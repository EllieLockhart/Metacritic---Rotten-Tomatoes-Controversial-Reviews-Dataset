Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't bad\\, nor legendary. Yes\\, it packs some plot twists but it has plot holes. It was also fun but kinda boring. The Rise of Skywalker was better than this.","true":true}
