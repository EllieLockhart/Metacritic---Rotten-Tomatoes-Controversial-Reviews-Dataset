Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely mesmerizing and inspiring film. Without a doubt\\, the most beautiful\\, elegant\\, and impactful of all the Star Wars movies I've seen. Rian Johnson definitely hit it out of the ball park with this one\\, with the ball still in orbit.\\n\\nStarting with the special effects. I'm not that big a fan of CGI\\, unless their done really well. And in this movie\\, it's no exception. The way they shot the battle sequences and the space sequences including the hyper speed was amazing. I really did believe I was their in space with them. The colors in this movie were very vibrant as well as the set pieces. Namely\\, the area where Snook and his minions were stationed. The red background mixed with the black and red troops were really a feast for the eyes. It caught my attention. \\n\\nI would just like to mention that the scene where the purple-haired chick drives the cruiser into the the enemy ships by using hyper speed\\, was one of the most beautiful sequences in film history I've ever seen. The silence of it all\\, made it that much more impactful. It was mesmerizing. It's right up there with Kubrick's dongs.\\n\\nWhat can I say about this movie that's bad? Really nothing I guess. The movie is jam packed with so many things that the great movies of history have. For one\\, it has every sort of movie genre you can imagine. Action\\, Sci-fi\\, Drama\\, Romance\\, Animation\\, a bit of mystery\\, even Western and a surprising amount of great Comedy as well. I found myself laughing out loud at certain moments in the movie.\\n\\nMost importantly\\, are the messages the movie conveys. It reminds us to always have hope and to remember that good will always prevail evil\\, no matter what. No matter how hard the shit hits the fan. The movie even tackles the topic of weapons trade\\, something pretty new to the Star Wars series that I found pretty compelling to watch. Even if it was a short segment of the movie. The movie even teaches us about meditation and believing in oneself. Self projection\\, which was an amazing reveal to watch. It even shows self sacrifice for the greater good of mankind. This movie shows us a lot of important things that people\\, I hope\\, will learn from and start implementing into their lives.\\n\\nOverall\\, it was an amazing cinematic experience that I'm glad I was able to enjoy in the theaters on the big screen. It's a whole lot of fun\\, never a dull moment. But also doesn't forget to remind us of the important things in life like hope\\, trust\\, and that good will always prevail evil. Beautiful messages. This a movie I will definitely be revisiting again and again. Thank you to all the cast and staff that made such an amazing movie possible.","true":true}
