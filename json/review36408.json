Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most disappointing film of my life. I waited 40 years to see my childhood heroes back in action and the director of this film has no concept of what the Star Wars universe is about and why people loved the characters to begin with. All the characters and storylines set up in the last film  are thrown out the window. The tone\\, humor\\, pacing and logic of this film is a complete mess. They hired an  inexperienced director with little concept of storytelling and character development to direct a Star Wars film. I've never been actually depressed over a film before.","true":true}
