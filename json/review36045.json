Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi succeeds in exactly the same way the original Star Wars did: by ignoring the gimmicky\\, run-on bloodline plots\\, and getting back to a simple story about\\, ultimately\\, each of us. Few of us are special because of our bloodline\\, but we all long to be caught up in adventure\\, wielding bright power to defend the innocent and fight for the light. We all have that choice before us\\, and though not all of us will take it\\, \\\"failure is the best teacher.\\\" The Last Jedi is about the power in each of us to fight for good\\, and the hope of redemption at every turn. Brilliant\\, brilliant film. It is a most welcome entry on my list of most meaningful movies.","true":true}
