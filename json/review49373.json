Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars since the prequels. This was not a movie. It was a catastrophe. It was basically a collection of action scenes all stringed together with no purpose. Rays family origins make her seem completely uninteresting. Finn and Rose provide zero new value to the film and there mission was a complete failure consuming 30 minutes of the film. There romance was also an utter waste and not worth of our attention. Snokes background was also similarly ignored in an almost similar fashion of Ray. Snoke brags of his telepathic ability yet he can't predict Kylo rens betrayal. Lukes character closely resembled a suicidal skid row alcoholic. A complete contrast of the jedi order. Do not waste your time on this film. Rian Johnson ruined JJ Abrahams work.","true":true}
