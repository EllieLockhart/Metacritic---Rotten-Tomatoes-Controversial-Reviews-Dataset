Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not at all what I expected.  I disliked this movie.  I think I would have preferred it if the theater would have played the Star Wars Holiday show.  Yes it really was that bad!  Disney\\, you are making a lot of mistakes with this franchise.","true":true}
