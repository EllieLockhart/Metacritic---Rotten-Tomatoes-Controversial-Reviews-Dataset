Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give it a minus. This was a bloated\\, inconsistent\\, meandering mess of a story. There were moments when they teased really exciting and shocking decisions that could have taken the Star Wars universe in new directions but they then seemed to chicken out\\, taking ultimately predictable directions that just left me thinking \\\"what was the point of all of that?\\\" The second part of a trilogy is the perfect place to make those unexpected and shocking decisions.\\n\\nThis film has much bigger problems than whether it's really \\\"Star Wars\\\" or not\\, and whether it's challenging the canon or not. It's biggest problem is that it's simply boring\\, even for fans who would give anything to spend a couple more hours in this universe they love. When there are no consequences for any of the major characters\\, and there are entire sections of the film that lead nowhere\\, you can call it a subversion of the hero's journey or a comment on the nature of failure\\, but many people will simply call it a waste of a couple of hours.","true":true}
