Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems like the Star Wars fanboys are mad at the direction the Star Wars story has taken. The movie definitely passes the torch from John Lucas to new writers and directors. But elements from Lucas\u2019 vision still exist. I thought it was great.","true":true}
