His character acts out of proportion in Neil's wish to get him killed. Too few Joel scenes and most of them shows his tension with Ellie. The first guitar scene and the museum flashbacks are the only meaningful art of this game. The rest are out of proportion and twisted to fit Neil's agenda. Too many plot holes for me to cover them one by one. I did my best toJoel didn't deserve to die. His character acts out of proportion in Neil's wish to get him killed. Too few Joel scenes and most of them shows his tension with Ellie. The first guitar scene and the museum flashbacks are the only meaningful art of this game. The rest are out of proportion and twisted to fit Neil's agenda. Too many plot holes for me to cover them one by one. I did my best to review some of the most blatant plot holes in my previous comments and posts.\r\rGameplay-wise\\, it's very appealing. World building is top notch and the exploration part is painstakingly fine-tuned. Kudos to the team for creating such a commited landscapes and setting. But the story is crap\\, with a nihilistic ending leaving a hole in your chest and a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. I had to play the first game and currently am reading meaningful\\, story-centered fanfics after finishing it all just to cleanse this **** out of my system.\r\rNew infected Shambler and Point Zero Crap blows off the realistic overview of the fungal infection. Cordyceps fungi has immunosuppression properties which allows it to bypass lung defenses\\, passes into the blood stream\\, into the CSF\\, and finally to the amygala and limbic system. When the fungi infects human amygdala it stimulates aggression and overrides conscious control the body\\, reverting the evolution of a sensible human mind back into one akin of a beast.\r\rSo far\\, the four stages of infected are realistic with their behavior displaying apex predator. The Shambler and the new infected shatters the realistic background of infected firmly established by TLOU1. Such a poor decision to weave Resident Evil's monstrosity just for shock value.\r\rThe tone of this game is very grim. I'd recommend for players who are currently having a hard time with their mental health to hold off playing this for a while. I was leaked about that early scene when I was studying for a test. I didn't flunk it but I could've achieved more. Anyway\\, I made peace with it and now am looking forward to new fanfictions that'd surely overcome Neil's horrendous writing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
