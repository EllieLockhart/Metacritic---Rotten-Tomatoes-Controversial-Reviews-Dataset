Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is movie is by all means not perfect. There are story lines that are only there to give characters something to do\\, and the main story beat is not that exciting when you actually think about it. But it is visually stunning. It is funny. And it actually does something different. I love what they did with most of the characters\\, and I am excited to see where they take Episode 9.","true":true}
