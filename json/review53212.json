Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than first 2 prequels and A New Hope\\, TLJ is a fun and worthy entry into the franchise. This one's tied ranking wise for me around AFA and ROTJ. Why is it not better than those 2 movies? My belief is that Disney played this one too safe on character development with regard to Rey and Snoke. I also believe that Luke's role although very well done and welcome again\\, could have been even more meaningful. Mark Hamill does an awesome job and he does so much so that you question Disney's direction to have a Skywalker-less Star Wars sometime in the future. The direction going into the 3rd movie of this trilogy is also in question\\, as it appears the writers spent all their mojo in this movie. Those who can complain about length I can sympathize but it feels nice basking in the Star Wars universe a little longer than normal.","true":true}
