Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Captivating people for over 40 years\\, George Lucas created Star Wars as a timeless story. \\n\\nIn The Last Jedi\\, much of that story is now a series of events designed to comment on the films themselves. This underlying layer of constant self-awareness\\, with jokes and slapstick that intrude everywhere\\, joined with cameo appearances\\, quickly delivers a sense of being disposable and inauthentic.\\n\\nMuch of this busy middle chapter feels heavy-handed\\, and substandard. There are many retreads of characters and scenarios\\, often inverting the result in a desire to rapidly deconstruct Star Wars. It does not feel like we are viewing a genuine story that occurs naturally\\, but instead something over scrutinized and contrived.\\n\\nThis movie didn't seem well made. Of all the themes it addressed\\, the constant one was that Star Wars has really lost its way.","true":true}
