Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was all over the place.  Comedy scenes that did not land\\, specifically the whole \\\"Call\\\" scene at the beginning. Completely destroyed Lukes legacy while trying to clear the filed for new characters.  very disappointed!!","true":true}
