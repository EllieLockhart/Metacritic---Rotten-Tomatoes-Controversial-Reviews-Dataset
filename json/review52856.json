Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing film. Very emotional but for the right reasons. So much better than th force awakens. Can't believe it is getting a lot of hate. The action scenes were amazing and the whole story is amazing. Like the director said this is the way it had to go and I am so looking forward to seeing how they finish it off.","true":true}
