Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"horrible horrible horrible movie. i hope jj abrams somehow remake this movie and remove Rian Johnson's crap forever. \\nRian Johnson's last jedi is a midfinger to all star wars fan\\, a mid finger to JJ Abrams' force awaken\\, also a mid finger to new audiences...\\nso i went to dig his other work\\, no surprise\\,  ww chasing a fly for the entire episode\\, the only episode i don't watch again...","true":true}
