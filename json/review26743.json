Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG! First 3 minutes \\, a bell starts to ring\\, what's going on here?? a single x-wing fighter attacking an empire cruiser\\, piloted by a non-jedi?!!! WTF\\n\\nThen they randomly  slapping c3po\\, r2d2 and yoda on screen just to have a feel of classic movies. Luke Skywalker doing comedy - really?! An icon of the epic saga\\, showing milking ah err\\,  whatever creature that was-- seriously?!   \\n\\nAnd for the heck of it\\, put on \\\"cute\\\" birds-like creatures called porgs\\, who did nothing but to try to sell stuff toys. Disney butchered this movie\\, many not sure if they can recover from this.  40 years\\, molested in 2 hours. We feel so embarrassed we wanted to put our collections in a box as soon as we got home and store them under our beds.\\n\\nAnd Finn - who was a assigned in sanitation\\, without any training\\, just fought with lightsaber  with Kylo Ren in \\\"Force Awaken\\\" and now with Capt. Phasma in this movie. Really? anybody can pick up a weapon and fight with the top villains? What a Sanitation training he  must had - \\\"basic shit removal course\\\"  perhaps?.\\n\\nAn then the Rose\\, whose job was to watch the escape pods\\, tase them if needed suddenly became a pilot at par as the x-wing pilot Pal Dameron. Again\\, Disney slap an Asian actor (just like in Force Awaken)\\, because they need to penetrate the Chinese movie goers  and its one of the \\\"requirements\\\" of the Chinese govt if they want to get into China.- Again Disney making money here. So In the force awaken - we got Mexican Capt. and middle eastern cargo pilot\\, Chinese blind man and gunner\\, and of course an African-British stormtrooper defector.  And in the last Jedi\\, they have more Asian characters.  Nothing against multiculturalism\\, but don't just slap characters left and right just to please everybody in the movie house. Its a fictional film you know- there are aliens there already for crying out loud.     #RIPStarWars  \\n\\nTo most of the professional Critics in the Tomatometer - How much?","true":true}
