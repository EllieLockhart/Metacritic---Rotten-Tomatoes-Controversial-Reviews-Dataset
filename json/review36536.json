Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie feels overlong and bloated with the events not quite coming together and the character development is just not there for many of the characters . The pacing and the editing is way off .The directing feels weird sometime\\, but mostly it's beatiful. It's a really pretty film\\, it has some of the most beautiful and striking moments in any Star Wars film.\\n\\nI don't think the director cared that much about making a Star Wars film\\, he cared much more about \\\"deconstructing\\\" Star Wars film\\, where the traditional Star Wars elements are downplayed and he introduces a lot of his personal politics to the world..\\n\\nA much beloved character is really humiliated and not done justice at all\\, I can't really enjoy the movie after that.","true":true}
