Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once Poe started his stand up routine with Hux I developed a knot in my stomach that didn't leave until the movie was over...hence this review.\\n\\nKelly Marie Tran over Ng\u00f4 Thanh for lead....extremely poor decision.\\n\\nClose up of \\\"blue eyed\\\" Captain Phasma had my kids asking \\\"why did they have to  show the eye and why did it have to be blue like ours?\\\"\\, well kids get used to it. \\n \\nDisney is in it for the money\\, nothing more nothing less...this movie alone will generate 20 new Halloween costumes alone...RIP SW  \\n\\n(funny side note: the family wondered if i felt okay after movie\\, i had to use bathroom 4 times this movie was unwatchable)","true":true}
