Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was pumped for this movie ! I love being sucked into movie and being taken away by it. About 5-6 times during this movie I was throw off by bad writing and just over all disappointment. I left the movie with no emotions about it\\, but left asking friends what did you like about this movie. It tired to hard to well rounded and lost its goal of great film Also I felt the music was not on level for the film .","true":true}
