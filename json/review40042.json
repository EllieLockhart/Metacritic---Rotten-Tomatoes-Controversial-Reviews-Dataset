{"101487":182243,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first movie review I have ever written\\, and probably my only one because I'm on winter break of my senior year in college\\, majoring in Electrical engineering. And\\, since I'm a poor college student\\, I don't waste money on stupid movies and I use Rotten Tomatoes to identify the good movies and it has been accurate. However\\, I really thought the %74 critics review on the newest Ghostbusters was just abnormality...but I was wrong.\\n\tRotten tomatoes critics sadly grade on a curve\\, however the curve is usually +10 to 13 extra points on a good movie (ex. \\\"Logan\\\"\\, and \\\"Mad Max fury road\\\". These two movies have both a high critics and audience score with is completely accurate. On the other hand\\, certain movies that aggressively agree with their political beliefs get a bigger boost. For example\\, the all-female Ghostbusters which was terrible. Sadly\\, the last Jedi is not like mad max fury road but more like Ghostbusters. The story seems as if its written just to force a pollical agenda then actually tell a logical and enjoyable movie. For instance\\, lots of white woman and minorities on the resistance\\, and pretty much all white men and Captain Phasma on the bad side. This is not a coincidence\\, this was planned out by the creators of the last Jedi\\, and they got caught because they unintentionally created a terrible movie by focusing on nonsense. I am from Los Angles and I see a lot of actor\/actresses that never succeed\\, and not giving minorities parts on the bad guys side because some white liberal woman wants to create an \\\"us vs them\\\" mentality is going to destroy many opportunities for minority actors to succeed (oh by the way there is a five second scene where ONE African American woman gets into an x-wing that the director wanted the audience to see). And by the way\\, I'm Mexican! Not some white trash alt right guy\\, and I am smart enough to know this movie is political garbage.\\n\tNow about the movie... it is boring! The prequals were not the best but they still expanded the story George Lucas wanted to tell\\, and that Star Wars story was interesting. The Last Jedi feels like I'm watching hunger games( Disney's goal?). Disney spent two years teasing Luke Skywalker return and it was literally destroyed in the first scene when Luke throws his lightsaber over his shoulder and over a cliff. The most powerful Jedi that saved Darth Vader from the dark side and saved the galaxy is now portrayed as angry white man because Disney wants us to know that a woman can come save the world too.  IF you want to hate on the fanboys\\, how about you hate on dishonesty! They teased Luke to get us to watch it\\, then destroyed his character so people with this PC garbage can like it! Luke Skywalker is Star War! George Lucas said Star Wars was always a family story\\, and I like many others watched the force awakens and the last Jedi to see Luke Skywalker. Honestly\\, if the movie would have dedicated 10 mins to Luke Skywalker being an ACTUAL JEDI with a real fight the movie's revenue probably would increase by $200\\,000\\,000. \\nNow about the movie:\\n\tThe whole Finn and Rose story looked like it was copied from Final Fantasy 7 when they go to the casino in the game and race fucken chocbos. \\n\tThe first order can chase people in light speed? Oh\\, ya he must have talked to JJ Abrams because they do the same thing in \\\"Star Trek into darkness\\\".\\n\tThe whole Princess Leia portrayal is stupid. It would have made more sense that she became a Jedi and not a General\\, but since TFA was trying to be inclusive I thought it was ok. However\\, once I saw TLJ\\, Leia was ridiculous. She should of just became a Jedi later in life! But wait then they wouldn't be able to shove Rey into our face right?\\n\tThe scene where STRONG WOMAN tells Poe that he is hot headed? Oh but then they need the white women to say\\, \\\"but we like him\\\"? That's a fucken slap in my face. The one Hispanic actor needs to two white woman to tell him stop acting like a man\\, but want him to still support their cause. Fucken pollical  bullshit.\\n\tYoda is a puppet again ??? I spent my whole childhood seeing both a puppet and CGI Yoda !!! WTF man! And he trained Jedi for a 1000 years\\, but Rey already knows everything\\, so he burned those Jedi relics? Wtf!\\n\tThe ending scene when the orphan stable boy it looking out into space while the force theme music is playing is stupid. It is obvious they are trying to state that anyone can be a Jedi. But Darth Vader was born a slave with a single mother raising him then everyone he loves dies so it was already established that anyone could be a Jedi!\\nMany of these scenes are such PC garbage that they stand out...and literally force anyone that has the metal ability to use a cell phone to scratch their head and wonder if they are watching a movie or is Disney trying to get people to vote for the democratic party. When these scenes happen the movie practically stops because the timing is off.\\n\tThis is not the most intellectual Star Wars movie ever made\\, and people that think that probably thought majoring in political science at collecting $100\\,000 of student debt was a good idea! Its different\\, and not what anyone expected but in a stupid way\\, and not in a smart way. The new force powers are dumb. Rey and shirtless Kylo can communicate via FORCE FACETIME. The bombing scene in the beginning attempting to make the audience have an emotional connection to Rose's sister because she is sacrificing herself. Wtf! Its like a scene out of that other terrible PEARL HARBOR! Or wait the bombs FALL on the enemy ship!!! Gravity exists in space???? Hold on... this is too smart for me\\, let me take a break from studying Maxwell's equations to understand the intellectual mind benders of this movie!!\\n\tFinns character was enjoyable in the force awakens\\, but in this movie\\, he is second fiddle to Rose. They go find the code breaker aka Benicio Del Toro (yes\\, he is an Hispanic too\\, but not the special resistance one like Poe that they want Hispanics to identify with). This whole sequence seems out of place.  Then they go free the chocobos\\, and Rose has a magic ring that shows the orphans that she is part of the resistance...yawn.\\n\tI really don't understand why do this to a beloved franchise. Star Wars isn't just movies\\, its toy light saber fights\\, video games\\, Disneyland\\, and books\/comics! Oh\\, Star Wars battle front 2 just came out and they put all the main White MALE characters (plus Lando\\, and of course REY...yawn) in it because they want WHITE MEN to play the video game!  \\n\tStar Tours was also my favorite ride at Disneyland and I get teary eyed looking at a picture of my Father and I outside the ride gift shop because of how Disney destroyed Star Wars for me. Even if you didn't like the prequels you were at least safe still watching the original trilogy\\, but since this movie brings back Luke Skywalker I can't watch the original trilogy anymore because of what they turned Luke into.\\n\tIf anyone was inspired by Star Wars as a kid and grew up to be an Electrical Engineer\\, I hope you never work for Disney's Imagineering and help them create a GOOD Star Wars land and rides for what they have done to Star Wars. Let theme hire a bunch of political correct liberal arts people to build it. Then again\\, they will probably outsource all major engineering work to India because they care so much about Americans (all races and sexes will be affected).\\nOh and I also used Logan and Mad Max fury road as examples because they are also progressive movies and to prove I'm not biased\\, but they are well done stories that make sense and are interesting. On the other hand\\, Ghostbusters was terrible with PC garbage and so is TLJ.\\nNow I'm paying close attention to the Marvel cinematic universe...and I can start to sense that black widow is going to become more important than she is...and no minorities will ever be villains. But I already sold my Disney stock to pay for my engineering books...\\nPS: If you choose Rey in Battlefront 2 you automatically win the game with no explanation","true":true}
