Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Everyone was expecting a light hearted game filled with moments of Ellie's and Joel's interactions.

In a world like this\\, it would be highly unrealistic. This game carries mature and heavy themes\\, so it is understandable why it wasn't made for everyone. For those pressed about what happens in the beginning that sets the plot for the rest of the game- how else would you have told this story? Naughty Dog acknowledges the brutality of killing off this loved character\\, and wants the audience to feel just like Ellie- someone who just lost their father. Others are mad at the \\\"poor writing\\\"\\, but the four complex timelines the game carries is highly difficult and ballsy to pull off. Having to \\\"walk a mile\\\" for the character you truly hate has the purpose to really test the player's bias and morals. The ending did trigger many people- a plot of revenge doesn't end in revenge. But what about the first game? The plot of \\\"saving humanity\\\" didn't end in that. Plot and stories are different. Plot: finding the cure of humanity\\, story: relationship between Ellie and Joel. Plot: revenge\\, story: grief and forgiveness. If you walk away still wanting Abby dead\\, you may have completed the game but not with your soul. Yes this game is emotionally draining\\, but it reflects the sad truth about our reality- how unstructured and animal-like society would become in a world like this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
