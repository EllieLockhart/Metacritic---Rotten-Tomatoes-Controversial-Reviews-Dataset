{"101487":159089,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, let's get something straight. We now live in a time where companies now pay for positive social media reviews for their movies. If you are reading this\\, you are reading a review from a REAL profile. \\n\\nThat being said\\, I am a die hard Star Wars fan. Disney fucked this one so royally that there is no going back. Star Wars isn't dead\\, but Disney has soiled it's existence with cheap gimmicks and atrocious writing. \\n\\nThe story is extremely uninteresting. The character development was WORSE than TFA\\, and that's saying something. The characters were plastic and felt like they were written in a DNC think tank. Admiral Holdo (hildo)\\, I firmly believe\\, was forced into the story under the order of Hillary Clinton. Seriously\\, her campaign manager probably had some story input. Knowing how Disney directly colluded with her campaign\\, this is very possible. It was THAT bad.\\n\\nSeriously\\, this was there mindset when writing this movie. \\n1. Make a memorable cuddly alien to market the shit out of and give it an inordinate amount of screen time (they gave more screentime to porgs than r2. Fuck you movie)\\n2. Include as many women as possible and make men look dumb. (Seriously\\, I'm all for women making their mark on society\\, but this was just blatant man hating sexism. Sorry\\, just because you are a women doesn't mean you are granted infinite wisdom).\\n3. Rip off as many elements from the Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi\\, because JUST ripping off a new hope isn't as efficient as ripping off TWO movies!\\n4. Throw the occasional shot of Chewie and R2 just to make the fans happy (fuck you\\, movie).\\n5. We need to make Leia use the force to make fans happy (they bullshat their way through that one and made Admiral Ackbar go out like a bitch. Fuck you movie)\\n6. Include a character to represent Hillary Clinton\\, because we\\, the writers are delusionally \\\"still with her\\\" (Holdo. One vowel away from Hildo. Attacked by the dirty man because all men are wrong. And she 'sacrificed' herself for the \\\"resistance\\\". You could cut the similarities with a fucking knife).\\n7. Throw a casino scene in there\\, because who doesn't want a casino scene? (I'll tell you who: fans of good films\\, structure\\, and writing. That's who!)\\n8. Make sure to include an unnecessary Asian character because studies show we make more money in China with asian characters in the film (that character left a taste of vomit and corpse in my mouth. Yuck!!!). \\n9. Since Mark Hammill has been vocally critical of the movie\\, just go ahead and kill his character off so Disney doesn't have to deal with him anymore. I'm sure audiences won't care about losing the main protagonist of the series. They care WAY too much for our hollow SJW characters to care about Luke Skywalker (fucking WRONG!!!!!!!!!).   \\n10. Oh\\, I guess we should write a story surrounding this thing. Oh who cares about story? It's star wars. It'll make money. Fuck the story\\, fuck the character arc\\, and fuck everything George Lucas created. People LOVE our new star wars!!! I mean\\, look at all these wonderful reviews that critics are writing (critics that Disney paid off\\, keep in mind).\\n\\nThis story ignores everything about what made Star Wars memorable for fans. Star Wars is about fighting the monolithic\\, faceless power that threatens to destroy us all. Unfortunately\\, that faceless evil power now OWNS star wars. And they destroyed it all in favor of their shareholders. This is NOT star wars. This is a shitty Pirates of the Caribbean movie in space. \\n\\nDon't go see it. Choke the Disney Star Wars franchise off from your money. And hopefully\\, we can kill Disney's efforts before they chloroform the franchise\\, take it down to the basement\\, and\\, well... you've seen what they've done to this thing... \\n\\nKathleen Kennedy? Fuck you for making this thing with \\\"studies\\\" and not \\\"story\\\". \\nGeorge Lucas? All is forgiven from the poorly executed prequels. They at least had direction (story was good\\, acting and writing were awful).\\nJJ\\, excuse me\\, Jar Jar Abrams? You might as well get away from Ep 9 while you can before you go down with the ship that you steered into the iceberg.\\nRion Johnson? You suck. I know Disney fucked you\\, but you should have had the decency to walk away from such a dumpster fire. \\nMark Hammil? Thank you for being real about the franchise. Everything you said about Disney was right. \\nOscar Issac? I know this is easier said than done\\, but you should walk away from the franchise. I know Disney owns everything now\\, but it'll give you major street cred. You don't need Star Wars. \\nDisney? You are the evil film Empire\\, and you must be destroyed with a trust busting photon torpedo down your thermal exhaust port. \\n\\nMay the force by with you.","true":true}
