Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Misplaced humor\\, deus ex machina\\, wonky plot\\, no saber duels\\, and stupid use of Luke to prop up Disney's heroine. So much for the Skywalker legacy. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. What on Earth was that Rose subplot? Why do we still have ZERO answers about Snoke? Why is Phasma STILL useless and just a shiny trooper? \\n\\nIf you want some eye-candy and are new to the franchise - it's an amazing movie. If you value some sense of continuity or respect for characters \/ EU ... it's not even a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
