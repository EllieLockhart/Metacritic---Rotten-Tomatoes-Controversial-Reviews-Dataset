Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow I never thought that a Star Wars movie would be this bad. Even the first five minutes feel like it's a bad joke... some kind of parody. Disney ruined it! I was a big Star Wars fan for decades. Very sad.","true":true}
