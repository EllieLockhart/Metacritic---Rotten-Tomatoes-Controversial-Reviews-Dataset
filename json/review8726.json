Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a film that has many of the flashiest scenes in Star Wars it it's most disappointing how Disney has treated this newly acquired property.  The is not due to bad acting.  The actors and actresses did there job to the tee.  It's storytelling leads to dead ends.  Bad editing.  You feel like they do not care about Star Wars lore and just about making money.  They want to kill any involvement with George Lucas and his story.  Somehow Rey evidenely needs no training whatsoever.  Questions we wanted answered in this movie not only are they never answered but the questions themselves are trashed.  I don't know how they will fix\\nthis in Episode 9.  I can only stomach seeing this movie once.  I'm not buying the Blue-Ray.","true":true}
