Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney ruined Star Wars should be the headline. The story is based on nothing (think about what the missions and outcomes were)\\, characters don\u2019t haven chemistry and are forced to kiss. The exciting Jedi training is cut out. My childhood idol\\, Luke Skywalker\\, is washed up and can\u2019t act the way Disney is pushing his character. He is made into being the sole comic relief scene for each segment . Admiral Holdo\u2019s purple hair reminds me of the 80\u2019s and Hunger Games. No emotional attachment to the Series anymore. The complex technology seems to get worse with time. The complexity of the planets\\, character interactions and theme are dumbed down like an \u201cAddress the People\u201d statement done by George W. Bush. Great movie for the 6-14 year old but everyone else loses out. ","true":true}
