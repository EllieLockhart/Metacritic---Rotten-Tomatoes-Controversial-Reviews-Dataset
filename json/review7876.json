Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excessive length and the one-joke-too-many syndrome are the only drawbacks to this fantastic and mind-blowing movie. I'm glad that after 40 years\\, Star Wars can still surprise me\\, and in a good way!","true":true}
