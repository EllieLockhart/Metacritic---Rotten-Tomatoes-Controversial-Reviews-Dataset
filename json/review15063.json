Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the movie depressed\\, I\u2019m still depressed two days later. This film lessens the significance of the original trilogy and the original characters. This film goes from amazing\\, to boring\\, back to amazing and then soul crushing. I can\u2019t believe one film in one moment could destroy a passion and a love I\u2019ve had since the 70\u2019s. I wish the Skywalker saga just end with Return of the Jedi. No prequels or sequels\\, just the joy of the original Star Wars films. ","true":true}
