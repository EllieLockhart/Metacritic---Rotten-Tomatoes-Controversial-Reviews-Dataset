Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent continuation of the Star Wars legacy.  I've been a fan since the original in 1977.  The Last Jedi is probably the most challenging (and perhaps rewarding) film in the series in that it challenges some of the tropes that have made the Star Wars universe somewhat predictable.  At the same time Director Rian Johnson adheres to the central themes that made the movies exciting and inspirational in the first place.","true":true}
