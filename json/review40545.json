Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst and most stupid Star Wars movie it has a stupid subplot where 3 of the characters with a dumb plan get 95% of the fleeing Resistance killed\\,  Snoke has a massive magnifying glass so he can see the Resistance ships escape from the Raddus capital ship which should be called the radish as it's got all the firepower of a root vegetable. Mark Hamill is superb and there was little of loved characters like Chewbacca and R2D2. The Last Jedi makes The Phantom Menace look like The Empire Strikes Back I am a Very Disappointed EX STAR WARS FAN.","true":true}
