Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've enjoyed every Star Wars movie\\, even ones that were considered not so great (prequels). Likewise\\, I enjoyed this movie...I think? I'm still weighing it out. Overall it just never really 'kicked-in' for me. Felt like it was building towards some amazing crescendo\\, but it never delivered. Kylo Ren is so wishy-washy and it's really getting to a point where it's like\\, dude\\, just pick a side already! The effects are awesome. The music is amazing. I love seeing some familiar characters.  But it just fell flat for me. And the humor was a bit too much in this episode. It was overused and not necessary. In fact it took away from certain scenes because it was used. I have no real desire to see this one again. And that's rare for a Star Wars movie. Hoping for better next time\\, but I still love Star Wars!","true":true}
