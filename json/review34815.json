Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The dynamic of Kylo Ren and Rey is amazing and a new story to Star Wars. I found Rose and Finn's storyline boring and it dragged on though I did appreciate Finn's character development by the end. The fight scene in the throne room is a huge highlight.  I found it visually stunning  as well.","true":true}
