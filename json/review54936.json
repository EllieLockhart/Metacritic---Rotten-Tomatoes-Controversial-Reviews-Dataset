Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really sad what they did to the franchise with this installment. Luke is a sad old quitter. The Empire is now run by sniveling idiots. The big bad guy was easily snuffed out by a Darth Vader cosplayer. the new leader of the resistance got there by disobeying orders and getting 99% of the resistance killed in by scheming against resistance leadership. Wealth envy played a big role. In SW... WEALTH ENVY. Give me a break. \\nEye-rolling moments: Benicio has a stutter that makes no sense. Finn was going FULL THROTTLE at the laser battering ram and yet Rose was able to turn around and get ahead of him enough to drive him out of the way? Animals with hoofs climbed a cliff face. Alien redneck at a casino. After accelerating at the laser-ram for 20 minutes of screen time\\, Finn walks back to base dragging rose within 2 minutes. Anything with Poe. Anything with Hux.
