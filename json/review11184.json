Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly can't see why fanboys are hating this so much\\, except that it's asking them to embrace change.\\n\\nThere were several aspect of the film that grated with me\\, not least that General Hux has literally been reduced to the role of evil comic side kick\\, however I thought his character was somewhat ridiculous in the first film.\\n\\nWithout giving away spoilers - there are several plot lines from the first of this series that effectively amount to dead ends\\, however\\, again- if you embrace the change it's easy to see that this can take the Star wars universe in a new direction.\\n\\nUltimately I felt this was a bold movie\\, with some glaring flaws\\, but one which rolled the dice and decided to take a chance on expanding the Star Wars canon\\, and this should be applauded.","true":true}
