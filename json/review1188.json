Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A permanently entertaining film but at some times feeling too long. A continuation on a growing universe but with characters that do not look developing much. Some questionable additions to the universe's possibilities as well as some particular scenes and situations feel superfluous and unnecessary. Being a fan of the saga\\, I do not feel an authentic desire of going to see it again.","true":true}
