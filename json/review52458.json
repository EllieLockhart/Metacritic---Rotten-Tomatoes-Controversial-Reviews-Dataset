Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great Star Wars film. While the plot with Rose and Finn may be lacking in execution to me it's just forgettable. Not bad\\, but forgettable. Which is fine when the rest of the movie is so good. Rey and Luke have great plots\\, Kylo Ren is still just as complex (if not more) in this film then the last\\, and I personally don't have any problems with the Po plot. I can see why Star Wars fans were mad. It's a different film. It's more about loss and struggle than the others. But personally\\, I was not disappointed. Well done everyone at Disney and Lucasfilm who worked on this film.","true":true}
