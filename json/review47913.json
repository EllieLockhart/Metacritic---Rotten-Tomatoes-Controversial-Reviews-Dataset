Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I can see why some fans of the Star Wars universe might not like The Last Jedi in my estimation this was one of the better films to come out after the original trilogy. Not only did it delve deeper into the story that seems to be unfolding between Kylo Ren and Rey but it keeps you guessing through the entire film. No derivative plot points here. Without spoiling this film I can safely say\\, \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think.\\\"","true":true}
