Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay guys - give it a while to settle in your brain. If I'd done this review fresh out the movie theater it probably would be a 2.5\\, maybe 3. On reflection\\, dealing with the story arcs and sorting the wheat from the chaff\\, it's a solid 5\/5! Thanks Rian!","true":true}
