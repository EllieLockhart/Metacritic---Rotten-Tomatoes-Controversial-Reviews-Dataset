Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed TFA despite its derivative storyline\\, and loved Rogue One\\, so I guess I was coming in with pretty high expectations. I have no beef with the Luke Skywalker storyline (which many fans have complained about)\\, the acting was fine and there were some awesome set pieces and a few surprises. That said\\, there is a difference between exposition (bad) and story (good). The prequel trilogy was exposition heavy (and dreadful on most levels)\\, but TLJ barrels along moment to moment with very little connection to what has come before in the Star Wars Universe. And honestly\\, it does not inspire much confidence that the filmmaker knows where it's going in the next chapter either. With sequels like Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049 out there\\, it's really not surprising that SW fans are really not that happy with TLJ. I'm still wondering why so many critics lauded it so heavily.","true":true}
