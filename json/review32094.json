Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**SPOILERS**\\nThough this movie is desperately trying to freshen up the franshise\\, it fails in basics such as continuing the descent and established storyline and living up to fans expectations: when the fan-theories are more exciting than the plot itself than the screenwriters are bad at their job. \\nCopying the lines from the ROTJ and being afraid to kill of the characters (Finn\/Leia) and killing those who could make the story more interesting (Snoke\\, Luke) is a very ill decision. \\nAnd not to forget...PLOT HOLES! \\nAs a long time fan I am deeply saddened and disappointed.","true":true}
