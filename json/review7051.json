Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Effects were great\\, story not so much. Disney is ruining Star Wars so I won't be suckered into spending my money on movie tickets anymore and will just wait until it's on television. Thanks for nothing Disney.","true":true}
