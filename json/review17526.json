Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed into RT and made an account just so I can express how much I hated this film. By far the worse Star Wars film ever. I would rather get water boarded in Guantanamo Bay than watch this movie again. Putrid garbage. Horrible story\\, terrible character development. Biggest cinema disappointment in years for me.","true":true}
