Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"while struggling to flesh out the new characters and give enough screen time to the old characters\\, the movie becomes too long\\, and has too many endings.Enough so that it probably would have been better as 2 movies. The art direction is excellent\\, with the exception of the costume design which I thought was really terrible. The movies not bad\\, but it could have been better.","true":true}
