Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this film took a lot of risks\\, and only about half of them paid off. It is funnier than previous films in the franchise\\, but sometimes that humor seems out of place. Many of the tensions built up in Episode VII were left unexplored here because the characters were otherwise occupied\\, and too busy forming relationships with new characters to continue developing those from TFA.  On the other hand\\, the relationships from the last film that were further developed led to emotional payoffs and character development. It was flawed\\, but enjoyable\\, and leaves the Star Wars Galaxy in a different place with interesting questions to (hopefully) be answered by subsequent films.","true":true}
