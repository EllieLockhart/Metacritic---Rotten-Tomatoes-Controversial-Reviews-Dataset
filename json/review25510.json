Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(No spoilers here)\\n\\n3.5\/5 stars\\n\\nThis was really the tale of two halves to the movie.  In the first half of the movie I was really pretty irked.  (Not Phantom Menace irked\\, but still irked).  It just felt like there was no depth and the plot was going all over the place and it was trying to be too cute and silly (think Ewoks or Jar Jar) and was really just annoying me.\\n\\nThen the second half turned into a REALLY good movie.  Not just the classic Star Wars battle scenes but the plots and the characters. And they still had humor\\, but it felt well timed and appropriate\\, not just distracting.\\n\\nI really wish they would have streamlined the movie.  The ENTIRE plot line with Benicio Del Toro was completely unneeded.   The movie was 2 1\/2 hours long and felt it.  They probably could have cut 30-45 minutes and had a REALLY strong movie.\\n\\nSpeaking of Benicio\\, I really didn't like him and Laura Dern in the movie.  I wish they would have gone with non-stars (like they do with Rey and Finn and Poe). It felt distracting to the movie.","true":true}
