Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is a U-turn disbark from every plotline the force awakens had set in place\\, Did you have questions and theories from the previous film? None of them will be answered or confirmed\\, are you a fan of all the lore and exposition of all the previous star wars films? Unfortunately you will find none here. This film spit in the face of  4 generations of my family\\, and has made me move attack of the clones up a spot from the worst star wars movie ever made.","true":true}
