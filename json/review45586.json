Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing\\, not only did it do a complete 180 from the original saga films\\, but even from the previous installment\\, J.J Abrams \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". Between the poor and forced (no pun intended) use of childish\\, out-of-universe comedy (Ala Marvel films)\\, lore breaking depictions of characters and events (flying Leia\\, evil and cowardly Luke Skywalker\\, hyper space ram that negates all major Star Wars space battles prior) it was an incredibly arrogant deconstruction of the star wars mythos\\, and was frankly an insult not only the fans\\, but to Star Wars\\, George Lucas\\, and Mark Hamill. I will never watch another film directed by Rian Johnson\\, despite really enjoying \\\"Looper\\\"\\, and being excited for \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" when hearing he was directing... Wow how my expectations were shattered\\, for the sake of \\\"subverting expectations\\\". \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" - Congratulations Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy\\, you actually did it! Star Wars may never recover from this\\, you have lost the adoration and trust of over 50% of the die-hard Star Wars fans of all ages\\, as clear to see in the audience score here\\, the \\\"Solo\\\" box office numbers\\, and the DVD\/Blu-Ray sales for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
