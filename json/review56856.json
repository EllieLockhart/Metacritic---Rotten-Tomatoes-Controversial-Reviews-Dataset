Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a single word that comes to mind when I think of Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, \\\"WHY?\\\" and if I ever had the chance to meet the director Rian Johnson this is the question I would ask him.  Visually there are some amazing scenes\\, but the story I just don't get.  I want to understand why he made the film that he did and what's the story he trying to tell.\\n\\nIt's been a few days since I saw The Last Jedi and I've had this uncomfortable feeling which I haven't been able to understand. Today I finally figured it out\\, the Last Jedi has done something to me which I didn't think possible\\, it's made me not care. I really don't care about what comes next for Finn\\, Rey\\, Poe etc. and it makes me sad.  Perhaps before making another movie \\\"the powers that be\\\" should ask themselves \\\"why.\\\" The magic of Star Wars and Disney has always been in taking us on a journey and that's where this film disappoints.  At least I still have Episodes 1-6.","true":true}
