Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't just bad\\, it was insulting.  Who goes to a science fiction fantasy film to have left-wing SJW politics rammed down your throat?  It was a huge slap in the face to anyone who grew up with Star Wars.  Leaving aside the heavy-handed politics\\, the new characters have no charisma whatsoever.  Couldn't care a less whether any of them lived or died.  Now that the original characters have been either ignominiously killed off or passed away in real life\\, and all the plot set-ups from the TFA trashed or ruined\\, what's left to see in Episode IX?  Frankly\\, I hope they cancel it.  I have no interest in seeing another Social Justice Wars.","true":true}
