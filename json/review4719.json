Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely breaks from anything remotely close to the saga until this point. Disjointed from even the previous movie. Honestly this felt more like someone making fun of Star Wars and it's fans than being interested in adding to the decades spanning story.\\n\\nI had seen every single Star Wars film in the theatre on opening week up to this one. It was and will be the last I spend money on. ","true":true}
