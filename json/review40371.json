Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is really\\, really bad.  Where do I begin?\\n1. The Last Jedi ignored the previous movie. Why was there a map to Luke when Luke didn't want to be found?\\n2. You always need to suspend disbelief to enjoy Star Wars\\, but many things that happened in The Last Jedi were just plain ridiculous. For example\\, Leia's \\\"Mary Poppins in Space\\\" moment was the most ridiculous scene in cinematic history.\\n3. There was too much disrespect for Star Wars tradition and for Star Wars fans..\\n4. The characters were pointless. Rose did nothing. Phasma was given minimal attention. Poe accomplished nothing. Chewbacca did nothing except nearly eat a porg\\, which was disgusting and hypocritical: he threw it away\\, and thus killed it for no reason. Is that supposed to be funny?\\n5. The problem of Vice Admiral Holdo. How did Poe not know who she was? There were only a few hundred rebels\\, and she has purple hair\\, but Poe doesn't know who she is? Really??? Also\\, there was no purpose for not telling Poe the plan.\\n6. Rey is too powerful; she has no training. She is too idealized.\\n7. Storyline has no clear direction; nothing is accomplished and it goes nowhere.\\n9. They weaponized light speed.  If it was that simple\\, then why didn't someone do this before?\\n10. Luke's astral projection across the galaxy: if this was possible for a Jedi to do\\, then why didn't Obi-Wan and Yoda do it in Episodes 1-3?","true":true}
