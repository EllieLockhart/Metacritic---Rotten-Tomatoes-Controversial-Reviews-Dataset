Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film of the series.  (I'll try not to spoil the BIG moments in the film\\, but there are some spoilers ahead)  The story and plotting were fresh and creative (unlike the completely unoriginal and derivative The Force Awakens). However\\, Rian Johnson went too far and as a result\\, it doesn't fit in the Star Wars universe that George Lucas created. \\n\\nThe best thing about the movie were the usual \\\"window dressings\\\" that come with a Star Wars film: The spectacle\\, John Williams' score\\, the special effects and CGI\\, the sound effects\\, the acting\\, etc. \\n\\nHowever\\, as good as those are\\, the plotting and storyline are equally bad.\\n\\nThe heroic Luke Skywalker is the polar opposite of the Luke we knew in ROTJ.  He went from a brave\\, hopeful hero\\, to a jaded\\, bitter old coward hiding and hoping for death to take him.  I agree with Mark Hamill's initial skepticism. \\\"I too fundamentally disagree with EVERY decision Rian Johnson made for Luke). This isn't Luke Skywalker. This is like a bad Star Trek episode\\, where we meet the alternate universe version of the character.\\n\\nThe relationship between Rose and Finn is fun and one of the better parts of the film. Kelly Marie Tran is a breath of fresh air. That said\\, they literally have no effect on the outcome of the story. Literally. Take them out of the movie and it ends exactly the same way. The only difference is that a very shiny\\, overly-hyped\\, overrated\\, glorified storm trooper would have survived. That said\\, Phasma's character was completely pointless (aside from looking cool) and was easily replaceable by just another stormtrooper. This was a shame\\, because Gwendoline Christie is a phenomenally talented actor and was sorely underused.\\n\\nLeia was handled well. UNTIL she does something so utterly and completely ridiculous\\, it takes you right out of the film.  This is so unbelievable (Even in the Star Wars universe) that it's hard to get back into it after that. \\n\\nPoe has his moments\\, but again...just like Finn and Rose\\, he has no real effect on the outcome. He just spends his time causing more trouble than helping. In fact\\, his repeated bad decisions effect the outcome negatively and his choices actually make the First Order's job that much easier.\\n\\nAnd Rey. Wow. She spends most of the movie begging look to train her. He eventually agrees to trains her. She takes all this knowledge and doesn't use ANY of her training.  She essentially is just a pawn being used by both Snoke and Kylo Ren and also has VERY LITTLE effect on the outcome except for moving a pile of rocks.\\n\\nWhile Adam Driver delivers a fantastic performance\\, Ren\\, the relationship between Ren and Rey is a disaster. Think the movie \\\"Ghost\\\" minus the romance and clay pot. \\n\\nSnoke\\, Hux \\, Phasma and the First order all seem completely incompetent and inept.\\n\\nThe finale is anti-climactic. Rian Johnson goes so far out of the box that it feels forced. It was like he tried to be different JUST for the sake of being different. \\n\\nOverall\\, Rian Johnson used too much comedy.  It was overused. And often times\\, when there was a moment of gravity or seriousness\\, the comedy undercut it. IT was as if Johnson couldn't help himself.\\n\\nI typically see Star Wars movies 3 times or more in the theater. I was so disappointed by this movie that 1 time was enough. In actuality\\, I honestly wish I'd never watch it in the first place. It was THAT bad.","true":true}
