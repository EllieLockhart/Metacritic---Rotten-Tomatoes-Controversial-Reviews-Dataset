{"101487":129427,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a Star Wars fan\\, but moreover I am a fan of good cinema; whether it's the poetic beauty of Andrei Tarkovsky or the popcorn entertainment mastery of Steven Spielberg\\, a good movie is a good movie. Further more I love Rian Johnson's films; particularly Brick\\, but The Brothers Bloom and Looper are interesting films with their own merits. When it was announced he would direct this film I thought he was exactly the man for the job.\\n\\nBefore I see a film I don't inundate myself with trailers\\, news and fan theories. Not because I don't want anything spoiled\\, just because it's completely irrelevant until the film comes out. It actually drives me nuts that people freak out about these Star Wars trailers because they never include anything about the story. And everything surrounding them until release day is empty speculation that only serves to have fans' personal identities inexorably wrapped up in the film.\\n\\nI say all this because I entered this film with level expectations thinking \\\"Episode VII was an adequate entertainment\\, but now it's time for this new trilogy to take off and I'm interested to see where it goes.\\\"\\n\\nSPOILERS\\n\\nTwenty minutes into this movie I was horribly bored; we are introduced and re-introduced to too many characters at the beginning and throughout the film. It bogs down the story and all these characters seem to need a big moment to justify their presence in this movie and the last one (Finn?... PHASMA!?!) No one seems to be the clear hero or villain. There are enormous amounts of exposition that barely get you to the next scene before even more exposition. There is no lasting tension or excitment in the story; the plot is meandering\\, incoherent and full of inconsequential events that are defused in the same scene. Any dialogue that isn't on the nose exposition is heavy handed\\, hamfisted\\, flimsy characterization or cringey\\, out of character attempts at humour.\\n\\nAmong the worst parts of the movie is anything to do with Rey and Luke in... Ireland. First of all\\, the scenes are just terribly repetitive; when Rey insists Luke help the Resistance\\, she uses the same plea THREE times\\, almost verbatim (\\\"the resistance needs you... Kylo Ren is getting stronger and is going to take over the galaxy... you're Luke Skywalker...\\\") Rey's training offers no insights to her character and feels glossed over. This next one is what I suspect people feel is \\\"taking Star Wars in a new direction\\\"\\, but I hate it; Rey and Kylo can use the force to talk to each other (okay fine\\, that was in previous Star Wars) while also being able to SEE one another... WHAT? That's weird... But not weirder than the fact that they can... Astral Project? Or something? Like Kylo has a conversation with Rey from his ship while it's raining in... Ireland... And looks down to find rain droplets on his hand... This strikes me as a lazy screenwriting device and it's used again to even worse effect at the end of the movie. I've never rolled my eyes so much\\, I'm lucky they didn't fly right out of my skull.\\n\\nWorse than that is a bunch of plot holes and laughable occurrences; Leia knows how to force fly through space? More impressive\\, she knows how not to burn up in a fiery explosion. Space ships can run out of fuel? This has never come up ever before\\, seems like a convenience for the plot. The Resistance tires to sneak off their big ship because the First Order won't see them on radar... But they have huge windows on their bridge... Won't they notice a line of about a dozen or more transport ships leaving your cruiser? I mean\\, they saw them at the beginning of the movie when your were evacuating.\\n\\nOverall a big problem is that it's almost as much of a remake of Empire as Force Awakens is of New Hope. It's thinly disguised by inverting where the imagery occurs in the story and adding a dash of Return of the Jedi. What am I talking about? Well\\, the ship at the end of Empire is the same ship the Resistance escape from their secret base on. There's a visual similarity between Dagobah and... Ireland... Both being lush and green where the Jedi-In-Training has a dark encounter with a cloaked version of themselves; X-wing underwater; Yoda. The dash of Jedi is the scenes with Rey\\, Kylo and Snoke; they are carbon copies of the RotJ scenes with Luke\\, Vader and Palpatine. Then at the end of the movie there's a fight on Hoth; there's AT-ATs\\, a trench the white-clad resistance fighters use to fight from\\, a rebel base with a huge blast door\\, and the ground is covered with snow... or salt\\, because one guy tastes it to make sure we know it's not snow and thus not Hoth.\\n\\nThis movie is loaded with problems and the biggest\\, baddest\\, most egregious one is that it is so\\, so\\, SO very boring. I couldn't believe a Star Wars movie could be as dull as this\\, but the proof is in the pudding.\\n\\nTo anyone who loves this movie\\, look within yourself\\, be honest and determine whether you're personal identity is too wrapped up in this franchise to admit this movie lacks luster. I was ready to like this movie\\, but I didn't make up my mind before I saw it and it's not a great personal defeat that Star Wars just isn't Star Wars anymore. I can always just watch Empire to feel good about the franchise.\\n\\nIt IS disappointing that this will almost certainly be the last time I see a new Star Wars movie in a theater; just when it appeared things were looking up Disney seems (SEEMS) to be firing anyone with different ideas for the franchise than their own and replacing them with the safest directors imaginable. Who wants to see Ron Howard direct a Han Solo movie? Who wants JJ Abrams to direct episode IX? I don't...","true":true}
