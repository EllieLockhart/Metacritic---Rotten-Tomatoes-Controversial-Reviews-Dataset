Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like they tried too hard to make a story that did not confirm to any fan theories. Very upset on how they treated characters that I grew up with.

I'll have to make a 2hr vlog about it...","true":true}
