Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie of all time. I am absolutely shocked with the vandalism of the Luke Skywalker character and bitterly disappointed that virtually none of the plot points from TFA were addressed. I wish I could love this movie but it's just terrible.","true":true}
