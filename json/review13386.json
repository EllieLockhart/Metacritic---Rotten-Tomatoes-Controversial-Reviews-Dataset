Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the force awakens. This was a let down. Worth seeing\\, but  just felt very clunky and anti-climactic. All the characters felt weaker in this movie.  Movie had a feel like it was always scrapping and clawing for traction and never got it.  Kind of like a DC movie vs a Marvel movie.  The CGI animals in this movie took away more than they added. Made no sense and felt like pasting a my little pony cuteness into the movie.  New alien species introduction was beyond weak.  New story characters had no depth. The new 'tech's and 'craft' was just strange and has no remote theoretical science behind it.  They did a lot as far as moving the story line along but it felt extremely rushed\\, but also felt like not much of material value actually happened in the movie.  They basically cut and paste scenes from both the Empire strikes back and return of the Jedi into this movie\\, demonstrating that new ideas and originality have little to no part in this franchise.  It's entertaining enough as it's own movie\\, I guess but a major let down from what I had personally hoped.","true":true}
