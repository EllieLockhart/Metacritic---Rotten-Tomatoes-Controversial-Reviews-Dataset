{"101487":169507,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2015-11-14","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS!!!\\n\\nThis review is for those who've seen the movie already. There's absolutely no way I can talk how I feel about this movie without spoiling anything. I'm sure most people reading this review would have seen the movie by now\\, but if you haven't yet\\, stop reading this review. You've been warned.\\n\\nSTAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI continues the saga following Rey trying to find her true place in the galaxy with the help of an older Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile\\, the Resistance has been nearly completely destroyed by the First Order and is doing all they can to keep the few remaining members alive with the aid of Finn\\, Poe\\, and Leia.\\n\\nI waited a little longer to gather my thoughts on this movie before I review it because there was SO MUCH to digest. This is the longest STAR WARS movie we've had yet with probably the most challenging to think about since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Director Rian Johnson clearly wanted to bring something different to the franchise. There is a lot\\, and I mean a LOT\\, of ambition in this movie. There were so many things here that were totally unexpected. It wasn't just some clever plot twists\\, but how the characters evolved from the previous movies. Luke has changed\\, he's not who we used to know in the original trilogy. He's apprehensive about training Rey and you understand why he failed as a Jedi Master. He was teaching Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) at the First Jedi Temple and made a mistake about attempting to murder him because he sensed the Dark Side in him\\, he couldn't let him become the same way Darth Vader had become. Feeling betrayed by the Jedi\\, he turns to them by destroying the temple and murdering Luke's students. You understand why Luke's acting so differently because you feel how much this tragedy has affected him. This answers the question from THE FORCE AWAKENS why he was hiding from everyone. But\\, he hasn't completely changed\\, he's still Luke Skywalker\\, he still cares about Leia and his friends. He expressed grief after learning about Han Solo's death\\, he was happy to see R2 again\\, he still shows dignity for C-3PO\\, and he cares deeply about his sister. And he's still being instructed by Yoda\\, telling him how failure is the greatest teacher. I thought the character choices made with Luke were very well done. Mark Hamill plays his character magnificently and I think this is his best acting performance yet\\, every single scene he's in\\, he owns it! The entire cast was incredible with their performances.\\n\\nKylo Ren is starting to become my favorite character in the new trilogy. He evolves as a character\\, he's showing that he hates being afraid and wants utmost confidence in his abilities\\, but he's still conflicted between the dark side and the light side. Snoke is teaching Kylo to gain his confidence by killing Rey\\, but Kylo instead kills Snoke. Kylo knows the power that Rey has through their communications\\, and he seized the opportunity to rule the galaxy as the Supreme Leader of the First Order and wants Rey to join him. These are clever callbacks to the original trilogy while also adding a new spin on it. This movie is full of moments like that. Another one of those moments is we learn a lot more about where Rey's parents come from. It appears that she isn't part of a lineage that is in line with the saga\\, they say her parents were just nobodies who sold her for drinking money. I really like the idea that those who are sensitive to the Force can come from anywhere\\, not just the Skywalker family.\\n\\nWe also get to explore the evolution of the Force. Throughout the entire saga\\, we learn how the Force can be used for. At the end of REVENGE OF THE SITH\\, Yoda tells Obi-Wan that his deceased master\\, Qui-Gon\\, found his way to immortality and can communicate to the living. Obi-Wan learns from this way of the Force and is able to project himself visually through the Force after he was killed. This has always been an interesting aspect for me when it comes to the mythical nature of the Force\\, and this movie really does a good job on how it evolves the Force. Now\\, Rey and Kylo learn the ways of the Force and are able to communicate with each other physically while still being alive. Luke has realized the power of the Force to confront his former student and to also save the Resistance\\, which ends up being the last thing Luke ever does because this kills him\\, it drained all the energy he had left in him. I was so sad to see Luke finally die\\, but I got to say that this was the absolute best way to send him off\\, he sacrifices himself to save his friends and his sister. Not only is this a beautiful farewell to Luke\\, but it's also a beautiful tribute to Carrie Fisher (Rest In Peace).\\n\\nThis leads to my main issues with the movie. Everything that I've just mentioned were so investing that it made everything else in the movie much less interesting. It's not necessarily the storyline itself about how the Resistance is at their lowest point and they're only down to just a handful of members left\\, that creates a lot of tension. But what they go through to try to survive really slows the movie down. We meet a few new characters in this movie that aren't given much development for me to get invested in them. There's a character named Rose who Finn meets to go on a secret to disable the tracking device that helped the First Order track the Resistance fleet through light-speed. It's an interesting idea\\, but I don't think it's executed properly. It creates a lot of pacing issues in the movie. This whole sequence just bored me to tears\\, it easily could've been a cut 15 or 20 minutes shorter\\, and it really should've been set in some place more imaginative. That's what really added to my boredom\\, the setting of that whole sequence was really unimaginative. Come on\\, you can place the characters someplace more interesting than some casino with aliens. It reminded of that scene in ATTACK OF THE CLONES where they're set in what looks like a 1950s style diner.\\n\\nThere's another new character named Admiral Holdo who takes command of the Resistance after Leia became unconscious after the First Order destroys the bridge of their ship which Leia was in\\, which should've killed her\\, she was sucked into the vacuum of space. But she somehow floats her way back to the ship through the Force. There has been a lot of ridiculous moments in the STAR WARS saga where the Force can play as a cop-out\\, but Leia floating in space to her ship like Superman... it's pretty silly. I guess you can excuse that she had the power of the Force to control the air pressure around her or something like that\\, but I don't know\\, that scene just did not feel right to me. Anyway\\, back to Holdo. On the one hand\\, I like how she's used to develop Poe's character. She argues a lot with Poe about how they should lead the Resistance. Poe wants to fight\\, Holdo wants to evacuate. This puts a new character twist on Poe\\, we think that he's going to tell the rest of the Resistance to help fight off the First Order\\, but it never happens\\, which I appreciate because they're in a situation where fighting is not an option. On the other hand\\, she overall felt like a big throw-away character to me. She ends up sacrificing herself to help save the Resistance by evacuating the remaining members and rams the ship towards the First Order fleet at light speed. It's a really powerful scene with an absolutely stunning visual effect that involuntarily made me go \\\"Whoa!\\\" As powerful as that scene was\\, I felt nothing for that character. I know she really cared about the Resistance and wanted what's best for them to make it out alive\\, but that's all her character was. She just argues and complains a lot.\\n\\nThere's quite a bit of humor thrown into this movie\\, which I have mixed feelings on. Some of it can really work\\, like when Luke begins to teach Rey about the true meaning of the Force. He tells her to close her eyes \\\"reach out\\\" with her feelings\\, but she literally reaches out with her arm and tries to feel something. This shows she's still a little naive. Another funny scene is how Chewie first interacts with the Porgs\\, he's cooking one of them and the Porgs just stare at him. Those moments are great. But some of the humor also creates abrupt shifts in tone\\, meaning that they would throw in a joke in a scene that's meant to be serious an dramatic. Like in one of the scenes where Rey is communicating with Kylo through the Force\\, they learn more from each other and it's getting very dramatic\\, and then suddenly a joke about Kylo having his upper body exposed. Really\\, did that really have to said? There are comedic moments like that throughout the movie and it really does mess with the tone.\\n\\nIn a franchise like STAR WARS\\, we expect the action scenes to be riveting and tons of fun to watch\\, and this movie probably takes the cake of having the best action scenes in the saga. Not only were they a blast\\, but they had meaning making the story all the more investing. And it is gorgeous to look at\\, the visuals are absolutely beautiful. There are also some unexpected moves in the action to that we've never seen in a STAR WARS movie. There's no lightsaber battle! I mean\\, yeah Kylo and Luke's projection confront each other is a standoff with their lightsabers\\, but it's never a battle\\, the sabers never clash\\, it was meant to be a distraction. How weird is that that there was never a lightsaber fight in a STAR WARS movie?\\n\\nI really admire Rian Johnson for really going in an entirely different direction for STAR WARS. So many twists that I did not see coming\\, and I'm always intrigued on where the story was going. This is a challenging and extremely unpredictable film\\, and it's really refreshing to see\\, especially for STAR WARS. This movie is basically Rian Johnson flipping the bird to fan theories\\, he doesn't have to listen to the fans\\, he doesn't want to\\, and he's not going to. And I love it! He put his own twist on the characters and on the Force. And you know what? It works! I don't care what anybody says.\\n\\nI know this movie is getting a lot of mixed reception with audiences\\, and I understand\\, this movie maybe a little too different for a lot of people. I was indifferent to it as well after I left the theater\\, I had no idea how to feel about it at first. There were so many that happened that when the movie ended\\, I was exhausted. But the more I thought about the movie\\, the more I understand the ideas that Rian Johnson was going for. I could've just reviewed my thoughts on the movie right after I got home from the theater like a normally do\\, but I took a few days to gather up my thoughts before I write my review because there was so much that was told.\\n\\nWould I consider this to be my favorite movie of the year? No. I still have my problems with the movie\\, it does have a lot of pacing issues and tonal inconsistencies\\, most of the new characters I really didn't care for all that much\\, and there were some truly ridiculous moments that took me out of the film for a bit. But for me\\, the good parts far outweigh the bad parts. It evolves the story\\, the characters\\, and the mythos of STAR WARS in a completely new direction with a lot of unexpected turns that I think really work. By the end of the movie\\, it seemed like I was watching the end of the trilogy\\, but I remember that there's still one episode left. With all these incredible twists and with so many characters now dead\\, I'm now REALLY curious to see how they're going to do Episode IX. And if it has me that excited for the next episode\\, I can safely say that THE LAST JEDI is a damn awesome movie and a worthy addition to the STAR WARS saga. I feel like I'm going to like this movie more and more every time I watch it\\, and I strongly suggest you do so too.\\n\\nGrade: B+","true":true}
