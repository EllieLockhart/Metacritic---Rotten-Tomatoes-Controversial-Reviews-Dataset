Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good if you dont like star wars because you wouldnt have gotten attatched to luke skywalker he was the biggest disappointment in the movie ryan johnson can go shove this piece of shit back to where it came from and i hate this movie more than the prequels for one simple reason it tarnishes the original trilogy wait till it comes out on dvd b4 you buy it or just dont buy it and save yourself from this steaming pile of shit","true":true}
