Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I very much enjoyed this film. It had some good humor\\, action\\, and emotion. They went a different way with Luke than I expected\\, but I didn't hate it. Was glad it diverged from expectations a bit.\\n\\nSome of the moments felt a little out of character at first\\, but considering that\\, between the previous trilogy and this trilogy\\, there is plenty of time for the characters to have grown\\, fallen\\, and changed.","true":true}
