Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've grown up with all the Star Wars films throughout my childhood and adolescence\\, and have a fond nostalgia for all of them. Having said that\\, I went into the theatre to see the Last Jedi without any spoilers\\, preconceived notions\\, or any expectations whatsoever. After seeing it and thinking about it\\, I can honestly say that it is the best Star Wars film I have ever seen\\, and not only that\\, but also the best film in general that I've seen for a long time. \\n\\nI absolutely loved it. The pacing\\, the length\\, the believable characters\\, the twists\\, the use of puppets and animatronics again\\, the comedy\\, the action and epic moments... all of it. Not to say it's completely flawless. It definitely has a few cheesy moments I thought were unnecessary\\, but overall\\, it was a blast to watch. I've never watched a film in my life and had my mouth drop open or feel like cheering in the middle of the theatre\\, until this one. Utterly awesome.","true":true}
