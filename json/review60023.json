Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I've played through the game twice\\,because I wanted to make sure it wasnt just a fluke\\,that the first time playthrough was a mesmerising\\,truly outstanding\\,bordering on cinematic masterpiece experience!!!

But sadly for all the haters\\,it was even better a 2nd time around\\,and Quite honestly I struggle to explain how brilliant the last of us part 2 is\\,from start to finish\\,hour after hour of relentless brutality\\,all bundled up in a ball of emotion\\,revenge\\,regret\\,redemption\\,fear\\,horror\\,love\\,cruelty\\,etc...just carnage! With a roller coaster of feelings whilst playing  it\\,I found I was completely immersed Into the story because of the writing\\,obviously\\,well also because all the characters are so brilliantly made\\, in every way\\,and naughty dog gave them a fantastic story too\\,I love the different perspectives we play from\\,the flashbacks and the action set pieces\\,all coming together beautifully\\,and all set in a world so graciously put together\\,either graphically\\,or through the story\\,or just the lore of the universe the game is set in\\,it all makes sense.Truly the best looking game ever\\,graphically its second to no game\\,frim character rendering\\,gunfights\\,animation to the little touches\\, like backpacks swaying realistically\\,footprints in the snow\\,water effects\\,animals in the surrounding areas\\,and lumps of blown up flesh sliding down walls\\,and so so so many more all bring it to life...its such a beautiful and well crafted world\\,I'm so impressed and I cant understand the hate this game is getting\\,especiallywhen you see weak story based games not getting as much hate\\,really sad to see!! Perhaps those haters should go play minecraft or Fortnite\\,better yet\\,call of duty!!! Leave the adult games for the actual adults\\,who have been waiting for a game\\,of this fame and caliber anyway\\,that utilises\\,maturity\\,violence\\,epic stories and emotion\\, among lots of other reasons\\,all of their god damn lives! I cant reccomend this game any more than I already have done! Dont read\\,or watch the reviews from the haters\\,just play it\\,and fall into the game world\\,if you love mature\\,gritty stories\\,then look no further!Best game I ever played\\,and I must say the elder scrolls and fallout games\\,and the star wars knights of the old republic games\\,were are my favourites\\,\\,so I'm not a part time gamer\\,and I know when I play a good game or not.The last of us part 2\\,ticks all the right boxes\\,it continues an already masterpeice of gaming in last of us\\,the original game\\,...and dare i say it\\,betters the original! But then it's just my opinion i guess....please play it\\,before being a critical\\,band wagon jumping prick!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
