Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How blatant can the agenda get?  All the bad guys are white.  Ray is an instant savant at everything she does\\, requires no training\\, has to save Kylo\\, a trained Jedi\\, from Snoak's red guards.  \\n\\nAdmiral Gender Studies shuts down Poe Dameron's \\\"mainsplaining\\\". All the women in this movie are wise and all the men are doofuses.  You have women fighting and dying in battles when in reality they'd be far away from anything resembling combat.\\n\\nWhen Kylo offered Ray his hand to join him in ruling the galaxy I wanted her to take it. That's how much I disliked the way the Resistance is portrayed.  I could identify more with the dark side than the light.  Great movie guys!","true":true}
