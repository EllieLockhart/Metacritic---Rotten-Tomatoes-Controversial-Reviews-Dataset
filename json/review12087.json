Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a Russian Bot! \\nMissed opportunity. Great visuals. Some really good moments. Overall\\, poor pacing until last act. Terrible humor. Disjointed. Heavy handed social comentary Did not seem to mess wither understand movies prior to it. . Sucked all the momentum out of the trilogy.","true":true}
