Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I would have written this review when I had first seen the movie\\, but now i have seen it multiple times and needed to to really know how I felt about ep VIII. At first I got up from my chair slightly entertained but utterly disappointed and angry even with so many awful decisions the movie The characters\\, their arcs\\, horrible conclusion to Luke\u2019s character\\, still no real answers to Rey\\, Snoke was totally pointless... so many other issues I just don\u2019t care anymore to go on and on about because I have wasted so much time dwelling on it. I just hate what this Star Wars episode did to the franchise. There is a reason why there is a petition out there with over 100k signatures on change.org to strike this movie from cannon\\, which would be so awesome and probably a pipe dream at this point. Hopefully Disney and the Star Wars team is getting the message though. This deserves all the flack it\u2019s receiving\\, because to me\\, it was not a Star Wars film....","true":true}
