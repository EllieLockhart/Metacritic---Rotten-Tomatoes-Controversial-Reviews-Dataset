Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute dumpster fire of a movie. \\n\\nWouldn't be half bad if it was a stand-alone film and wasn't called Star Wars\\, but it completely botched it's place in the sequels by retroactively changing characters established motives and personalities\\, prematurely killing off the established villain\\, reusing old characters\\, and adding in way too many plot-conveniences. \\n\\nFor sure played a huge role in why Rise of the Skywalker was such a mess - JJ couldn't salvage Ryan's mess if he tried.","true":true}
