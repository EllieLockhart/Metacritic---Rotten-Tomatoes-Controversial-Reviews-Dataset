Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an okay addition to the saga. However\\, it had so many scenes that were unnecessary. Like the milking scene???? (Kept vague so it doesn't spoil it.) JJ Abrahms did such a great job building up so many characters with The Force Awakens\\, while keeping the nostalgia of the original trilogy. And somehow\\, Rian came in and didn't follow up on the suspense or build up. It was almost like he wanted to wipe out the structure JJ put into the story line and start brand new by killing everything off. The best thing about star wars is its continuity\\, and Rian completely ruined that.","true":true}
