Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm standing on the right side of history here and calling it like it is. This film is opiate guff with no substance and death to a 40 year franchise by way of 1000 cuts.\\n\\nCampy. Lazy. Cynical. Contemptuous. Heretical of canon. Anti-Physics. Exposition Exposition Exposition. A script on par with The Room. No attention to the details. An extensive list of everything wrong with this film would most likely have a longer running time than The Last Jedi to read aloud.\\n\\nThose of you who believe this film is 4 or 5 stars - - - you are delusional - - - you are married to the hype. \\n\\nBut hype subsides. \\n\\nYour reality distortion field will shut down and you will be left (like the rest of us) empty of any emotional investment for this cinematic pulp. \\n\\nWe wanted this film to be amazing. We hate to hate on Star Wars. But listen to our conscience\\, we must. We hate because we really really care.\\n\\nBatman & Robin had a better screenplay. \\n\\nBitter? Me? Not Bitter... you're bitter...\\n\\nNooooooooooooooooooooooo!","true":true}
