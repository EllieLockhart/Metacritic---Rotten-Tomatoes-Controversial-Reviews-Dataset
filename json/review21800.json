Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just did not enjoy it too many of these new Disney jokes what all Marvel films have\\, the plot was awful\\, pointless characters\\, why didn't they just make a serpate star wars movie instead of just removing all of the orginal chacachters as much as possible","true":true}
