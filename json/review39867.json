Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a unique entry into the largely-debated franchise. Johnson is given the freedom that Lucas didn\u2019t have in the prequels. That is to take it wherever he wants to\\, even if it is different and unpredictable. This movie was never going to be like the original trilogy\\, and unlike the force awakens\\, it doesn\u2019t try to be.","true":true}
