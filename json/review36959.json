Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was not very good. It did not expand Snoke's story. We will never know how powerful a Sith lord he was. Jokes that had no real place in the movie. Did not stay consistent with Luke's character. Totally destroyed how powerful Luke is a nd what he believed in based on starwars lore. I preorder tickets so I was kind of stuck.I  would definitely be interested in getting my money back for the two tickets I purchased.\\nOverall character development was extremely poor.","true":true}
