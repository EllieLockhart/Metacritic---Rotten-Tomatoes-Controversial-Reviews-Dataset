Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the most efficiently directed Star wars movie after empire strikes back. The fresh portrayal of Luke Skywalker was interesting as it showed how he was in a dillemna. The movie was mainly on character development......Poe learns how to a good leader and take risky decisions while Finn learns that there is a group of people who take advantage of these wars for their own benefit.. the movie also shows what it is to be a rebel t-at sacrificing one's life for the greater good is necessary. Iconic scenes such as holdos light speed scene and the snokes room fight was awesome. Mainly the movie shows how the rebellion is struggling to bring Down the first order and how every character is learning from there failures to become better\\, even master Yoda pops up to lecture Luke...so in one word it was awwwwwwwesome!!","true":true}
