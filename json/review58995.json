We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game is good but not as good as its predecessor. I played the game with an open mindset since I saw how users hate the game\\, during the first 2 hours of the game we witness Joel's death and I won't say that it was a reasonable way to kill him... it was not\\, I expected that Joel would die in the game\\, how I expected that is pretty simple\\, this is Ellie's story not Joel and Ellie from the first game\\, it was clear from the E3 Reveal\\, game cover and from the interviews. The reason to why they killed Joel is reasonable but the way they killed him was unreasonable.\r\rThat brings me to Abby\\, I don't see a single reason why Naughty Dog thought that the player would sympathize with Abby. It is impossible to sympathize with the game's antagonist. Unlike Ellie\\, Abby is a very evil character\\, she has no morals... she kills her own with no remorse. Ellie on the other hand she is on a journey to \\\"Kill Every Last One of Them\\\" there are some scenes where Ellie kills Abby's friends\/followers and she doesn't feel good about it\\, she has morals unlike Abby. At the same time the fan base have known Ellie since the release of the game and people liked her from her silliness and overall a funny character while she was learning from Joel. Abby is a new character that begun with an evil approach\\, no one cares about her flashbacks with her dad\\, nor can sympathize when showing us that she plays with a couple of pooches.\rTHAT is why people sympathize with Ellie more than Abby.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
