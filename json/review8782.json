Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forced political agenda.\\nNo answers just more questions.\\nMost interesting new character is thrown away so emo Kylo can become the big bad.\\nRose falls in love with Finn in under 10 hours? like what the actual......\\nAll interesting concepts set up in TFA was brushed aside for this movie and it did not deliver. The first enjoyable part of the movie was when Yoda showed up and the scene in the throne room had a cool fighting scene I guess. Leia should have died. Captain Phasma was brought back just to be killed 2 minutes later. I'm so done. At this point they should just make a old republic trilogy and stay away from this era they are only making it worse and worse.","true":true}
