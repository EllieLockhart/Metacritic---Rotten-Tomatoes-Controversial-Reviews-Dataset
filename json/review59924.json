Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I tried to aviod all spoilers\\, but after 23.5 hours of almost nonstop playing I can say I was severely disappointed.  The game didn't run well for the first few hours.  The gameplay was a slightly more refined version of a 2013 PS3 game\\, but was overall pretty good.

The gameplay was a slightly more refined version of a 2013 PS3 game\\, but was overall pretty good.  The characters are very forgettable and act out of charactor for the sake of the plot constantly.  I also didn't find one single likeable character who stuck around.  The narrative of the game is shockingly bad.  The story seems poorly thought out and has one of the worst endings to a video game I have ever seen or played.  Old characters in general are treated like dirt and act out of character constantly\\, especially Joel.  It felt like the game killed the first game then p*ssed on its grave.  Not just that\\, but it felt like it just went out of its way to spit on and disrespect the first game.   But 1\/3 of the game also feels like a long sidequest.  The sounds and score are okay but forgettable.  On a positive note the graphics were the third best I've ever seen behind Red Dead Remption 2 and Zelda Breath of the Wild.\r\rI don't grade on a curve\\, on sites like IGN a 7 is average\\, for me a 5 is average.  On IGN Fallout 76 is a 5 for me it is a 3.  This game is a 3.5\\, it gets a point for booting up properly\\, a point for running at least okay for the most part\\, and a point for the good graphics\\, that's it.  I'll give it a half a point for the slightly improved gameplay but I can't give it a 3.5\\, but since the sound track and sound design are at least okay I'll give it a 4.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
