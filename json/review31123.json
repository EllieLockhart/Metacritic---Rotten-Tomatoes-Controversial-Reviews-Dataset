Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solid Star Wars movie. Would like for them to stop trying to make it a comedy. Some of the jokes or \u201cfunny moments\u201d seemed unnecessary. Wanted to find out exactly who Snoke was but was glad about the Kylo back story. ","true":true}
