Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killed a franchise via it's terrible plot\\, and disrespect for established characters.  New characters are terrible\/UNINTERESTING. Rey is a Mary Sue. Luke who saw that Darth Vader can still be brought back into the light side\\, suddenly decides to try and kill his nephew in his sleep because he sensed possibility of said nephew joining the dark side. Totally nonsensical.","true":true}
