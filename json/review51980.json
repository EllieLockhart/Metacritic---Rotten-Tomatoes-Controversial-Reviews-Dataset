Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a long wait we had \\\"Star Wars VII: the Force Awakens\\\" which was a great tribute and nostalgia for Episode 4. Then came \\\"Star Wars: Rogue One\\\" which was a nice add-on explaining the Death Star among many others gaps we had about the movies. I have been waiting for \\\"Star Wars VIII - The last Jedi\\\" ever since the Force Awakens was released. That said I am not a hard core fan of Star Wars but I enjoy them a lot except of course for the Episode 1\\, 2 and 3. I will not talk about any spoiler concerning this movie but I would like to share 1 thought and that is they are unable to make any evil person better than Darth Vader or at least match it and that is the sad part in Star Wars 7 and 8. Overall the movie is entertaining but contains some far fetched concepts and does not put it at the classic level that we had hoped for.","true":true}
