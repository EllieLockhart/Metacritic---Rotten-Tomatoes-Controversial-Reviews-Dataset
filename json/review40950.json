Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie didn't make sense. Its not really a star wars movie because there is no central story its like a dumb teen drama or an after school special with expensive cgi. I've seen more heart and story on an episode of saved by the bell.","true":true}
