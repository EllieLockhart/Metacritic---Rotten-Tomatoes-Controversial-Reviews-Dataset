Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible to say the least.  A disgrace to the original trilogy.  Disney screwed over star wars.  Its sad when the best part of the movie was when it ended.","true":true}
