Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's shiny and pretty. Everything one might expect from a Disney movie. But it lacks real plot and heart. Aside from the shabby treatment of beloved original trilogy characters\\, this movie does little to nothing with it's new cast. Effectively having them perform pointless and failure riddled tasks that does nothing to show character growth. The weak attempt at deconstructing Empire Strikes back is both evident and heavy handed.This movie does little in innovating what  the venerable franchise and wastes theopportunity presented by JJ Abrams The Force Awakens to just insult older fans at every turn with potentially good moments that get deflated by ill timed and pointless jokes. In the end it tries too hard to be Guardians of the Galaxy and not hard enough to be Star Wars. If you were hoping for  something genuinely new then this film will disappoint in every way. It's truly a shame to see so much potential wasted for the sake of trying to appeal to current societal sensibilities and letting that get in the way of a well told story. Like many others I will be opting out of the third installment of the trilogy.","true":true}
