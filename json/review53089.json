Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A superb\\, if idiosyncratic\\, instalment to the Star Wars saga.\\n\\nDespite a middling second act\\, The Last Jedi is a strong film in and of itself\\, and a welcome\\, refreshing change of pace as a Star Wars film. \\nI found myself unsettled by - but enjoying - the uncertainty around the fates of each character in the film. No character is truly safe\\, and TLJ likes to tease directions before unexpectedly changing course. It was fun to watch a Star Wars film that kept you on your toes.\\n\\nA strong opening and a note-perfect third act bookend a bold\\, textured film that is unafraid to take risks and rejects expectations\\, whilst never losing sight of a sense of fun nor the key message at the heart of the 1977 original. \\n\\nIf The Force Awakens was nostalgia at its finest\\, this was very much anti-nostalgia\\, and moves the saga forward in a big way. It very much feels like The Force Awakens was Episode 6.5\\, and this the true starting point for these new characters.","true":true}
