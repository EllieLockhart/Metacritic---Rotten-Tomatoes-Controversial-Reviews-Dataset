Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this movie at midnight on premiere night\\, I got to the cinema very early and saved two seats next to me for some close friends who were running late\\, I even dressed up as a First Order Stormtrooper. After the movie finished\\, my two friends looked at me to see what I thought\\, and I just said to them \u00e2umm I\u00e2(TM)m not sure\u00e2?. I watched the movie 6 more times\\, a couple of times alone\\, a couple of times with other friends\\, and still I didn\u00e2(TM)t know if I liked the movie or not. I\u00e2(TM)m a pretty big Star Wars fan and I\u00e2(TM)ve liked every movie in the franchise almost straight away.\\n\\nI spent many hours thinking about this movie\\, but couldn\u00e2(TM)t work out why I was having so much trouble liking it\\, it\u00e2(TM)s a Star Wars movie after all\\, but then I realised that it ruined all the other Star Wars movies that had come before. \\n\\nIt had done NOTHING with the plot threads teased at the end of The Force Awakens (who was Snoke? Who was Rey?) and did not feel like it should have been the second instalment of a trilogy. \\n\\nIt also destroys everything about hyperspace in all the previous films\\, making all the battles feel obsolete and pointless. Why didn\u00e2(TM)t they always just hyperspace ram the enemy?? \\n\\nI dont like this film\\, it has tarnished the whole franchise to me. Rian Johnson obviously knows nothing about good story telling and has no love for Star Wars.","true":true}
