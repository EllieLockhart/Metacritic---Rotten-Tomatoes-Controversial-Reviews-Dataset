Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than the Force Awakens\\, at least created some things new\\, even if rotten! Interesting Luke's evaluation of the Jedi order\\, the weapons industry profiting from both sides and some political undertones.  Still unknown what's happening at the galaxy at large\\, what is the first order or the resistance\\, the infamous mystery boxes from Jar Jar. It is so depressing  that our heroes after exploding the Death Star and defeated the emperor are now old but still fighting and dying out of screen... Worst space chase ever\\, stupid antagonists and mind boggling woke story culminating on the cringest scene ever recorded on a galaxy far far away. George's prequels are Shakespeare compared to to Jar Jar trilogy.","true":true}
