Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi killed any joy Star Wars films use to have. Thanks to soulless story lines\\, weak characters and forced diversity I don't care if I ever see another Star Wars film. Disney managed to suck the life out of it.","true":true}
