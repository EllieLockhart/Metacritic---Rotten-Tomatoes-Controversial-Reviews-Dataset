Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible for fans\\, director \/ writer has no idea what an intergalactic civil war is at all. Worse he has no idea what a hero is. I am done with Star Wars after 30 years of love. Hope you can like it\\, acting is good throughout.","true":true}
