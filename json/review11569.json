Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible story. Direction was ok.  Entertaining movie.  But the story.. OMG.. who was the moron that let any of these people anywhere near the Star Wars story.??? They just messed it up.  First thing my 10 year old son told me after watching it.  \\\"I didn't like it\\\".  They just lost a couple of fans and customers\\, forever..!!","true":true}
