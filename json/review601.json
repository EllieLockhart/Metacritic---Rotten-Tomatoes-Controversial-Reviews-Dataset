I got enough of the slow placed adventure type of games in the 80 and 90s. But Until dawn does some things that really makes it enjoyable and even a little original. One thing it does right is its characters\\, sure they are all stereotypes \\, but most are very likable even lovable and a couple are not so likable\\, depending on your personality.  Navigating and watching over this attractive and likable group of people really sets off your protective instincts. You grow attached to the girls and want to see them get out and alternatively dislike some of them and want to see them die. While its setting is also a bit generic\\, it beautiful and well crafted and the feel that you are the puppet master of this crazy horror movie is an experience that really stood out for me.\rThere is a formula here that could very easily be explored for a couple more games\\, borrowing from more troupe horror films\\, giving us new beautiful and zany characters to protect or let die. I think adding more mini games and more branching paths would go a long way ( Learn from tell tale and evolve) \\, but for now Until Dawn really is a must play for most Horror fans\\, just for that feeling of living a horror movie.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
