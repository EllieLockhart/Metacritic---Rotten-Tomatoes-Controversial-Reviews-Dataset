Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Doesn't even deserve one star.\\n\\n-Attack run on AT-ATs was pointless\\n-Finn\/Rose convoluted storyline ruins pacing\\n-Superman Princess Leia made me want to throw things at the screen\\n-Poe vs Laura Dern's character - ends up being pointless and wastes lots of screentime\\n\\nThese four points alone are enough to ruin what would have been a decent movie.","true":true}
