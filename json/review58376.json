Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After first seeing it I would have given it a higher rating\\, but then I started to think about it. So\\, about 30-45 minutes of plot could have been completely removed with a couple of lines of dialogue between pink haired admiral and Poe\\, but she gives him the same level of respect the Empirials give their subordinates\\, so we get a bunch of useless stuff that makes everything worse. Also\\, the Force has been turned into a magical sentience that\\, more than ever\\, just arranges things to happen\\, this explanation given by Snoke as to why Rey is so unbelievably powerful. That is\\, Kylo had become such a strong force user that the Light side had to create a champion to face him. I know that Star Wars always had a bit of chosen one syndrome\\, but this is just beyond the pale. The gritty universe of Star Wars is now a Young Adult Novel\\, chosen one special young people and all. You can keep it.","true":true}
