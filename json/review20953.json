Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was filled with hope after feeling Rogue One encapsulated the spirit of the original trilogy\\, so going to see The Last Jedi I was hoping this was going to be repeated. Pretty soon within the movie\\, I was left bewildered at the depiction of characters and lore that has been around for nearly 40 years. Lots of the questions raised in The Force Awakens weren't answered or were just thrown away with no satisfactory conclusion to make way for confusing plot decisions and character changes. I want to like it\\, I really want to like it but I just can't and really don't understand the overwhelming praise by movie reviewers. I feel Star Wars is a genre in itself where as fans we collectively understand the direction and atmosphere of the universe but much like with The Phantom Menace\\, we were jolted in a direction  we neither expected or felt comfortable with during The Last Jedi.","true":true}
