Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from a few moments of poor dialogue\\, it was a wonderful Star Wars movie and one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time. Kept me guessing until the end\\, and had rich emotional payoffs. Some superfans will be put off by the unfamiliar content\\, but I think it did a great job of moving the franchise into the modern age.\\nPROS: Beautifully shot\\, great acting from the leads\\, keeps you guessing.\\nCONS: Some weak dialogue\\, could use more worldbuilding\\, needs more gays.","true":true}
