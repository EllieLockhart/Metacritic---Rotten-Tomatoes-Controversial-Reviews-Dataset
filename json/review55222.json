Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just bad. \\nNo storytelling. Major continuing mistakes. Boring plot.\\nToo many unanswered questions.\\n\\nSPOILERS AHEAD.\\n\\nWhy the hell did Rey stay for 2 nights or so at Lukes temple thing with his housemaids and the other characters on the ships only fly in one direction for the whole time. \\nHow can it be an awesome plot that two people need to find a master codebreaker to get into a room on the enemy ship to destroy some tracking device. It is just boring. The prequels are amazing movies compared to that movie.\\nGetting specific\\, how can Luke touch Leia as a Ghost? Like this is just so stupid from every person who was part of that production. \\nWhy do they add stupid jokes which destroys every kind of tention. Not that there is any\\, but with a few tweaks the movie could be good. Just cut out some mirrorcrap - scenes and add some good character development.\\nAnd why do you make people anxiuos about Rey's parents and then just tell the audience they are not relevant. Like WTF\\nI was a diehard fan. But of Star Wars\\, not this shit","true":true}
