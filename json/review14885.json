Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly think this is a good film and a good addition to the Star Wars series. It seems like people who don't like it are uspet with the risk they took. Which is why I enjoyed it. It's not perfect but it's something new and different. ","true":true}
