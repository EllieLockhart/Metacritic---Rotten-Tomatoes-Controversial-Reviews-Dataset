Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first I did not have a problem with this movie. I thought it was OK\\, but I did not see myself going and seeing it for a 3rd or 4th time like I did with the previous ones. Bought the Blu Ray and it got progressively worse for me. For the first time I am not eager to see the next one.","true":true}
