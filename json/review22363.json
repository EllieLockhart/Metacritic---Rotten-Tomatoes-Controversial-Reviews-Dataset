Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lazy\\, lazy film\\, thoroughly annoying and spitting in the face of 40 years of Star Wars. So lazy that even your 5-star-Review -Bots can't think of anything else to say then:\\\"Thoroughly enjoyable for any Star Wars fan!\\\". REALLY? There must have been a lot of envelopes changing hands and Disney knew fine well what a desaster of a movie they produced. How comes the majority of Audiance Reviewers absolutely condemn the film \\, but its still at 50% at Rotten Tomatoes? Only solution: REMAKE VIII !!","true":true}
