Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took everything that the Force Awakens was setting up and throws it all out of the window. While a lot of fans weren't big on that movie\\, at least it didn't have two subplots that ultimately lead to nothing but 40 minutes of wasted screen time. Rey\/Luke and Kylo Ren are the best parts of the movie and that storyline should have been the focus of the whole movie.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a mix of Empire and Return without any of the surprises (except for an appearance by an old character) and shock that made those movies great. Not really interested anymore in seeing where things lead.","true":true}
