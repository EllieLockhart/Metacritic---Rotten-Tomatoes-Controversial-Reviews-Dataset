Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as I love Star Wars\\, this one will not go down as a \\\"great\\\" or even \\\"good\\\" SW Film.  However\\, the sound\/picture\/effects and detail in this film are hands down amazing. This looks and sounds like a Star Wars movie. But the story and characters are just bad. Rey is a Mary Sue. Rose is boring and her subplot with Finn is garbage. This movie unfortunately also seems to be fueled by political agenda. Hopefully things can turn around.","true":true}
