Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets one star for great acting and effects. But the utter poverty in basic storytelling skills leaves this movie in shambles. I have ZERO desire to see episode 9.  How in the world could you kill off the mysterious villain after 30 min of screen time with no answers on who he is? How could you kill off the main hero in the franchise with another movie left to go?  AND HOW COULD YOU KEEP PRINCESS LEIA ALIVE WITH A WHOLE YEAR TO CHANGE THE STORY????  Utter stupidity that dishonors the story\\, the fans\\, and Carrie Fisher's memory. It boggles the mind.","true":true}
