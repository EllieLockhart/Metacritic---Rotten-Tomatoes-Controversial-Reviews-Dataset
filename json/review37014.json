Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was up and down good and bad never steady the story just didn't flow properly and some of the characters didn't get the proper screen time like Captain Phasma what happened I thought she was supposed to be a Badass and she's Dead already common Disney and then Luke what seemed to be A Master Jedi is now Dead to really Disney how could you approve this Film your going to ruin something great and trust me there were more flaws with the film than just what I mentioned just still can't believe they Approved this Film!!","true":true}
