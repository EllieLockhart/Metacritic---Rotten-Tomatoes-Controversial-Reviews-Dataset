Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was not a fan of the force awakens but when you make a 3 part intervonnected story continuity is key and the very different visions of these two different directors really shines in the words ways I enjoyed more of this movie than the last but Johnson went such a different way than what jj had obviously intended","true":true}
