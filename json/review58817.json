The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Normally\\, I do not write reviews but this game was a huge disappointment and is probably one of the most overrate games of all time. The Last of Us 1 was not great because of its gameplay. No\\, it was all about its great story. And I also expected a great story from part 2. But the story in part 2 is pretty bad. Almost no character development\\, many plot holes and the timeline of the story is inaccurate. In fact\\, the game is almost too long. You have too many characters and the game is split into two parts whereas you play another character in the second part.  And the final chapter of the game seems to be incomplete which makes it basically needless. In the first game\\, the story was only focused on the relationship between Joel and Ellie and its development. And as already mentioned\\, in this game are too many characters involved which makes the story overloaded. There aren't even any improvements of the gameplay. And for a game that takes place after a zombie apocalypse\\, there are not so many encounters with zombies except for the first few hours. Mostly\\, you have encounters against hordes of humans which can be annoying. The graphics are nice\\, but not the best on the PS4. God of War has better graphics. The most controversial about this game are the SJW elements. Nobody had any problems with Ellie but if the old\\, white man Joel has to be killed to get more diversity is a disgrace for every fan of the first title. ND denied to follow a political agenda\\, but the developers clearly made some statements before the release and keep doing it on Twitter. Most people have no problems with a female or a whatever character. No\\, most people gave a negative rating because of Joel's death and this awful story. It is unbelievable that Metacritic deleted some negative reviews. Most negative reviews are pretty detailed compared to the positive ones which are superficial. And if you are interest in a game that should be frightening and also be about zombies: better buy Resident Evil 7 or Resident Evil 2.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
