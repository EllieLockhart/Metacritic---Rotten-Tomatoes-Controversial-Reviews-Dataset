Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall is a ok movie withn fancy space battleship scenes\\, but there are so many questions need to be answer in order to make the plot more interesting. Its sad to see Luke gone. ","true":true}
