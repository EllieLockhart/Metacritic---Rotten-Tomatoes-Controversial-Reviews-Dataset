Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE I'VE SEEN! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS! With a bad plot\\, useless subplots\\, underdeveloped characters\\, bad acting\\, and characters making painfully stupid choices\\, this movie was unbearable to watch. It went against everything that has been established so far and is only somewhat bearable if you know absolutely nothing about star wars. ","true":true}
