Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a dissapointing failure\\, I've been a fan since the first movie came out\\, I felt it was something special and a good reason to go to the movies\\, fun and imaginative... I don't know what this is about anymore\\, lack of a good story\\, it does have good visuals\\, but no more than that.","true":true}
