Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie has simply killed all of my love for the starwars universe and considering starwars was a form of religion for me I hope it's clear enough that to me this movie is not even worth one single star. The plot doesn't make any sense\\, the characters are inconsistent and mostly useless and probably the most representative scene is the levitating-in-space princess leia\\, to be kind the movie is a parody so to a certain extent you may have a laugh\\, I did\\, but the price is starwars is now dead. RIP. I'll keep watching the original trilogy without CGI.","true":true}
