Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finn\\, who was my favorite from the last movie\\, was given a crap storyline that was made worse by the stupid casino scene. It felt like the monkeys in the fourth Indiana Jones to me. Too many stupid comedic characters\/moments. Some are fine\\, but Hux was too stupid for his rank. Chewie should have eaten those creatures. Poe's arc could have been better. I wanted interaction between Finn and Poe. Instead Finn went off on another adventure. Rose\/Finn romance building was heavy handed. The elite is evil money mongerers was preachy and annoying.\\n\\nI give this 2.5 because I loved half the movie: Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke's storyline. I liked Leia and Poe's interaction.\\n\\nPhantasma was wasted and an unnecessary addition to the story with how they used her. Just a ploy to get GoT fans?","true":true}
