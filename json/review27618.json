Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overly silly\\, stupid dialogue\\, plot made no sense. I am angry that this script was approved and horrified that this movie even exists. I cringed so much during this movie.. At one point I just had to look away. Is possible to return this movie? Can we give it back to Disney and say \\\"nope. You have to redo this.\\\"? This movie is is just further proof that 2017 HAS BEEN THE WORST YEAR EVER!","true":true}
