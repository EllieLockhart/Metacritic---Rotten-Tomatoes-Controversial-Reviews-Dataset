Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely garbage movie! The SJW themes are nauseating. Disney has effectively killed Star Wars for me. Luke's character was wasted like a fart in the wind.","true":true}
