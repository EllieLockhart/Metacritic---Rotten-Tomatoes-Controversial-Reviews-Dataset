Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie isn't awful\\, that said it really isn't all that good either. There were pieces of great potential in the movie\\, but overall I just did not enjoy it. The acting from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver was absolutely fantastic at times\\, but the rest of the performances feel cold and hollow. Whether it be due to Rian Johnson or J.J. Abrams\\, Hamil's performance compared to the rest of the series was awful. His character is all about seeing hope in the darkest places\\, and the writers or directors failed to portray this. John Boyega in my opinion should have died in this film. It would complete his character arc of leaving the Empire and sacrificing his life for the hope of something greater. It would have been emotional and a fitting send off. Admiral Holdo\\, played by Laura Dern\\, was my least favorite performance. Her scenes were terrible\\, and the decision not to tell Poe anything seemed to be an excuse to pad runtime or give Finn and Rose a reason to go to the casino planet. I feel like Carrie Fischer should have died in space\\, putting the Resistance at it's lowest point. In conclusion this movie is one full of flaws. To not pick every detail is futile\\, I'd be here all day. It simply wasn't a good movie\\, perhaps the next will redeem the past two. ","true":true}
