Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***Update***  Regardless of the stories you may have read recently\\, I am not part of the Alt-Right.  My review was not bought or manufactured.  I am a true fan of the series who dislikes this movie\/story for the reasons I listed below.  Stop making this political!!!\\nI love Star Wars.  In fact I loved the original trilogy\\, I even appreciated the prequel trilogy for what it was\\, and I loved the Force Awakens.  I had so much hope going into this episode.  This felt like a high dollar spoof of the entire Star Wars franchise\\, or maybe even a roast of its core mythology.  From Luke flicking the \\\"laser sword\\\" over his shoulder\\, to the green boob milk\\, to the dead flying Leia\\, to Luke dying for no reason\\, and everything in between\\, this movie was a total joke and a let down.  I am holding out for that one in a billion chance that Disney comes out and says\\, \\\"Just Joking... the real movie comes out next week.  Hope you enjoyed the laugh...\\\"  Rian\\, Disney\\, Mark - Seriously?!?!?!?!?","true":true}
