Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS but THE LAST JEDI is a legitimately wonderful film\\, built upon a 40 year legacy of these movies and their lore. Where Force Awakens was a broad strokes\\, gratuitous love letter to the franchise\\, Last Jedi feels like both a striking meta-narrative condemning a lot of what has come before\\, and the culture surrounding it\\, as well as a beautiful story about failure\\, and growing past our mistakes. To say that it's my favorite Star Wars film would be bold\\, but I don't know that I can say that it isn't. It isn't even close. It's not a perfect movie\\, and there's a point where it definitely feels like it drags\\, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The whimsical tone makes this movie feel like a larger-than-life anime at points\\, but somehow blends perfectly with these characters that are fleshed out way beyond anything I expected.  I love this movie so goddam much\\, y'all.","true":true}
