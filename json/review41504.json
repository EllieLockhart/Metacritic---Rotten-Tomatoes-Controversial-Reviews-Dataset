Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is bad\\, it looks pretty\\, but the action is terrible. Just the one fight scene is choreographed terribly\\, so many times they have to wait for the actors to get ready. Why was this the final cut?? It treated the original trilogy like garbage and is a hot stinky mess that I will never suffer through again.","true":true}
