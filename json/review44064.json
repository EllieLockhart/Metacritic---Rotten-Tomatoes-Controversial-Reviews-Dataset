Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a poorly written film with a nonsensical plot.  Many of the scenes in this film were utterly silly: the First Order's chase of the Rebels in space\\, Luke contemplating the cold-blooded murder of his nephew\\, Luke's reluctance to engage in the fight against the First Order\\, Leah's use of the force to fly in space (did anyone at Disney question the wisdom of this scene?) and the entire Canto Bight sequence.  Johnson's attempts at humor were cheesy and misplaced.  I have no interest in the characters (no fault of the actors) and\\, sadly\\, have little desire to see what happens in the final act of the Skywalker Saga.  \\n\\nDisney\\, please seek out talented writers and give your writers the time necessary to develop great stories.  These films have been rushed and the Star Wars franchise and the legacy of its characters have been tarnished as a result.","true":true}
