Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion is the best movie in the saga. People are asking the wrong questions and so they are judging the movie the wrong way. They're wanting the 1970s movie to come back\\, but that's impossible. I am a very resistant person to change and I did not like Force Awakens a bit and I doubted that Last Jedi was going to be in the least good\\, I am a fan of Expanded Universe\\, I love Darth Bane and Darth Revan and i hate Disyney for killing the Expanded Universe\\, but it got me of surprises and it was excellent! Disney has overcome itself in a way that I would never wait\\, introduced a new Star Wars\\, revitalized the saga completely\\, left that little box we lived in\\, I know it's hard to see Luke Skywalker die and leave the front line\\, but it is necessary\\, since Mark Hammil can not act as Luke of the Expanded Universe I enjoyed must of film\\, it was Luke's human side of being afraid and being consumed by the fear\\, consumed by the dark side\\, because he was traumatized almost crazy for having lost so much\\, we all know what it is to fail\\, but we can not imagine what it is see his father die\\, fight several wars and lose friends\\, only to end up repeating everything and Luke is a being a human not a steel man without emotions\\, he is hopeless. Many criticized that Kylo Ren is obsessed with the dark side\\, and I did not understand this criticism\\, because we should have known that the dark side consume the soul of the user and it is very difficult for her to come back and Disney did not back away from it\\, did not a fantasy where Kylo is super good. I loved the new creatures\\, George always said that this was important in the end and it's true. The action was very good and the end left the message\\, this is a NEW Star Wars. The Force is taking a new aspect of understanding.","true":true}
