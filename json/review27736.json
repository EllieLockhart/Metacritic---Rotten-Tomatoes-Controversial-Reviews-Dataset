Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People like to find something to complain about\\, and in 2017 it was this film. This movie was a fantastic change of pace coming off of Force Awakens. The cinematography\\, in particular\\, was mind-blowing. If people take issue with the comedic additions in this film\\, one of the most painful lines in the Star Wars saga was uttered in their beloved Force Awakens - Fin desperately asking Rey if she has a boyfriend. The Last Jedi is refreshingly new where Force Awakens was traditionally stale.","true":true}
