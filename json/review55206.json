Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ set up so many mysteries in TFA that Ryan just doesn't care about and uses to his advantage to throw you off\\, this is what divides fans I believe. \\n\\nThe risks it takes and unpredictability makes it easily worth the watch. Add in to that the great story arcs that SOME of the characters take\\, the obligatory amazing cinematography\\, sound design and score for each character makes it great. The fact that it does incredibly unpredictable moves\\, some pay off amazingly\\, some not so much. The other side of this i other story arcs are literally pointless\\, drawn out\\, boring\\, and unnecessary.\\n\\nI likes most things that I've read others hate\\, however I do not like about half of the main characters story arcs\\, they were long drawn out (like this review) however the other half way pure gold in my stupid opinion. \\n\\nIf anything this movie proves that all movies are subjective. It also proves some people can't agree with even that from others comments. \\n\\nSo overall\\, go see it if you want\\, judge for yourself\\, or not...just live your life","true":true}
