Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was what the saga needed something different something new. It builds on what the force awakens already had great characters and then the last jedi gives an interesting plot to let the characters grow or fall in these situations and that's what makes it so great.","true":true}
