Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a line in the trailer ( so this is not a spoiler) where Luke says \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\"\\n\\nThis was a message to us\\, the fans.\\n\\nThrow any preconceived notions you may have right out the window before you go see this\\, and view it with an open mind\\, and you might just be blown away.\\n\\nIf not\\, you may walk away angry and confused.\\n\\nI can't really say more than that.","true":true}
