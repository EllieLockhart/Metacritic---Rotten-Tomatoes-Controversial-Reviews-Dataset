Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been and always shall be a Star Wars fan\\, but I truly hated The Last Jedi. The production had a social agenda instead of simply trying to make a coherent and exciting Star Wars film: This agenda tried to muddle and ruin the entire new trilogy. Rise of Skywalker had to undo the rubbish that was The Last Jedi simply to close out the new trilogy on a positive note and save the spirit that was in The Force Awakens and the original Trilogy. I watched trash The Last Jedi twice\\, and that is all I will ever watch it. I immediately saw Rise of Skywalker three times opening week and will watch it many\\, many times forward. The Last Jedi is in the bottom three of Star Wars films; it is miserable. ","true":true}
