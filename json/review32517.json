{"101487":170066,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi a.k.a. \\\"Mr. Plinkett is going to have a field day with this one\\\"\\n\\n   I've never signed up to Rotten Tomatoes before nor have I ever cared to write a review until I saw this movie.  I am not a bot and I'm not here to be a troll.  Just my honest opinion and this is not a fake review.\\n\\nI will preface this by saying that I liked The Force Awakens with a \\\"but\\\" attached to it.  Yes\\, it was a clear retread of A New Hope\\, but i feel it needed to start on familiar ground with a familiar premise to get the new generations of Star Wars movies into motion.  I hated that Rey was made into a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" of the Force (someone who is an expert or the best at everything with little to no experience)\\, but with a well told retread of a story\\, and huge future potential on the direction of the series\\, I was giving The Force Awakens a pass despite the negative issues with the movie.  It had character development and introduced personalities of the characters which I thought were going to be developed in The Last Jedi.  It had plot\\, character\\, and feeling.  Generally\\, it was headed in the right direction.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was visually stunning.  I wanted to like it.  I really did.  At the same time in no particular order it was also poorly written\\, pacing was choppy\\, lacked any sense of logic when put in relation to the previous canon\\, terrible story-line concepts\\, the direction of The Force Awakens was completely negated along with some of the canon in the original movies\\, most of of the existing characters were not developed further\\, Rey continued to be a bigger \\\"Mary Sue\\\" than ever before with next to no training by Luke\\, was filled with SJW themes\\, too much feminism and misandry (keep your politics and SJW agenda out of Star Wars\\, Disney)\\, time was wasted on new characters for the sake of diversity which drug the plot down further\\, forced romance from a new character as horribly unconvincing as Anakin and Padme in Attack of the Clones\\, plot twists for the sake of plot twists\\, porgs\\, and it blended certain story arcs from A New Hope\\, Empire Strikes Back\\, and Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nBecause of the above list\\, unfortunately\\, Disney has horribly broken Star Wars at Last Jedi and there is no chance of recovery.  I will be getting off the Star Wars train and pretend this movie didn't happen.  I will also not be seeing any more movie Star Wars movies from Disney in the theatre.  Is there really a need to tell a back story to Han Solo?\\n\\nIf you like stunning visuals\\, superficial character development\\, a choppy\\, incoherent\\, illogical plot\\, plot holes\\, SJW concepts such as capitalism is bad\\, animal abuse is bad\\, \\\"make love not war\\\"\\, every bad guy being a white male\\, and neutering every positive protagonist male in this movie\\, or you are only a casual fan of Star Wars\\, you'll probably like this movie.\\n\\nIf you are a long time die hard like myself who instead of being entertained by visuals\\, was more interested in the story\\, plot\\, and how it ties into the regular canon of the previous movies and have it make sense and not have it riddled with political SJW B.S.\\, then don't see this movie.  Pretend it doesn't exist.  Wait for the blu-ray and rent it if you must.  You will be disappointed.\\n\\nLast Jedi is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole into the movie series.\\n\\n1\/2 star for the pretty visuals.\\n\\nP.S.  I wonder if it's too late to get George Lucas back for a do over...\\n\\nP.P.S.  Mr. Plinkett\\, please get started at what you do best!","true":true}
