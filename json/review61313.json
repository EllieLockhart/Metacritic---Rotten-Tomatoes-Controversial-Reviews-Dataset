Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Well\\, I usually don't write reviews but I've been playing Naughty dog games since the year 2013 and loved it\\, My First Naughty Dog Game was The Last of Us\\, and it still is a masterpiece\\,\rJust finished playing Last of Us 2\\,\rAnd I think it's not worth it and definitely\\, not at a masterpiece\\,\rThis time Naughty Dog botched up the story\\, without hearing to the fans that were so much excited about this game\\, and I was one of them.\rGameplay\\, Sound\\, Graphics are all awesome and really like playing it but for what\\,\rThe STORY does not have a conclusion and neither does the starting\\, on how the game does it with its most beloved character.\rHere is what I felt after playing the entire game:\r\r# Why keep crying and remembering the main character (that you loved him so much) and Giving him death in the first place.\r* Decent gameplay from this main character to the end of the game was expected\r# The First part of \\\"Last of Us\\\" makes us think about the decision that Joel has taken in the end\\, and even now\\, it's debatable. I shook me for one week after I played it.\r* Part 2\\, does not have any impact\\, except Its gameplay\\, which I can play in multiplayer factions anytime\\, plus its ending seemed like a typical movie ending which was not so hard to figure.\r# in the first part I liked bonding between two characters\\, like Tom and Jerry\\, Chip and Dale\\, etc\r* Here two don't have access to Second Character.\r\rIn the Ending when Joel Said: \\\"If somehow the Lord gave me a second chance at that moment...  I would do it all over again\\\".\r\rAnd that's what we wanted and I think most of the fans will agree with me\\,\r\rThis Game could have been much better but don't know what the Studio was thinking about\\,\rthey made it worse like Game of Thrones ending\\, I think its goodbye to last of us franchise.\rReally Enjoyed past 7 years playing\u2026 Expand","true":true}
