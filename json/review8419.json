Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with unnecessary plot twists and bad acting Rian Johnson fumbles the star wars trilogy. Mark Hamill was right in saying this is a different Luke. Its the worst depiction of Luke from any series. Luke has reverted to the  whiny brat from a new hope\\, maybe even younger. Also the constant mention of hope was a strong push to tie this in the 1977-83 trilogy. The acting is bad and its not the actors; its the director\/writer. Star wars gave us a canvas of a far away place. With the dialogue such as Fin taunting Phasma puts this in the present:2017. Thank you\\, Rian.","true":true}
