Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1) Yay\\, heteronormativity! ?? Apparently in a galaxy far away\\, there were never any LGBTQ+ sentient life.\\n2) Now we know that all the stormtrooper armor money was spent on Phasma\\, since hers is the only armor that works.\\n3) SNOKE? WTF?! Why? Who? How?\\n4) I swear parts of the film reminded me of a reboot of Spaceballs.\\n5) If Adam Driver were shirtless the entire film\\, it would have been the greatest movie of all time.\\n6) Nostalgia can be good\\, but also overused.\\n7) CGI was better than #JusticeLeague.\\n8) Ginger Hitler is still bae ??\\n9) What was up with the so-so cameos? ????\\n10) Lots of Hasbro potential ??","true":true}
