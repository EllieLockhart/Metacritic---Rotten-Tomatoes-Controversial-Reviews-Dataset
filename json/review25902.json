Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOT good.  This movie does not fit in so many ways\\, with ANY of the other Star Wars movies.  Characters\\, battle scenes\\, creatures\\, values\\, story morals... they get it all wrong.  Luke is not Luke.  Leia flying through outer space like Superman after getting blown up?  Are you kidding me?  No.  I can't believe Lucas or anyone else that cares about Star Wars signed off on this.","true":true}
