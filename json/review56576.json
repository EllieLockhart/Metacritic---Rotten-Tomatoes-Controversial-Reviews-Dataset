Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an amazing movie\\, and really put a great ending to the past trilogy. The point of star wars is to divide many trilogies of a long story about a galaxy far far away that keeps facing war\\, economic depression\\, messy politics\\, and everything a government in a country in our world would. As apart of the generation that grew up with the prequels\\, I struggled in finding joy in the movies\\, but the first time I saw A New Hope\\, I was obsessed. It made me understand the prequels\\, though I hate them. Then I heard about the new trilogy\\, and I was worried it would turn out to ruin the story line. We need to accept the new trilogy and how this movie ended\\, for the new generation to grow up with a different story about different characters. Disney has written this movie the way it is to do this exact thing. It is the best acting out of all of the movies\\, especially for Mark Hamill\\, who we see has gained more experience. They really captured the idea of what the dark and the light side is and how it ties in to the war between each faction. I didn't enjoy what happened throughout the movie\\, but how it was visualized and how it transitioned scene to scene was flawless\\, making it a very enjoyable movie.","true":true}
