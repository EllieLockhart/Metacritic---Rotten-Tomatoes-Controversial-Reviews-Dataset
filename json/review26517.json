Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Officially the worst in the whole saga. The Marry Poppins scene .. ick.  Why does the largest ship ever seen in the whole saga only have one gun to destroy the transports? The whole plot is so flawed its hard to take anything seriously\\, and even if you didn't want to be serious its hard to follow with plots that go nowhere\\, political agendas\\, and things that don't happen in science (gravity in space to drop \\\"bombs\\\" ..  leah not freezing )  .. not to mention there would be way more tie-fighters on a ship that size carrying the supreme commander ..  How does Poe not get shot dragging Rose across the ENTIRE battlefield - they just magically \\\"show up\\\" at the door.  Yoda scene ... not funny - cringeworthy.","true":true}
