Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is amazing! Everytime I thought I knew what was going the happen\\, Rian Johnson spins it around and kept me at the edge of my seat. Some moments did lack the excitement I would have hoped for but what I wanted to see compared to how it all came together is very miniscule. Overall this movie is a must see. Don't look at the negative that some reviews say\\, just go in with an open mind and let the force be with you.","true":true}
