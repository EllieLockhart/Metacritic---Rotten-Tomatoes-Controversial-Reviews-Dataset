Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was there in 1977\\, and have been hooked ever since. I wasn't all that pleased with the prequels\\, but the sequel trilogy is turning out to be a lot of fun to watch. I went in to see The Last Jedi with the same enthusiasm I usually go in with\\, but I was beyond surprised. This one made me feel like that eight year old again. So many thrills and surprises\\, even for me\\, a spoiler hound. I loved this movie! It may be my most favorite of all.","true":true}
