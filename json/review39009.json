Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They took the franchise into a different direction\\, and I'm not sure true day 1 fans will all approve. I understand wanting to push the series forward\\, but you have to be respectful of what's come before it. There was no precedent for a few BIG things Rian Johnson did in the film\\, so the moves felt out of place. Too many plot holes that fans of the saga will easily point out. Rian Johnson\\, with this movie\\, proved to me and the rest of the world that he didn't grow up on Star Wars like I did. ","true":true}
