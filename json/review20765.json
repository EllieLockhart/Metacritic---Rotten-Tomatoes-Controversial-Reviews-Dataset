Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like it. I wanted to love it\\, but . . . . This movie is simply high budget garbage. Illogical plot\\, out of character decisions\\, no homage paid to the previous films\\, previously complicated and conflicted characters turned into one dimensional objects to be run over by a childish writer. If Rogue One had not been so good\\, I might have given up on the franchise after seeing this piece of junk. The prequels were better","true":true}
