Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story goes to a point nowhere wanted or expected to go. They throw diversity at you so subtle like a brick to the face\\, and by diversity they only mean No-White-Male as protagonists\\, but as antagonists or idiots. The backstory and even the whole character of every one was ruined in this SJW-Propaganda they call Movie. The director\\, judging his work before this\\, had a very amateur career compared with other Disney movies directors\\, J.J. Abrahams is just an example o that\\, Episode 7 was a good movie even if was Episode 4 Reboot. It started something that could be (And was expected to) an amazing new story with the Star Wars Universe in it\\, not a crappy story-characters-acting-oppresor-diversity-animal cruelty-powerful and independent women-racially inclusive show. I throw my cup of Pepsi at the floor of the movie and punched the god damn wall as I walked out trying to not doing a show. Somehow the audience in there didn't react bad like they know why I did that. Please watch this movie just to let you know HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. Forced scenes\\, forced comedy\\, scenes explained so bad\\, plot points and plot holes that didn't do a thing in the movie than just being weird\\, irrelevant and distract the viewer. The introduction of Yoda to have some nostalgia is SO cringy\\, innecesary and out of place that make me face palm. The backstory of the main protagonist (Which I don't have a problem with female protagonists at all\\, I have a problem when the diversity interferes with the whole story as a whole like in this circus) is ruined in a single scene. The main Villain who we didn't know a thing about and was very interesting in the past movie was killed like nothing\\, did Rian Johnson ever saw a Star Wars Movie once? I doubt it\\, he would know the true point of a Space Opera which is about triumph\\, some love in there\\, which reminds me one of the final scenes when Finn was about to sacrifice himself to give the resistance some time which to me was a very good point in the drama at last. Obviously something had to ruin it and was his love interest\\, a diverse asian girl who is in love of a black guy (So much diversity in this movie)\\, she stupidly crashes the guy to stop him from saving the resistance and killing himself\\, hurting her with bad wounds in the process\\, HOWEVER the worst part comes after they crash each other. The dialogue in that specific scene is awfully cringy and makes you question how in the world Disney allowed that without feeling the awkwardness of the whole scene. I can tell you in my personal perspective as a fan of Cinema and Star Wars every other part I think the movie is ruined but to resume:\\n\\nStar Wars Episode 8 is a broken mirror with hundreds of pieces taped together with scotch hoping to look good at someone. Rian Johnson Kill Yourself.","true":true}
