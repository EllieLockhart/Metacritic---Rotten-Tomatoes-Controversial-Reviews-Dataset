Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good looking movie with great actors and music. \\n\\nBut sorely lacking in pacing and writing while having a bit of an identity crisis. \\n\\nThis did not feel like a great space fantasy adventure taking place in the star wars universe.\\n\\nhonestly i feel like the critics here either didn't really watch the movie properly or they got paid by Disney. If normal users can cheat why wouldn't companies??","true":true}
