Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really like movie.  I have been a star war fan since I was little girl.  \\n\\nI was little sad on the ending but I understand the ending and what it means. \\n\\nOnly thing that I didn't like about movie\\, it is Reg parents.","true":true}
