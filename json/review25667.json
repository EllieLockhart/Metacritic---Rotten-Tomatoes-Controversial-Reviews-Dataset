Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a russian bot\\nPlot was full of holes.\\nToo many forced jokes.\\nLiterally half of the movie was inconsequential.\\nObvious political preaching.\\nPretty much took a big steamy one all over Luke Skywalker.\\nHalf a star because the special effects are good","true":true}
