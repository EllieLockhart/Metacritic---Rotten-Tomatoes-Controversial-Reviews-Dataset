The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let me say that I didn't see any spoilers\/leaks before my play through and did not watch any reviews on the game until i finished it. Now the gameplay in my opinion is very very smooth and only gets boring for me at the end of the game\\, when you get to play as Ellie again. My high points were fighting the rat king as abby\\, the car scene with Jesse and the Chase scene with Dina on the end of the first day. Now to the people out there that are hating on the game\\, half the people I hear complaining about it have not even played the game and just see how everyone is hating on it and watches one review and then says its a bad game. NO STOP IT\\, play the game\\, and then have your opinion. Now my honest thoughts on the game\\, I loved it\\, and thats enough. The ending wasnt unfullfilling\\, if you were expecting the story to go the way you wanted\/expected thats just wrong to think that way. Just because Joel died doesn't make it a bad game\\, his death wasn't handled porely\\, he for the past 4 years has been trying to become a better person\\, so is everyone at tommy's place as shown through letters\\, also having us play as Abby was fine\\, we were so set on hating her for killing joel as we all had that connection with Joel but if we are able to keep an open mind we see how horrible his actions really were and that they did have to bit him in the back at some point. The story was all that it needed to be\\, and thats all that it was\\, a story. Now please be respected to your own opinion and don't let people steer your opinion to something its not. Just because I loved this game doesn't mean you have too\\, but just because alot of people hate it doesn't mean you do as well.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
