Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It truly doesn't deserve a half star.  I let this digest through the night as I didn't want to over react.  I woke up this morning and gained 40lbs from stress eating in 7 hours...  It was awful!  We left TFA with 3 things\\, in my opinion\\, that peaked our interest. 1). Luke's back... How awesome will he be?  2).  Who are Rey's parents?  3). Snoke?!?!  Who is this character and how bad is he?\\n\\nAnswers: \\n\\n1).  Luke\\, and icon in cinematic history\\, is now a completely ruined wimp with force abilities that rival children\\, yet he defeated the supposed biggest bad in Vador\\, and has become a nuanced\\, nobody.  I don't watch Star Wars for nuance\\, I like it for the hero's journey and their decency that overcomes the ill's of everyday life\\, escapism is to lift moral not self indulge!   Luke's story line... FAIL and his character is ruined\\, forever!\\n\\n2). Rey's parents... Nobody's!  At least through this terrible movie!  FAIL #2\\n\\n3). Snoke = Darth Maul all over again!  So much potential\\, so much hope to rival Vador for biggest bad in Star Wars and now... He two is halved!  Fail #3\\n\\nThis doesn't include the awful CGI\\, the Rose character\\, the new Marvel version of Super-Leia (which showed more force ability than Luke) and Rey and Kylo being the greatest force users EVER yet haven't been trained. \\n\\nIf you love Star Wars... and I mean love Star Wars like I do\\, then please save yourself\\, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!","true":true}
