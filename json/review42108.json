Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie receives way too much hatred from what it deserves\\, in fact it gets the most undeserved hatred from fans out of all the Star Wars movies since the prequels. The movie isn't bad\\, but it's not great either. It's definitely one of the weaker Star Wars movies and it may have it's faults\\, but I still think the movie's alright. Underrated by audiences and overrated by critics. Overall\\, this movie was fine.","true":true}
