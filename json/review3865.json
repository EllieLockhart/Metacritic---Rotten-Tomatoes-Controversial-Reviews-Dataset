Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bland\\, uninspired. Requires screwing with old characters to manufacture drama. I'm not an OT-obsessed nerd but the writing in this is really cringey at times\\, and the Rey-Kylo love plot is straight from an anime. Kylo is an edgelord still. Rey can do everything and is pure virtue. Porgs are more tasteless than anything in the prequel trilogy.\\nOnly positives (and reasons I'm not giving half a star):\\n-Snokes throne room\\, the praetorian guards and the soundtrack piece that accompanied those scenes were awesome. Something unholy and terrifying. Can't put into words except that it felt profanely paganistic like the madly insane Roman emperor's throne room. If Snoke wasn't such a crap villain these scenes could have actually been good despite the terrible Kylo and Rey plotpoints highlight in them.\\n-Daisy Ridley's acting was actually not bad. She was able to convey emotions without being wide-eyed mouth agape 100% of the film as in TFA.","true":true}
