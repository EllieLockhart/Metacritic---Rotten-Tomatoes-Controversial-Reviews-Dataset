Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, The Force Awakens was clearly the last Star wars movie. Between that and TLJ\\, complete Disneyfication appears to have occurred. I genuinely spent the first ten minutes thinking it was some kind of Star Wars spoof. the scripting is lazy and poor\\, like they just couldn't be bothered\\, and the jokes are so far off what original Star Wars humour was that they may as well have come from another galaxy. I love Ade Edmondon\\, but in Star Wars? No. Too well known and too associated\\, for me at least\\, with absurdist humour to blend into the SW universe. I have been a huge fan of star wars since 1977 and was very pleasantly surprised by the Force Awakens\\, despite my initial concerns. TLJ is the first 'Star Wars' film I had to turn off half way through. Star Wars it is not. Good luck with the Disney series\\, but I have to part company here.","true":true}
