Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An overlong\\, incoherent mess with glaring plot holes and oddities\\, nonsensical plot points\\, inconsistent characters\\, out-of-place comedy\\, missed opportunities and pandering to the audience gives the finger to the whole Star Wars legacy. The few positives include beautiful visuals and a strong performance from Mark Hamill as a badly written Luke Skywalker. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are doing some fine work here\\, too.","true":true}
