{"101487":184941,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't as terrible as every says\\, but it definitely had issues. It's certainly entertaining\\, but any closer look and this movie falls apart.\\n\\nSPOILERS DOWN BELOW\\n\\nI'm mainly going to focus on the negatives in this review. If you like Star Wars\\, you'll like this movie anyways\\, so there's really no point in praising it. I didn't have a problem with the political messages in the movie as so many other people did\\, either.\\n\\nThe plot of this movie is pretty dull compared to the other star wars films\\, even the prequels. The First Order chasing the resistance and waiting for them to run out of fuel because they're just out of range? Seriously? That's not the most exciting plot in the world.\\n\\nAlright. My biggest issue with this movie is how they took everything that The Force Awakens built up and just threw it out the window. The four prime examples are Snoke\\, Luke\\, Rey\\, and the force itself.\\n\\nSnoke was the most insulting out of these four. After The Force Awakens\\, my main questions were: \\\"WHO IS SNOKE?\\\" \\\"Where did he come from?\\\" \\\"Why is he so powerful in the dark side?\\\". This movie is just a giant 'fuck you' to those questions. He has no more character development\\, and then Kylo Ren just kills him halfway through the movie. This pissed me off. It seemed way too reminiscent of General Grievous or Count Dooku\\, who just appeared out of no-where\\, and then were dead a movie later\\, or in Grievous' case\\, in the same movie. This is my biggest complaint with this movie.\\n\\nLuke was pretty bad too. He devolved from a hero and self-sacrificing in The Return of the Jedi to a whiny old asshole in The Last Jedi. I mean seriously\\, the Luke Skywalker we were left with in episode 6 didn't contemplate murdering family members in cold blood. He even spared his father's life at the end of episode 6. \\n\\nRey wasn't as big of an issue as Luke of Snoke was\\, but she's still pretty much a Mary Sue in this movie. She's amazing at the force just 'because'. She didn't even receive any training from Luke. I know people are born amazingly talented at certain things\\, but in a movie\\, it dissolves any potential relatability to the character. She has no character flaws of any sort\\, which is irritating. If you're going to make a strong female character for young women to look up to\\, don't make her basically Dwayne Johnson in a Fast and Furious movie.\\n\\nThe Force was another issue with The Last Jedi. It was basically a deus-ex-machina in this film. Jedi ghosts can suddenly control the weather\\, Luke can create a manifestation of himself\\, conscious connections can be formed\\, Leia can fly through space. It's just a mess.\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie is entertaining\\, but a massive disappointment as a followup to The Force Awakens. If you're a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, you're probably going to be annoyed by this film.","true":true}
