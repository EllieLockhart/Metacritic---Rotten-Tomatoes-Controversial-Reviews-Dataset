Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched this movie about a dozen times now. scene 13 'survival' I just fast forward the whole thing and pretend that nonsense never happened and Leia just got knocked unconscious due to an explosion. I can deal with what they've done to Luke\\, the self fulfilling prophecy. but the one thing that I cannot wrap my head around at all is the fuel. this is the worst story ever told in Star wars. fuel? really. how is it the first order was making light speed jumps before they reached the rebels but they have fuel. how does the millennium falcon travel through hyperspace\\, drop Rey off to meet kylo Ren\\, jump back into hyperspace\\, and then have enough fuel to evacuate them? that's 2 jumps and possibly a third once they grabbed Poe and fynn. but the main resistance shop has only enough fuel to make one light speed jump? explain this to me because honestly it makes no sense and it's the main part of the movie. I wish this movie didn't exist","true":true}
